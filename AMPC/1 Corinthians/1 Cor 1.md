# 1 Corinthians 1

***














###### 1 






Paul, summoned by the will _and_ purpose of God to be an apostle (special messenger) of Christ Jesus, and our brother Sosthenes, 













###### 2 






To the church (assembly) of God which is in Corinth, to those consecrated _and_ purified _and_ made holy in Christ Jesus, [who are] selected _and_ called to be saints (God's people), together with all those who in any place call upon _and_ give honor to the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both their Lord and ours: 













###### 3 






Grace (favor and spiritual blessing) be to you and [heart] peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 













###### 4 






I thank my God at all times for you because of the grace (the favor and spiritual blessing) of God which was bestowed on you in Christ Jesus, 













###### 5 






[So] that in Him in every respect you were enriched, in full power _and_ readiness of speech [to speak of your faith] and complete knowledge _and_ illumination [to give you full insight into its meaning]. 













###### 6 






In this way [our] witnessing concerning Christ (the Messiah) was so confirmed _and_ established _and_ made sure in you 













###### 7 






That you are not [consciously] falling behind _or_ lacking in any special spiritual endowment _or_ Christian grace [[^a]the reception of which is due to the power of divine grace operating in your souls by the Holy Spirit], while you wait _and_ watch [constantly living in hope] for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ _and_ [His] being made visible to all. 













###### 8 






And He will establish you to the end [keep you steadfast, give you strength, and guarantee your vindication; He will be your warrant against all accusation or indictment so that you will be] guiltless _and_ irreproachable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah). 













###### 9 






God is faithful (reliable, trustworthy, and therefore ever true to His promise, and He can be depended on); by Him you were called into companionship _and_ participation with His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. 













###### 10 






But I urge _and_ entreat you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you be in perfect harmony _and_ full agreement in what you say, and that there be no dissensions _or_ factions _or_ divisions among you, but that you be perfectly united in your common understanding and in your opinions _and_ judgments. 













###### 11 






For it has been made clear to me, my brethren, by those of Chloe's household, that there are contentions _and_ wrangling _and_ factions among you. 













###### 12 






What I mean is this, that each one of you [either] says, I belong to Paul, or I belong to Apollos, or I belong to Cephas (Peter), or I belong to Christ. 













###### 13 






Is Christ (the Messiah) divided into parts? Was Paul crucified on behalf of you? Or were you baptized into the name of Paul? 













###### 14 






I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius, 













###### 15 






Lest anyone should say that I baptized in my own name. 













###### 16 






[Yes] I did baptize the household of Stephanas also. More than these, I do not remember that I baptized anyone. 













###### 17 






For Christ (the Messiah) sent me out not to baptize but [to evangelize by] preaching the glad tidings (the Gospel), and that not with verbal eloquence, lest the cross of Christ should be deprived of force _and_ emptied of its power _and_ rendered vain (fruitless, void of value, and of no effect). 













###### 18 






For the story _and_ message of the cross is sheer absurdity _and_ folly to those who are perishing _and_ on their way to perdition, but to us who are being saved it is the [manifestation of] the power of God. 













###### 19 






For it is written, I will baffle _and_ render useless _and_ destroy the learning of the learned _and_ the philosophy of the philosophers and the cleverness of the clever _and_ the discernment of the discerning; I will frustrate _and_ nullify [them] _and_ bring [them] to nothing. 













###### 20 






Where is the wise man (the philosopher)? Where is the scribe (the scholar)? Where is the investigator (the logician, the debater) of this present time _and_ age? Has not God shown up the nonsense _and_ the folly of this world's wisdom? 













###### 21 






For when the world with all its earthly wisdom failed to perceive _and_ recognize _and_ know God by means of its own philosophy, God in His wisdom was pleased through the foolishness of preaching [salvation, procured by Christ and to be had through Him], to save those who believed (who clung to and trusted in and relied on Him). 













###### 22 






For while Jews [demandingly] ask for signs _and_ miracles and Greeks pursue philosophy _and_ wisdom, 













###### 23 






We preach Christ (the Messiah) crucified, [preaching which] to the Jews is a scandal _and_ an offensive stumbling block [that springs a snare or trap], and to the Gentiles it is absurd _and_ utterly unphilosophical nonsense. 













###### 24 






But to those who are called, whether Jew or Greek (Gentile), Christ [is] the Power of God and the Wisdom of God. 













###### 25 






[This is] because the foolish thing [that has its source in] God is wiser than men, and the weak thing [that springs] from God is stronger than men. 













###### 26 






For [simply] consider your own call, brethren; not many [of you were considered to be] wise according to human estimates _and_ standards, not many influential _and_ powerful, not many of high _and_ noble birth. 













###### 27 






[No] for God selected (deliberately chose) what in the world is foolish to put the wise to shame, and what the world calls weak to put the strong to shame. 













###### 28 






And God also selected (deliberately chose) what in the world is lowborn _and_ insignificant and branded _and_ treated with contempt, even the things that are nothing, that He might depose _and_ bring to nothing the things that are, 













###### 29 






So that no mortal man should [have pretense for glorying and] boast in the presence of God. 













###### 30 






But it is from Him that you have your life in Christ Jesus, Whom God made our Wisdom from God, [revealed to us a knowledge of the divine plan of salvation previously hidden, manifesting itself as] our Righteousness [thus making us upright and putting us in right standing with God], and our Consecration [making us pure and holy], and our Redemption [providing our ransom from eternal penalty for sin]. 













###### 31 






So then, as it is written, Let him who boasts _and_ proudly rejoices _and_ glories, boast _and_ proudly rejoice _and_ glory in the Lord. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

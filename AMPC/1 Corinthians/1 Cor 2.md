# 1 Corinthians 2

***














###### 1 






As for myself, brethren, when I came to you, I did not come proclaiming to you the testimony _and_ evidence _or_ [^a]_mystery and secret_ of God [concerning what He has done through Christ for the salvation of men] in lofty words of eloquence or human philosophy _and_ wisdom; 













###### 2 






For I resolved to know nothing (to be acquainted with nothing, to make a display of the knowledge of nothing, and to be conscious of nothing) among you except Jesus Christ (the Messiah) and Him crucified. 













###### 3 






And I was in ([^b]passed into a state of) weakness and fear (dread) and great trembling [[^c]after I had come] among you. 













###### 4 






And my language and my message were not set forth in persuasive (enticing and plausible) words of wisdom, but they were in demonstration of the [Holy] Spirit and power [[^d]a proof by the Spirit and power of God, operating on me and stirring in the minds of my hearers the most holy emotions and thus persuading them], 













###### 5 






So that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men (human philosophy), but in the power of God. 













###### 6 






Yet when we are among the full-grown (spiritually mature Christians who are ripe in understanding), we do impart a [higher] wisdom (the knowledge of the divine plan previously hidden); but it is indeed not a wisdom of this present age _or_ of this world nor of the leaders _and_ rulers of this age, who are being brought to nothing _and_ are doomed to pass away. 













###### 7 






But rather what we are setting forth is a wisdom of God once hidden [from the human understanding] and now revealed to us by God--[that wisdom] which God devised _and_ decreed before the ages for our glorification [to lift us into the glory of His presence]. 













###### 8 






None of the rulers of this age _or_ world perceived _and_ recognized _and_ understood this, for if they had, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory. 













###### 9 






But, on the contrary, as the Scripture says, What eye has not seen and ear has not heard and has not entered into the heart of man, [all that] God has prepared (made and keeps ready) for those who love Him [[^e]who hold Him in affectionate reverence, promptly obeying Him and gratefully recognizing the benefits He has bestowed]. 













###### 10 






Yet to us God has unveiled _and_ revealed them by _and_ through His Spirit, for the [Holy] Spirit searches diligently, exploring _and_ examining everything, even sounding the profound and bottomless things of God [the [^f]divine counsels and things hidden and beyond man's scrutiny]. 













###### 11 






For what person perceives (knows and understands) what passes through a man's thoughts except the man's own spirit within him? Just so no one discerns (comes to know and comprehend) the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. 













###### 12 






Now we have not received the spirit [that belongs to] the world, but the [Holy] Spirit Who is from God, [given to us] that we might realize _and_ comprehend _and_ appreciate the gifts [of divine favor and blessing so freely and lavishly] bestowed on us by God. 













###### 13 






And we are setting these truths forth in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the [Holy] Spirit, combining _and_ interpreting spiritual truths with spiritual language [to those who possess the Holy Spirit]. 













###### 14 






But the natural, nonspiritual man does not accept _or_ welcome _or_ admit into his heart the gifts _and_ teachings _and_ revelations of the Spirit of God, for they are folly (meaningless nonsense) to him; and he is incapable of knowing them [of progressively recognizing, understanding, and becoming better acquainted with them] because they are spiritually discerned _and_ estimated _and_ appreciated. 













###### 15 






But the spiritual man tries all things [he [^g]examines, investigates, inquires into, questions, and discerns all things], yet is himself to be put on trial and judged by no one [he can read the meaning of everything, but no one can properly discern _or_ appraise _or_ get an insight into him]. 













###### 16 






For who has known _or_ understood the mind (the counsels and purposes) of the Lord so as to guide _and_ instruct Him _and_ give Him knowledge? But we have the mind of Christ (the Messiah) _and_ do hold the thoughts (feelings and purposes) of His heart. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

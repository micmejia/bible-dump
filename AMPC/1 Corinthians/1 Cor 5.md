# 1 Corinthians 5

***














###### 1 






It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, impurity of a sort that is condemned _and_ does not occur even among the heathen; for a man has [his own] father's wife. 













###### 2 






And you are proud _and_ arrogant! And you ought rather to mourn (bow in sorrow and in shame) until the person who has done this [shameful] thing is removed from your fellowship _and_ your midst! 













###### 3 






As for my attitude, though I am absent [from you] in body, I am present in spirit, and I have already decided _and_ passed judgment, as if actually present, 













###### 4 






In the name of the Lord Jesus _Christ_, on the man who has committed such a deed. When you and my own spirit are met together with the power of our Lord Jesus, 













###### 5 






You are to deliver this man over to Satan [^a]for physical discipline [to destroy carnal lusts which prompted him to incest], that [his] spirit may [yet] be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. 













###### 6 






[About the condition of your church] your boasting is not good [indeed, it is most unseemly and entirely out of place]. Do you not know that [just] a little leaven will ferment the whole lump [of dough]? 













###### 7 






Purge (clean out) the old leaven that you may be fresh (new) dough, still uncontaminated [as you are], for Christ, our Passover [Lamb], has been sacrificed. 













###### 8 






Therefore, let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, nor with leaven of vice _and_ malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened [bread] of purity (nobility, honor) _and_ sincerity and [unadulterated] truth. 













###### 9 






I wrote you in my [previous] letter not to associate [closely and habitually] with unchaste (impure) people-- 













###### 10 






Not [meaning of course that you must] altogether shun the immoral people of this world, or the greedy graspers and cheats _and_ thieves or idolaters, since otherwise you would need to get out of the world _and_ human society altogether! 













###### 11 






But now I write to you not to associate with anyone who bears the name of [Christian] brother if he is known to be guilty of immorality or greed, or is an idolater [whose soul is devoted to any object that usurps the place of God], or is a person with a foul tongue [railing, abusing, reviling, slandering], or is a drunkard or a swindler _or_ a robber. [No] you must not so much as eat with such a person. 













###### 12 






What [business] of mine is it _and_ what right have I to judge outsiders? Is it not those inside [the church] upon whom you are to pass disciplinary judgment [passing censuring sentence on them as the facts require]? 













###### 13 






God alone sits in judgment on those who are outside. Drive out that wicked one from among you [expel him from your church]. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

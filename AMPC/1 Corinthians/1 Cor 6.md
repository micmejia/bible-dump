# 1 Corinthians 6

***














###### 1 






Does any of you dare, when he has a matter of complaint against another [brother], to go to law before unrighteous men [men neither upright nor right with God, laying it before them] instead of before the saints (the people of God)? 













###### 2 






Do you not know that the saints (the believers) will [one day] judge _and_ govern the world? And if the world [itself] is to be judged _and_ ruled by you, are you unworthy _and_ incompetent to try [such petty matters] of the smallest courts of justice? 













###### 3 






Do you not know also that we [Christians] are to judge the [very] angels _and_ pronounce opinion between right and wrong [for them]? How much more then [as to] matters pertaining to this world _and_ of this life only! 













###### 4 






If then you do have such cases of everyday life to decide, why do you appoint [as judges to lay them before] those who [from the standpoint] of the church count for least _and_ are without standing? 













###### 5 






I say this to move you to shame. Can it be that there really is not one man among you who [in action is governed by piety and integrity and] is wise _and_ competent enough to decide [the private grievances, disputes, and quarrels] between members of the brotherhood, 













###### 6 






But brother goes to law against brother, and that before [Gentile judges who are] unbelievers [without faith or trust in the Gospel of Christ]? 













###### 7 






Why, the very fact of your having lawsuits with one another at all is a defect (a defeat, an evidence of positive moral loss for you). Why not rather let yourselves suffer wrong _and_ be deprived of what is your due? Why not rather be cheated (defrauded and robbed)? 













###### 8 






But [instead it is you] yourselves who wrong and defraud, and that even your own brethren [by so treating them]! 













###### 9 






Do you not know that the unrighteous _and_ the wrongdoers will not inherit _or_ have any share in the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived (misled): neither the impure _and_ immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor those who participate in homosexuality, 













###### 10 






Nor cheats (swindlers and thieves), nor greedy graspers, nor drunkards, nor foulmouthed revilers _and_ slanderers, nor extortioners _and_ robbers will inherit _or_ have any share in the kingdom of God. 













###### 11 






And such some of you were [once]. But you were washed clean (purified by a complete atonement for sin and made free from the guilt of sin), and you were consecrated (set apart, hallowed), and you were justified [pronounced righteous, by trusting] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the [Holy] Spirit of our God. 













###### 12 






Everything is permissible (allowable and lawful) for me; but not all things are helpful (good for me to do, expedient and profitable when considered with other things). Everything is lawful for me, but I will not become the slave of anything _or_ be brought under its power. 













###### 13 






Food [is intended] for the stomach and the stomach for food, but God will finally end [the functions of] both _and_ bring them to nothing. The body is not intended for sexual immorality, but [is intended] for the Lord, and the Lord [is intended] for the body [[^a]to save, sanctify, and raise it again]. 













###### 14 






And God both raised the Lord to life and will also raise us up by His power. 













###### 15 






Do you not see _and_ know that your bodies are members (bodily parts) of Christ (the Messiah)? Am I therefore to take the parts of Christ and make [them] parts of a prostitute? Never! Never! 













###### 16 






Or do you not know _and_ realize that when a man joins himself to a prostitute, he becomes one body with her? The two, it is written, shall become one flesh. 













###### 17 






But the person who is united to the Lord becomes one spirit with Him. 













###### 18 






Shun immorality _and_ all sexual looseness [flee from impurity in thought, word, or deed]. Any other sin which a man commits is one outside the body, but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body. 













###### 19 






Do you not know that your body is the temple (the very sanctuary) of the Holy Spirit Who lives within you, Whom you have received [as a Gift] from God? You are not your own, 













###### 20 






You were bought with a price [purchased with a [^b]preciousness and paid for, [^c]made His own]. So then, honor God _and_ bring glory to Him in your body.

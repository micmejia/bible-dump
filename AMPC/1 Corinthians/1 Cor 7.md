# 1 Corinthians 7

***














###### 1 






Now as to the matters of which you wrote me. It is well [and by that I mean advantageous, expedient, profitable, and wholesome] for a man not to touch a woman [to cohabit with her] _but_ to remain unmarried. 













###### 2 






But because of the temptation to impurity _and_ to avoid immorality, let each [man] have his own wife and let each [woman] have her own husband. 













###### 3 






The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights (goodwill, kindness, and what is due her as his wife), and likewise the wife to her husband. 













###### 4 






For the wife does not have [exclusive] authority _and_ control over her own body, but the husband [has his rights]; likewise also the husband does not have [exclusive] authority _and_ control over his body, but the wife [has her rights]. 













###### 5 






Do not refuse _and_ deprive _and_ defraud each other [of your due marital rights], except perhaps by mutual consent for a time, so that you may devote yourselves unhindered to prayer. But afterwards resume marital relations, lest Satan tempt you [to sin] through your lack of restraint of sexual desire. 













###### 6 






But I am saying this more as a matter of permission _and_ concession, not as a command _or_ regulation. 













###### 7 






I wish that all men were like I myself am [in this matter of self-control]. But each has his own special gift from God, one of this kind and one of another. 













###### 8 






But to the unmarried people and to the widows, I declare that it is well (good, advantageous, expedient, and wholesome) for them to remain [single] even as I do. 













###### 9 






But if they have not self-control (restraint of their passions), they should marry. For it is better to marry than to be aflame [with passion and tortured continually with ungratified desire]. 













###### 10 






But to the married people I give charge--not I but the Lord--that the wife is not to separate from her husband. 













###### 11 






But if she does [separate from and divorce him], let her remain single or else be reconciled to her husband. And [I charge] the husband [also] that he should not put away _or_ divorce his wife. 













###### 12 






To the rest I declare--I, not the Lord [for Jesus did not discuss this]--that if any brother has a wife who does not believe [in Christ] and she consents to live with him, he should not leave _or_ divorce her. 













###### 13 






And if any woman has an unbelieving husband and he consents to live with her, she should not leave _or_ divorce him. 













###### 14 






For the unbelieving husband is set apart (separated, withdrawn from heathen contamination, and affiliated with the Christian people) by union with his consecrated (set-apart) wife, and the unbelieving wife is set apart _and_ separated through union with her consecrated husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean (unblessed heathen, [^a]outside the Christian covenant), but as it is they are [^b]prepared for God [pure and clean]. 













###### 15 






But if the unbelieving partner [actually] leaves, let him do so; in such [cases the remaining] brother or sister is not morally bound. But God has called us to peace. 













###### 16 






For, wife, how can you be sure of converting _and_ saving your husband? Husband, how can you be sure of converting _and_ saving your wife? 













###### 17 






Only, let each one [seek to conduct himself and regulate his affairs so as to] lead the life which the Lord has allotted _and_ imparted to him and to which God has invited _and_ summoned him. This is my order in all the churches. 













###### 18 






Was anyone at the time of his summons [from God] already circumcised? Let him not seek to remove the evidence of circumcision. Was anyone at the time [God] called him uncircumcised? Let him not be circumcised. 













###### 19 






For circumcision is nothing _and_ counts for nothing, neither does uncircumcision, but [what counts is] keeping the commandments of God. 













###### 20 






Everyone should remain after God calls him in the station _or_ condition of life in which the summons found him. 













###### 21 






Were you a slave when you were called? Do not let that trouble you. But if you are able to gain your freedom, avail yourself of the opportunity. 













###### 22 






For he who as a slave was summoned in [to union with] the Lord is a freedman of the Lord, just so he who was free when he was called is a bond servant of Christ (the Messiah). 













###### 23 






You were bought with a price [purchased with a preciousness and paid for by Christ]; then do not yield yourselves up to become [in your own estimation] slaves to men [but consider yourselves slaves to Christ]. 













###### 24 






So, brethren, in whatever station _or_ state _or_ condition of life each one was when he was called, there let him continue with _and_ close to God. 













###### 25 






Now concerning the virgins (the marriageable [^c]maidens) I have no command of the Lord, but I give my opinion _and_ advice as one who by the Lord's mercy is rendered trustworthy _and_ faithful. 













###### 26 






I think then, because of the impending distress [that is even now setting in], it is well (expedient, profitable, and wholesome) for a person to remain as he _or_ she is. 













###### 27 






Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be free. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek a wife. 













###### 28 






But if you do marry, you do not sin [in doing so], and if a virgin marries, she does not sin [in doing so]. Yet those who marry will have physical _and_ earthly troubles, and I would like to spare you that. 













###### 29 






I mean, brethren, the appointed time has been [^d]winding down _and_ it has grown very short. From now on, let even those who have wives be as if they had none, 













###### 30 






And those who weep _and_ mourn as though they were not weeping _and_ mourning, and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing, and those who buy as though they did not possess anything, 













###### 31 






And those who deal with this world [[^e]overusing the enjoyments of this life] as though they were not absorbed by it _and_ as if they had no dealings with it. For the outward form of this world (the present world order) is passing away. 













###### 32 






My desire is to have you free from all anxiety _and_ distressing care. The unmarried man is anxious about the things of the Lord--how he may please the Lord; 













###### 33 






But the married man is anxious about worldly matters--how he may please his wife-- 













###### 34 






And he is drawn in diverging directions [his interests are divided _and_ he is distracted from his devotion to God]. And the unmarried woman or girl is concerned _and_ anxious about the matters of the Lord, how to be wholly separated _and_ set apart in body and spirit; but the married woman has her cares [centered] in earthly affairs--how she may please her husband. 













###### 35 






Now I say this for your own welfare _and_ profit, not to put [a halter of] restraint upon you, but to promote what is seemly _and_ in good order and to secure your undistracted _and_ undivided devotion to the Lord. 













###### 36 






But if any man thinks that he is not acting properly toward _and_ in regard to his virgin [that he is preparing disgrace for her or incurring reproach], in case she is passing the bloom of her youth and if there is need for it, let him do what to him seems right; he does not sin; let them marry. 













###### 37 






But whoever is firmly established in his heart [strong in mind and purpose], not being forced by necessity but having control over his own will _and_ desire, and has resolved this in his heart to keep his own virginity, he is doing well. 













###### 38 






So also then, he [the father] who gives his virgin (his daughter) in marriage does well, and he [the father] who does not give [her] in marriage does better. 













###### 39 






A wife is bound to her husband by law as long as he lives. If the husband dies, she is free to be married to whom she will, only [provided that he too is] in the Lord. 













###### 40 






But in my opinion [a widow] is happier (more blessed and [^f]to be envied) if she does not remarry. And also I think I have the Spirit of God.

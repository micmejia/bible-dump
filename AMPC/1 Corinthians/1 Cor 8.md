# 1 Corinthians 8

***














###### 1 






Now about food offered to idols: of course we know that all of us possess knowledge [concerning these matters. Yet mere] knowledge causes people to be puffed up (to bear themselves loftily and be proud), but love (affection and goodwill and benevolence) edifies _and_ builds up _and_ encourages one to grow [to his full stature]. 













###### 2 






If anyone imagines that he has come to know _and_ understand much [of divine things, without love], he does not yet perceive _and_ recognize _and_ understand as strongly _and_ clearly, _nor_ has he become as intimately acquainted with anything as he ought _or_ as is necessary. 













###### 3 






But if one loves God truly [[^a]with affectionate reverence, prompt obedience, and grateful recognition of His blessing], he is known by God [[^b]recognized as worthy of His intimacy and love, and he is owned by Him]. 













###### 4 






In this matter, then, of eating food offered to idols, we know that an idol is nothing (has no real existence) and that there is no God but one. 













###### 5 






For although there may be so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth, as indeed there are many of them, both of gods and of lords _and_ masters, 













###### 6 






Yet for us there is [only] one God, the Father, Who is the Source of all things and for Whom we [have life], and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through _and_ by Whom are all things and through _and_ by Whom we [ourselves exist]. 













###### 7 






Nevertheless, not all [believers] possess this knowledge. But some, through being all their lives until now accustomed to [thinking of] idols [as real and living], still consider the food [offered to an idol] as that sacrificed to an [actual] god; and their weak consciences become defiled _and_ injured if they eat [it]. 













###### 8 






Now food [itself] will not cause our acceptance by God _nor_ commend us to Him. Eating [food offered to idols] gives us no advantage; neither do we come short _or_ become any worse if we do not eat [it]. 













###### 9 






Only be careful that this power of choice (this permission and liberty to do as you please) which is yours, does not [somehow] become a hindrance (cause of stumbling) to the weak _or_ overscrupulous [giving them an impulse to sin]. 













###### 10 






For suppose someone sees you, a man having knowledge [of God, with an intelligent view of this subject and] reclining at table in an idol's temple, might he not be encouraged _and_ emboldened [to violate his own conscientious scruples] if he is weak _and_ uncertain, and eat what [to him] is for the purpose of idol worship? 













###### 11 






And so by your enlightenment (your knowledge of spiritual things), this weak man is ruined (is lost and perishes)--the brother for whom Christ (the Messiah) died! 













###### 12 






And when you sin against your brethren in this way, wounding _and_ damaging their weak conscience, you sin against Christ. 













###### 13 






Therefore, if [my eating a] food is a cause of my brother's falling _or_ of hindering [his spiritual advancement], I will not eat [such] flesh forever, lest I cause my brother to be tripped up _and_ fall _and_ to be offended.

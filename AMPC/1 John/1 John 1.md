# 1 John 1

***














###### 1 






[We are writing] about the Word of Life [[^a]in] Him Who existed from the beginning, Whom we have heard, Whom we have seen with our [own] eyes, Whom we have gazed upon [for ourselves] and have touched with our [own] hands. 













###### 2 






And the Life [[^b]an aspect of His being] was revealed (made manifest, demonstrated), and we saw [as eyewitnesses] and are testifying to and declare to you the Life, the eternal Life [[^c]in Him] Who already existed with the Father and Who [actually] was made visible (was revealed) to us [His followers]. 













###### 3 






What we have seen and [ourselves] heard, we are also telling you, so that you too may [^d]realize _and_ enjoy fellowship as partners _and_ partakers with us. And [this] fellowship that we have [which is a [^e]distinguishing mark of Christians] is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ (the Messiah). 













###### 4 






And we are now writing these things to you so that our joy [in seeing you included] may be full [and [^f]_your_ joy may be complete]. 













###### 5 






And this is the message [the message of [^g]promise] which we have heard from Him and now are reporting to you: God is Light, and there is no darkness in Him at all [[^h]no, not in any way]. 













###### 6 






[So] if we say we are partakers together _and_ enjoy fellowship with Him when we live _and_ move _and_ are walking about in darkness, we are [both] speaking falsely and do not live _and_ practice the Truth [which the Gospel presents]. 













###### 7 






But if we [really] are living _and_ walking in the Light, as He [Himself] is in the Light, we have [true, unbroken] fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus _Christ_ His Son cleanses (removes) us from all sin _and_ guilt [keeps us cleansed from sin in all its forms and manifestations]. 













###### 8 






If we say we have no sin [refusing to admit that we are sinners], we delude _and_ lead ourselves astray, and the Truth [which the Gospel presents] is not in us [does not dwell in our hearts]. 













###### 9 






If we [freely] admit that we have sinned _and_ confess our sins, He is faithful and just (true to His own nature and promises) and will forgive our sins [dismiss our lawlessness] and [continuously] cleanse us from all unrighteousness [everything not in conformity to His will in purpose, thought, and action]. 













###### 10 






If we say (claim) we have not sinned, we contradict His Word _and_ make Him out to be false _and_ a liar, and His Word is not in us [the divine message of the Gospel is not in our hearts].

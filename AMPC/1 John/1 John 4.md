# 1 John 4

***














###### 1 






Beloved, do not put faith in every spirit, but prove (test) the spirits to discover whether they proceed from God; for many false prophets have gone forth into the world. 













###### 2 






By this you may know (perceive and recognize) the Spirit of God: every spirit which acknowledges _and_ confesses [the fact] that Jesus Christ (the Messiah) [actually] has become man _and_ has come in the flesh is of God [has God for its source]; 













###### 3 






And every spirit which does not acknowledge _and_ confess _that_ Jesus _Christ has come in the flesh_ [but would [^a]annul, destroy, [^b]sever, disunite Him] is not of God [does not proceed from Him]. This [[^c]nonconfession] is the [spirit] of the antichrist, [of] which you heard that it was coming, and now it is already in the world. 













###### 4 






Little children, you are of God [you belong to Him] and have [already] defeated _and_ overcome them [the agents of the antichrist], because He Who lives in you is greater (mightier) than he who is in the world. 













###### 5 






They proceed from the world _and_ are of the world; therefore it is out of the world [its [^d]whole economy morally considered] that they speak, and the world listens (pays attention) to them. 













###### 6 






We are [children] of God. Whoever is learning to know God [progressively to perceive, recognize, and understand God by observation and experience, and to [^e]get an ever-clearer knowledge of Him] listens to us; and he who is not of God does not listen _or_ pay attention to us. By this we know (recognize) the Spirit of Truth and the spirit of error. 













###### 7 






Beloved, let us love one another, for love is (springs) from God; and he who loves [his fellowmen] is begotten (born) of God and is coming [progressively] to know _and_ understand God [to perceive and recognize and get a better and clearer knowledge of Him]. 













###### 8 






He who does not love has not become acquainted with God [does not and never did know Him], for God is love. 













###### 9 






In this the love of God was made manifest (displayed) where we are concerned: in that God sent His Son, the only begotten _or_ [^f]unique [Son], into the world so that we might live through Him. 













###### 10 






In this is love: not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation (the atoning sacrifice) for our sins. 













###### 11 






Beloved, if God loved us so [very much], we also ought to love one another. 













###### 12 






No man has at any time [yet] seen God. But if we love one another, God abides (lives and remains) in us and His love (that love which is essentially His) is brought to completion (to its full maturity, runs its full course, is perfected) in us! 













###### 13 






By this we come to know (perceive, recognize, and understand) that we abide (live and remain) in Him and He in us: because He has given (imparted) to us of His [Holy] Spirit. 













###### 14 






And [besides] we ourselves have seen (have deliberately and steadfastly contemplated) and bear witness that the Father has sent the Son [as the] Savior of the world. 













###### 15 






Anyone who confesses (acknowledges, owns) that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides (lives, makes His home) in him and he [abides, lives, makes his home] in God. 













###### 16 






And we know (understand, recognize, are conscious of, by observation and by experience) and believe (adhere to and put faith in and rely on) the love God cherishes for us. God is love, and he who dwells _and_ continues in love dwells _and_ continues in God, and God dwells _and_ continues in him. 













###### 17 






In this [union and communion with Him] love is brought to completion _and_ attains perfection with us, that we may have confidence for the day of judgment [with assurance and boldness to face Him], because as He is, so are we in this world. 













###### 18 






There is no fear in love [dread does not exist], but full-grown (complete, perfect) love [^g]turns fear out of doors _and_ expels every trace of terror! For fear [^h]brings with it the thought of punishment, and [so] he who is afraid has not reached the full maturity of love [is not yet grown into love's complete perfection]. 













###### 19 






We love _Him_, because He first loved us. 













###### 20 






If anyone says, I love God, and hates (detests, abominates) his brother [[^i]in Christ], he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, Whom he has not seen. 













###### 21 






And this command (charge, order, injunction) we have from Him: that he who loves God shall love his brother [[^j]believer] also.

# 1 Kings 5

***














###### 1 






Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon, when he heard that he was anointed king in place of his father, for Hiram always loved David. 













###### 2 






And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying, 













###### 3 






You know how David my father could not build a house to the Name of the Lord his God because wars were about him on every side, until the Lord put his foes under his feet. 













###### 4 






But now the Lord my God has given me rest on every side, so that there is neither adversary nor evil confronting me. 













###### 5 






And I purpose to build a house to the Name of the Lord my God, as the Lord said to David my father, Your son whom I will set on your throne in your place shall build the house to My Name _and_ Presence. 













###### 6 






So, Hiram, command them to hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; my servants shall join yours, and I will give you whatever wages you set for your servants. For you know that no one among us can equal the skill of the Sidon men in cutting timber. 













###### 7 






When Hiram heard the words of Solomon, he rejoiced greatly and said, Blessed be the Lord this day, Who has given David a wise son to be over this great people. 













###### 8 






And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things for which you sent to me; I will do all you wish concerning the cedar and cypress timber. 













###### 9 






My servants shall bring the logs down from Lebanon to the sea, make them into rafts, and float them by sea to the place that you direct. I will have them released there, and you shall take them away. And you shall fulfill my desire by providing food for my household. 













###### 10 






So Hiram gave Solomon all the cedar and cypress trees he desired, 













###### 11 






And Solomon gave Hiram 20,000 measures of wheat for food for his household, and 20 measures of pure, beaten oil. He gave these to Hiram yearly. 













###### 12 






The Lord gave Solomon wisdom, as He promised him; and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and they made a treaty. 













###### 13 






King Solomon raised a levy [of forced labor] out of all Israel; and the levy was 30,000 men. 













###### 14 






He sent them to Lebanon, 10,000 a month by divisions; one month they were in Lebanon and two months at home. Adoniram was over the levy. 













###### 15 






And Solomon had 70,000 burden bearers and 80,000 hewers [of stone] in the hill country of Judah, 













###### 16 






Besides Solomon's 3,300 overseers in charge of the people doing the work. 













###### 17 






The king commanded, and they hewed _and_ brought out [^a]great, costly stones in order to lay the foundation of the house with dressed stone. 













###### 18 






Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders and the men of Gebal did the hewing and prepared the timber and stones to build the house. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

One of them is almost thirty-nine feet long, one of the most interesting stones of the world. It is the chief cornerstone of the Mosque of Omarâ€™s massive wall, placed in its present position 3,000 years ago. Markings on the stones represent the culture of Phoenicia, the region around Tyre from which Solomon received building materials for the temple.

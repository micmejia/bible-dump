# 1 Peter 5

***














###### 1 






I warn _and_ counsel the elders among you (the pastors and spiritual guides of the church) as a fellow elder and as an eyewitness [called to testify] of the sufferings of Christ, as well as a sharer in the glory (the honor and splendor) that is to be revealed (disclosed, unfolded): 













###### 2 






Tend (nurture, guard, guide, and fold) the flock of God that is [your responsibility], not by coercion _or_ constraint, but willingly; not dishonorably motivated by the advantages _and_ profits [belonging to the office], but eagerly _and_ cheerfully; 













###### 3 






Not domineering [as arrogant, dictatorial, and overbearing persons] over those in your charge, but being examples (patterns and models of Christian living) to the flock (the congregation). 













###### 4 






And [then] when the Chief Shepherd is revealed, you will win the [^a]conqueror's crown of glory. 













###### 5 






Likewise, you who are younger _and_ of lesser rank, be subject to the elders (the ministers and spiritual guides of the church)--[giving them due respect and yielding to their counsel]. Clothe (apron) yourselves, all of you, with humility [as the garb of a servant, [^b]so that its covering cannot possibly be stripped from you, with freedom from pride and arrogance] toward one another. For God sets Himself against the proud (the insolent, the overbearing, the disdainful, the presumptuous, the boastful)--[and He opposes, frustrates, and defeats them], but gives grace (favor, blessing) to the humble. 













###### 6 






Therefore humble yourselves [demote, lower yourselves in your own estimation] under the mighty hand of God, that in due time He may exalt you, 













###### 7 






Casting the [^c]whole of your care [all your anxieties, all your worries, all your concerns, [^d]once and for all] on Him, for He cares for you affectionately _and_ cares about you [^e]watchfully. 













###### 8 






Be well balanced (temperate, sober of mind), be vigilant _and_ cautious at all times; for that enemy of yours, the devil, roams around like a lion roaring [[^f]in fierce hunger], seeking someone to seize upon _and_ devour. 













###### 9 






Withstand him; be firm in faith [against his onset--rooted, established, strong, immovable, and determined], knowing that the same ([^g]identical) sufferings are appointed to your brotherhood (the whole body of Christians) throughout the world. 













###### 10 






And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace [Who imparts all blessing and favor], Who has called you to His [own] eternal glory in Christ _Jesus_, will Himself complete _and_ make you what you ought to be, establish _and_ ground you securely, and strengthen, and settle you. 













###### 11 






To Him be the dominion (power, authority, rule) forever and ever. Amen (so be it). 













###### 12 






By Silvanus, a true (loyal, consistent, incorruptible) brother, as I consider him, I have written briefly to you, to counsel _and_ urge _and_ stimulate [you] and to declare [to you] that this is the true [account of the] grace (the undeserved favor) of God. Be steadfast _and_ persevere in it. 













###### 13 






She [your sister church here] in Babylon, [who is] elect (chosen) with [yourselves], sends you greetings, and [so does] my son (disciple) Mark. 













###### 14 






Salute one another with a kiss of love [the symbol of mutual affection]. To all of you that are in Christ _Jesus_ (the Messiah), may there be peace ([^h]every kind of peace and blessing, especially peace with God, and [^i] freedom from fears, agitating passions, and moral conflicts). _Amen (so be it)._ ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

Peter seems to have this same imagery in mind as a symbol of the heavenly reward. [^b]: 1 Peter 5:5 Johann Bengel, _Gnomon Novi Testamenti_. [^c]: 1 Peter 5:7 Marvin Vincent, _Word Studies_.

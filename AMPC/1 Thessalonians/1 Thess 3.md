# 1 Thessalonians 3

***














###### 1 






Therefore, when [the suspense of separation and our yearning for some personal communication from you] became intolerable, we consented to being left behind alone at Athens. 













###### 2 






And we sent Timothy, our brother and God's servant in [spreading] the good news (the Gospel) of Christ, to strengthen _and_ establish and to exhort _and_ comfort _and_ encourage you in your faith, 













###### 3 






That no one [of you] should be disturbed _and_ beguiled _and_ led astray by these afflictions _and_ difficulties [to which I have referred]. For you yourselves know that this is [unavoidable in our position, and must be recognized as] our appointed lot. 













###### 4 






For even when we were with you, [you know] we warned you plainly beforehand that we were to be pressed with difficulties _and_ made to suffer affliction, just as to your own knowledge it has [since] happened. 













###### 5 






That is the reason that, when I could bear [the suspense] no longer, I sent that I might learn [how you were standing the strain, and the endurance of] your faith, [for I was fearful] lest somehow the tempter had tempted you and our toil [among you should prove to] be fruitless _and_ to no purpose. 













###### 6 






But now that Timothy has just come back to us from [his visit to] you and has brought us the good news of [the steadfastness of] your faith and [the warmth of your] love, and [reported] how kindly you cherish a constant _and_ affectionate remembrance of us [and that you are] longing to see us as we [are to see] you, 













###### 7 






Brethren, for this reason, in [spite of all] our stress and crushing difficulties we have been filled with comfort _and_ cheer about you [because of] your faith ([^a]the leaning of your whole personality on God in complete trust and confidence). 













###### 8 






Because now we [really] live, if you stand [firm] in the Lord. 













###### 9 






For what [adequate] thanksgiving can we render to God for you for all the gladness _and_ delight which we enjoy for your sakes before our God? 













###### 10 






[And we] continue to pray especially _and_ with most intense earnestness night and day that we may see you face to face and mend _and_ make good whatever may be imperfect _and_ lacking in your faith. 













###### 11 






Now may our God and Father Himself and our Lord Jesus _Christ (the Messiah)_ guide our steps to you. 













###### 12 






And may the Lord make you to increase and excel _and_ overflow in love for one another and for all people, just as we also do for you, 













###### 13 






So that He may strengthen _and_ confirm _and_ establish your hearts faultlessly pure _and_ unblamable in holiness in the sight of our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus _Christ (the Messiah)_ with all His saints (the [^b]holy and glorified people of God)! _Amen, (so be it)!_

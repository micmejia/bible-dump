# 1 Timothy 1

***


###### 1 


Paul, an apostle (special messenger) of Christ Jesus by appointment _and_ command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus (the Messiah), our Hope, 


###### 2 


To Timothy, my true son in the faith: Grace (spiritual blessing and favor), mercy, and [heart] peace [be yours] from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. 


###### 3 


As I urged you when I was on my way to Macedonia, stay on where you are at Ephesus in order that you may warn _and_ admonish _and_ charge certain individuals not to teach any different doctrine, 


###### 4 


Nor to give importance to _or_ occupy themselves with legends (fables, myths) and endless genealogies, which foster _and_ promote useless speculations _and_ questionings rather than acceptance in faith of God's administration _and_ the divine training that is in faith (in that leaning of the entire human personality on God in absolute trust and confidence)-- 


###### 5 


Whereas the object _and_ purpose of our instruction _and_ charge is love, which springs from a pure heart and a good (clear) conscience and sincere (unfeigned) faith. 


###### 6 


But certain individuals have missed the mark on this very matter [and] have wandered away into vain arguments _and_ discussions _and_ purposeless talk. 


###### 7 


They are ambitious to be doctors of the Law (teachers of the Mosaic ritual), but they have no understanding either of the words _and_ terms they use or of the subjects about which they make [such] dogmatic assertions. 


###### 8 


Now we recognize _and_ know that the Law is good if anyone uses it lawfully [for the purpose for which it was designed], 


###### 9 


Knowing _and_ understanding this: that the Law is not enacted for the righteous (the upright and just, who are in right standing with God), but for the lawless and unruly, for the ungodly and sinful, for the irreverent and profane, for those who strike _and_ beat _and_ [even] murder fathers and strike _and_ beat _and_ [even] murder mothers, for manslayers, 


###### 10 


[For] impure _and_ immoral persons, those who abuse themselves with men, kidnapers, liars, perjurers--and whatever else is opposed to wholesome teaching _and_ sound doctrine 


###### 11 


As laid down by the glorious Gospel of the blessed God, with which I have been entrusted. 


###### 12 


I give thanks to Him Who has granted me [the needed] strength _and_ made me able [for this], Christ Jesus our Lord, because He has judged _and_ counted me faithful _and_ trustworthy, appointing me to [this stewardship of] the ministry. 


###### 13 


Though I formerly blasphemed and persecuted and was shamefully _and_ outrageously _and_ aggressively insulting [to Him], nevertheless, I obtained mercy because I had acted out of ignorance in unbelief. 


###### 14 


And the grace (unmerited favor and blessing) of our Lord [actually] flowed out superabundantly _and_ beyond measure for me, accompanied by faith and love that are [to be realized] in Christ Jesus. 


###### 15 


The saying is sure _and_ true and worthy of full _and_ universal acceptance, that Christ Jesus (the Messiah) came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am foremost. 


###### 16 


But I obtained mercy for the reason that in me, as the foremost [of sinners], Jesus Christ might show forth _and_ display all His perfect long-suffering _and_ patience for an example to [encourage] those who would thereafter believe on Him for [the gaining of] eternal life. 


###### 17 


Now to the King of eternity, incorruptible _and_ immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever (to the ages of ages). Amen (so be it). 


###### 18 


This charge _and_ admonition I commit in trust to you, Timothy, my son, in accordance with prophetic intimations which I formerly received concerning you, so that inspired _and_ aided by them you may wage the good warfare, 


###### 19 


Holding fast to faith (that leaning of the entire human personality on God in absolute trust and confidence) and having a good (clear) conscience. By rejecting _and_ thrusting from them [their conscience], some individuals have made shipwreck of their faith. 


###### 20 


Among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have delivered to Satan in order that they may be disciplined [by punishment and learn] not to blaspheme.

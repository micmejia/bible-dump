# 1 Timothy 2

***














###### 1 






First of all, then, I admonish _and_ urge that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be offered on behalf of all men, 













###### 2 






For kings and all who are in positions of authority _or_ high responsibility, that [outwardly] we may pass a quiet _and_ undisturbed life [and inwardly] a peaceable one in all godliness _and_ reverence and seriousness in every way. 













###### 3 






For such [praying] is good _and_ right, and [it is] pleasing _and_ acceptable to God our Savior, 













###### 4 






Who wishes all men to be saved and [increasingly] to perceive _and_ recognize _and_ discern _and_ know precisely _and_ correctly the [divine] Truth. 













###### 5 






For there [is only] one God, and [only] one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus, 













###### 6 






Who gave Himself as a ransom for all [people, a fact that was] attested to at the right _and_ proper time. 













###### 7 






And of this matter I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (special messenger)--I am speaking the truth _in Christ_, I do not falsify [when I say this]--a teacher of the Gentiles in [the realm of] faith and truth. 













###### 8 






I desire therefore that in every place men should pray, without anger _or_ quarreling _or_ resentment or doubt [in their minds], lifting up holy hands. 













###### 9 






Also [I desire] that women should adorn themselves modestly _and_ appropriately and sensibly in seemly apparel, not with [elaborate] hair arrangement or gold or pearls or expensive clothing, 













###### 10 






But by doing good deeds (deeds in themselves good and for the good and advantage of those contacted by them), as befits women who profess reverential fear for _and_ devotion to God. 













###### 11 






Let a woman learn in quietness, in entire submissiveness. 













###### 12 






I allow no woman to teach or to have authority over men; she is to remain in quietness _and_ keep silence [in religious assemblies]. 













###### 13 






For Adam was first formed, then Eve; 













###### 14 






And it was not Adam who was deceived, but [the] woman who was deceived _and_ deluded and fell into transgression. 













###### 15 






Nevertheless [the sentence put upon women of pain in motherhood does not hinder their souls' salvation, and] they will be saved [eternally] if they continue in faith and love and holiness with self-control, [saved indeed] through the Childbearing _or_ by the birth of the divine Child.

# 1 Timothy 4

***


###### 1 


But the [Holy] Spirit distinctly _and_ expressly declares that in latter times some will turn away from the faith, giving attention to deluding _and_ seducing spirits and doctrines that demons teach, 


###### 2 


Through the hypocrisy _and_ pretensions of liars whose consciences are seared (cauterized), 


###### 3 


Who forbid people to marry and [teach them] to abstain from [certain kinds of] foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe _and_ have [an increasingly clear] knowledge of the truth. 


###### 4 


For everything God has created is good, and nothing is to be thrown away _or_ refused if it is received with thanksgiving. 


###### 5 


For it is hallowed _and_ consecrated by the Word of God and by prayer. 


###### 6 


If you lay all these instructions before the brethren, you will be a worthy steward _and_ a good minister of Christ Jesus, ever nourishing your own self on the truths of the faith and of the good [Christian] instruction which you have closely followed. 


###### 7 


But refuse _and_ avoid irreverent legends (profane and impure and godless fictions, mere grandmothers' tales) and silly myths, _and_ express your disapproval of them. Train yourself toward godliness (piety), [keeping yourself spiritually fit]. 


###### 8 


For physical training is of some value (useful for a little), but godliness (spiritual training) is useful _and_ of value in everything _and_ in every way, for it holds promise for the present life and also for the life which is to come. 


###### 9 


This saying is reliable _and_ worthy of complete acceptance by everybody. 


###### 10 


With a view to this we toil and strive, [yes and] _suffer reproach_, because we have [fixed our] hope on the living God, Who is the Savior (Preserver, Maintainer, Deliverer) of all men, especially of those who believe (trust in, rely on, and adhere to Him). 


###### 11 


Continue to command these things and to teach them. 


###### 12 


Let no one despise _or_ think less of you because of your youth, but be an example (pattern) for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, and in purity. 


###### 13 


Till I come, devote yourself to [public and private] reading, to exhortation (preaching and personal appeals), and to teaching _and_ instilling doctrine. 


###### 14 


Do not neglect the gift which is in you, [that special inward endowment] which was directly imparted to you [by the Holy Spirit] by prophetic utterance when the elders laid their hands upon you [at your ordination]. 


###### 15 


Practice _and_ cultivate _and_ meditate upon these duties; throw yourself wholly into them [as your ministry], so that your progress may be evident to everybody. 


###### 16 


Look well to yourself [to your own personality] and to [your] teaching; persevere in these things [hold to them], for by so doing you will save both yourself and those who hear you.

# 2 Corinthians 1

***














###### 1 






Paul, an apostle (a special messenger) of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy [our] brother, to the church (assembly) of God which is at Corinth, and to all the saints (the people of God) throughout Achaia (most of Greece): 













###### 2 






Grace (favor and spiritual blessing) to you and [heart] peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One). 













###### 3 






Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of sympathy (pity and mercy) and the God [Who is the Source] of every comfort (consolation and encouragement), 













###### 4 






Who comforts (consoles and encourages) us in every trouble (calamity and affliction), so that we may also be able to comfort (console and encourage) those who are in any kind of trouble _or_ distress, with the comfort (consolation and encouragement) with which we ourselves are comforted (consoled and encouraged) by God. 













###### 5 






For just as Christ's [[^a]own] sufferings fall to our lot [^b][as they overflow upon His disciples, and we share and experience them] abundantly, so through Christ comfort (consolation and encouragement) is also [shared and experienced] abundantly by us. 













###### 6 






But if we are troubled (afflicted and distressed), it is for your comfort (consolation and encouragement) and [for your] salvation; and if we are comforted (consoled and encouraged), it is for your comfort (consolation and encouragement), which works [in you] when you patiently endure the same evils (misfortunes and calamities) that we also suffer _and_ undergo. 













###### 7 






And our hope for you [our joyful and confident expectation of good for you] is ever unwavering (assured and unshaken); for we know that just as you share _and_ are partners in [our] sufferings _and_ calamities, you also share _and_ are partners in [our] comfort (consolation and encouragement). 













###### 8 






For we do not want you to be uninformed, brethren, about the affliction _and_ oppressing distress which befell us in [the province of] Asia, how we were so utterly and unbearably weighed down _and_ crushed that we despaired even of life [itself]. 













###### 9 






Indeed, we felt within ourselves that we had received the [very] sentence of death, but that was to keep us from trusting in _and_ depending on ourselves instead of on God Who raises the dead. 













###### 10 






[For it is He] Who rescued _and_ saved us from such a perilous death, and He will still rescue _and_ save us; in _and_ on Him we have set our hope (our joyful and confident expectation) that He will again deliver us [from danger and destruction and [^c]draw us to Himself], 













###### 11 






While you also cooperate by your prayers for us [helping and laboring together with us]. Thus [the lips of] many persons [turned toward God will eventually] give thanks on our behalf for the grace (the blessing of deliverance) granted us at the request of the many who have prayed. 













###### 12 






It is a reason for pride _and_ exultation to which our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world [generally] and especially toward you, with devout _and_ pure motives and godly sincerity, not in fleshly wisdom but by the grace of God (the unmerited favor and [^d]merciful kindness by which God, exerting His holy influence upon souls, turns them to Christ, and keeps, strengthens, and increases them in Christian virtues). 













###### 13 






For we write you nothing else but simply what you can read and understand [there is no double meaning to what we say], and I hope that you will become thoroughly acquainted [with [^e]divine things] _and_ know _and_ understand [them] accurately _and_ well to the end, 













###### 14 






[Just] as you have [already] partially known _and_ understood _and_ acknowledged us _and_ recognized that you can [honestly] be proud of us, even as we [can be proud] of you on the day of our Lord Jesus. 













###### 15 






It was with assurance of this that I wanted _and_ planned to visit you first [of all], so that you might have a double favor _and_ token of grace (goodwill). 













###### 16 






[I wanted] to visit you on my way to Macedonia, and [then] to come again to you [on my return trip] from Macedonia and have you send me forward on my way to Judea. 













###### 17 






Now because I changed my original plan, was I being unstable _and_ capricious? Or what I plan, do I plan according to the flesh [like a worldly man], ready to say Yes, yes, [when it may mean] No, no? 













###### 18 






As surely as God is trustworthy _and_ faithful _and_ means what He says, our speech _and_ message to you have not been Yes [that might mean] No. 













###### 19 






For the Son of God, Christ Jesus (the Messiah), Who has been preached among you by us, by myself, Silvanus, and Timothy, was not Yes and No; but in Him it is [always the divine] Yes. 













###### 20 






For as many as are the promises of God, they all find their Yes [answer] in Him [Christ]. For this reason we also utter the Amen (so be it) to God through Him [in His Person and by His agency] to the glory of God. 













###### 21 






But it is God Who confirms _and_ makes us steadfast _and_ establishes us [in joint fellowship] with you in Christ, and has consecrated _and_ anointed us [[^f]enduing us with the gifts of the Holy Spirit]; 













###### 22 






[He has also appropriated and acknowledged us as His by] putting His seal upon us and giving us His [Holy] Spirit in our hearts as the security deposit _and_ guarantee [of the fulfillment of His promise]. 













###### 23 






But I call upon God as my soul's witness: it was to avoid hurting you that I refrained from coming to Corinth-- 













###### 24 






Not that we have dominion [over you] _and_ lord it over your faith, but [rather that we work with you as] fellow laborers [to promote] your joy, for in [your] faith ([^g]in your strong and welcome conviction or belief that Jesus is the Messiah, through Whom we obtain eternal salvation in the kingdom of God) you stand firm.

# 2 Corinthians 2

***














###### 1 






But I definitely made up my mind not to grieve you with another painful _and_ distressing visit. 













###### 2 






For if I cause you pain [with merited rebuke], who is there to provide me enjoyment but the [very] one whom I have grieved _and_ made sad? 













###### 3 






And I wrote the same to you so that when I came, I might not be myself pained by those who are the [very] ones who ought to make me glad, for I trusted in you all _and_ felt confident that my joy would be shared by all of you. 













###### 4 






For I wrote you out of great sorrow and deep distress [with mental torture and anxiety] of heart, [yes, and] with many tears, not to cause you pain but in order to make you realize the overflowing love that I continue increasingly to have for you. 













###### 5 






But if someone [the one among you who committed incest] has caused [all this] grief _and_ pain, he has caused it not to me, but in some measure, not to put it too severely, [he has distressed] all of you. 













###### 6 






For such a one this censure by the majority [which he has received is] sufficient [punishment]. 













###### 7 






So [instead of further rebuke, now] you should rather turn _and_ [graciously] forgive and comfort _and_ encourage [him], to keep him from being overwhelmed by excessive sorrow _and_ despair. 













###### 8 






I therefore beg you to reinstate him in your affections _and_ assure him of your love for him; 













###### 9 






For this was my purpose in writing you, to test your attitude _and_ see if you would stand the test, whether you are obedient _and_ altogether agreeable [to following my orders] in everything. 













###### 10 






If you forgive anyone anything, I too forgive that one; and what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, has been for your sakes in the presence [and with the approval] of Christ (the Messiah), 













###### 11 






To keep Satan from getting the advantage over us; for we are not ignorant of his wiles _and_ intentions. 













###### 12 






Now when I arrived at Troas [to preach] the good news (the Gospel) of Christ, a door of opportunity was opened for me in the Lord, 













###### 13 






Yet my spirit could not rest (relax, get relief) because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I took leave from them _and_ departed for Macedonia. 













###### 14 






But thanks be to God, Who in Christ always leads us in triumph [as trophies of Christ's victory] and through us spreads _and_ makes evident the fragrance of the knowledge of God everywhere, 













###### 15 






For we are the sweet fragrance of Christ [which exhales] unto God, [discernible alike] among those who are being saved _and_ among those who are perishing: 













###### 16 






To the latter it is an aroma [wafted] from death to death [a fatal odor, the smell of doom]; to the former it is an aroma from life to life [a vital fragrance, living and fresh]. And who is qualified (fit and sufficient) for these things? [Who is able for such a ministry? We?] 













###### 17 






For we are not, like so many, [like hucksters making a trade of] peddling God's Word [shortchanging and adulterating the divine message]; but like [men] of sincerity _and_ the purest motive, as [commissioned and sent] by God, we speak [His message] in Christ (the Messiah), in the [very] sight _and_ presence of God.

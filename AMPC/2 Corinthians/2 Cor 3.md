# 2 Corinthians 3

***














###### 1 






Are we starting to commend ourselves again? Or we do not, like some [false teachers], need written credentials _or_ letters of recommendation to you or from you, [do we]? 













###### 2 






[No] you yourselves are our letter of recommendation (our credentials), written in [^a]your hearts, to be known (perceived, recognized) and read by everybody. 













###### 3 






You show _and_ make obvious that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us, not written with ink but with [the] Spirit of [the] living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts. 













###### 4 






Such is the reliance _and_ confidence that we have through Christ toward _and_ with reference to God. 













###### 5 






Not that we are fit (qualified and sufficient in ability) of ourselves to form personal judgments _or_ to claim _or_ count anything as coming from us, but our power _and_ ability _and_ sufficiency are from God. 













###### 6 






[It is He] Who has qualified us [making us to be fit and worthy and sufficient] as ministers _and_ dispensers of a new covenant [of salvation through Christ], not [ministers] of the letter (of legally written code) but of the Spirit; for the code [of the Law] kills, but the [Holy] Spirit makes alive. 













###### 7 






Now if the dispensation of death engraved in letters on stone [the ministration of the Law], was inaugurated with such glory _and_ splendor that the Israelites were not able to look steadily at the face of Moses because of its brilliance, [a glory] that was to fade _and_ pass away, 













###### 8 






Why should not the dispensation of the Spirit [this spiritual [^b]ministry whose task it is to cause men to obtain and be governed by the Holy Spirit] be attended with much greater _and_ more splendid glory? 













###### 9 






For if the service that condemns [the ministration of doom] had glory, how infinitely more abounding in splendor _and_ glory must be the service that makes righteous [the ministry that produces and fosters righteous living and right standing with God]! 













###### 10 






Indeed, in view of this fact, what once had splendor [[^c]the glory of the Law in the face of Moses] has come to have no splendor at all, because of the overwhelming glory that exceeds _and_ excels it [[^d]the glory of the Gospel in the face of Jesus Christ]. 













###### 11 






For if that which was but passing _and_ fading away came with splendor, how much more must that which remains _and_ is permanent abide in glory _and_ splendor! 













###### 12 






Since we have such [glorious] hope (such joyful and confident expectation), we speak very freely _and_ openly _and_ fearlessly. 













###### 13 






Nor [do we act] like Moses, who put a veil over his face so that the Israelites might not gaze upon the finish of the vanishing [splendor which had been upon it]. 













###### 14 






In fact, their minds were grown hard _and_ calloused [they had become dull and had lost the power of understanding]; for until this present day, when the Old Testament (the old covenant) is being read, that same veil still lies [on their hearts], not being lifted [to reveal] that in Christ it is made void _and_ done away. 













###### 15 






Yes, down to this [very] day whenever Moses is read, a veil lies upon their minds _and_ hearts. 













###### 16 






But whenever a person turns [in repentance] to the Lord, the veil is stripped off _and_ taken away. 













###### 17 






Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty (emancipation from bondage, freedom). 













###### 18 






And all of us, as with unveiled face, [because we] continued to behold [in the Word of God] as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are constantly being transfigured into His _very own_ image in ever increasing splendor _and_ from one degree of glory to another; [for this comes] from the Lord [Who is] the Spirit.

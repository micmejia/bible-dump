# 2 Corinthians 4

***














###### 1 






Therefore, since we do hold _and_ engage in this ministry by the mercy of God [granting us favor, benefits, opportunities, and especially salvation], we do not get discouraged (spiritless and despondent with fear) _or_ become faint with weariness and exhaustion. 













###### 2 






We have renounced disgraceful ways (secret thoughts, feelings, desires and underhandedness, the methods and arts that men hide through shame); we refuse to deal craftily (to practice trickery and cunning) or to adulterate _or_ handle dishonestly the Word of God, but we state the truth openly (clearly and candidly). And so we commend ourselves in the sight _and_ presence of God to every man's conscience. 













###### 3 






But even if our Gospel (the glad tidings) also be hidden (obscured and covered up with a veil that hinders the knowledge of God), it is hidden [only] to those who are perishing _and_ obscured [only] to those who are spiritually dying _and_ veiled [only] to those who are lost. 













###### 4 






For the god of this world has blinded the unbelievers' minds [that they should not discern the truth], preventing them from seeing the illuminating light of the Gospel of the glory of Christ (the Messiah), Who is the Image _and_ Likeness of God. 













###### 5 






For what we preach is not ourselves but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves [merely] as your servants (slaves) for Jesus' sake. 













###### 6 






For God Who said, Let light shine out of darkness, has shone in our hearts so as [to beam forth] the Light for the illumination of the knowledge of the majesty _and_ glory of God [as it is manifest in the Person and is revealed] in the face of _Jesus_ Christ (the Messiah). 













###### 7 






However, we possess this precious treasure [the divine Light of the Gospel] in [frail, human] vessels of earth, that the grandeur _and_ exceeding greatness of the power may be shown to be from God and not from ourselves. 













###### 8 






We are hedged in (pressed) on every side [troubled and oppressed in every way], but not cramped _or_ crushed; we suffer embarrassments _and_ are perplexed _and_ unable to find a way out, but not driven to despair; 













###### 9 






We are pursued (persecuted and hard driven), but not deserted [to stand alone]; we are struck down to the ground, but never struck out _and_ destroyed; 













###### 10 






Always carrying about in the body the liability _and_ exposure to the same putting to death that _the Lord_ Jesus suffered, so that the [resurrection] life of Jesus also may be shown forth by _and_ in our bodies. 













###### 11 






For we who live are constantly [experiencing] being handed over to death for Jesus' sake, that the [resurrection] life of Jesus also may be evidenced through our flesh which is liable to death. 













###### 12 






Thus death is actively at work in us, but [it is in order that our] life [may be actively at work] in you. 













###### 13 






Yet we have the same spirit of faith as he had who wrote, I have believed, and therefore have I spoken. We too believe, and therefore we speak, 













###### 14 






Assured that He Who raised up the Lord Jesus will raise us up also with Jesus and bring us [along] with you into His presence. 













###### 15 






For all [these] things are [taking place] for your sake, so that the more grace (divine favor and spiritual blessing) extends to more and more people _and_ multiplies through the many, the more thanksgiving may increase [and redound] to the glory of God. 













###### 16 






Therefore we do not become discouraged (utterly spiritless, exhausted, and wearied out through fear). Though our outer man is [progressively] decaying _and_ wasting away, yet our inner self is being [progressively] renewed day after day. 













###### 17 






For our light, momentary affliction (this slight distress of the passing hour) is ever more and more abundantly preparing _and_ producing _and_ achieving for us an everlasting weight of glory [beyond all measure, excessively surpassing all comparisons and all calculations, a vast and transcendent glory and blessedness never to cease!], 













###### 18 






Since we consider _and_ look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen; for the things that are visible are temporal (brief and fleeting), but the things that are invisible are deathless _and_ everlasting.

# 2 Corinthians 7

***














###### 1 






Therefore, since these [great] promises are ours, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from everything that contaminates _and_ defiles body and spirit, and bring [our] consecration to completeness in the [reverential] fear of God. 













###### 2 






Do open your hearts to us again [enlarge them to take us in]. We have wronged no one, we have betrayed _or_ corrupted no one, we have cheated _or_ taken advantage of no one. 













###### 3 






I do not say this to reproach _or_ condemn [you], for I have said before that you are [nested] in our hearts, [and you will remain there] together [with us], whether we die or live. 













###### 4 






I have great boldness _and_ free _and_ fearless confidence _and_ cheerful courage toward you; my pride in you is great. I am filled [brimful] with the comfort [of it]; with all our tribulation _and_ in spite of it, [I am filled with comfort] I am overflowing with joy. 













###### 5 






For even when we arrived in Macedonia, our bodies had no ease _or_ rest, but we were oppressed in every way _and_ afflicted at every turn--fighting _and_ contentions without, dread _and_ fears within [us]. 













###### 6 






But God, Who comforts _and_ encourages _and_ refreshes _and_ cheers the depressed _and_ the sinking, comforted _and_ encouraged _and_ refreshed _and_ cheered us by the arrival of Titus. 













###### 7 






[Yes] and not only by his coming but also by [his account of] the comfort with which he was encouraged _and_ refreshed _and_ cheered as to you, while he told us of your yearning affection, of how sorry you were [for me] and how eagerly you took my part, so that I rejoiced still more. 













###### 8 






For even though I did grieve you with my letter, I do not regret [it now], though I did regret it; for I see that that letter did pain you, though only for a little while; 













###### 9 






Yet I am glad now, not because you were pained, but because you were pained into repentance [and so turned back to God]; for you felt a grief such as God meant you to feel, so that in nothing you might suffer loss through us _or_ harm for what we did. 













###### 10 






For godly grief _and_ the pain God is permitted to direct, produce a repentance that leads _and_ contributes to salvation _and_ deliverance from evil, and it never brings regret; but worldly grief (the hopeless sorrow that is characteristic of the pagan world) is deadly [breeding and ending in death]. 













###### 11 






For [you can look back now and] observe what this same godly sorrow has done for you _and_ has produced in you: what eagerness _and_ earnest care to explain _and_ clear yourselves [of all complicity in the condoning of incest], what indignation [at the sin], what alarm, what yearning, what zeal [to do justice to all concerned], what readiness to mete out punishment [to the offender]! At every point you have proved yourselves cleared _and_ guiltless in the matter. 













###### 12 






So although I did write to you [as I did], it was not for the sake _and_ because of the one who did [the] wrong, nor on account of the one who suffered [the] wrong, but in order that you might realize before God [that your readiness to accept our authority revealed] how zealously you do care for us. 













###### 13 






Therefore we are relieved _and_ comforted _and_ encouraged [at the result]. And in addition to our own [personal] consolation, we were especially delighted at the joy of Titus, because you have all set his mind at rest, soothing _and_ refreshing his spirit. 













###### 14 






For if I had boasted to him at all concerning you, I was not disappointed _or_ put to shame, but just as everything we ever said to you was true, so our boasting [about you] to Titus has proved true also. 













###### 15 






And his heart goes out to you more abundantly than ever as he recalls the submission [to his guidance] that all of you had, and the reverence _and_ anxiety [to meet all requirements] with which you accepted _and_ welcomed him. 













###### 16 






I am very happy because I now am of good courage _and_ have perfect confidence in you in all things.

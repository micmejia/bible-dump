# 2 Corinthians 9

***














###### 1 






Now about the offering that is [to be made] for the saints (God's people in Jerusalem), it is quite superfluous that I should write you; 













###### 2 






For I am well acquainted with your willingness (your readiness and your eagerness to promote it) and I have proudly told about you to the people of Macedonia, saying that Achaia (most of Greece) has been prepared since last year for this contribution; and [consequently] your enthusiasm has stimulated the majority of them. 













###### 3 






Still, I am sending the brethren [on to you], lest our pride in you should be made an empty boast in this particular case, and so that you may be all ready, as I told them you would be; 













###### 4 






Lest, if [any] Macedonians should come with me and find you unprepared [for this generosity], we, to say nothing of yourselves, be humiliated for our being so confident. 













###### 5 






That is why I thought it necessary to urge these brethren to go to you before I do and make arrangements in advance for this bountiful, promised gift of yours, so that it may be ready, not as an extortion [wrung out of you] but as a generous _and_ willing gift. 













###### 6 






[Remember] this: he who sows sparingly _and_ grudgingly will also reap sparingly _and_ grudgingly, and he who sows generously [[^a]that blessings may come to someone] will also reap generously _and_ with blessings. 













###### 7 






Let each one [give] as he has made up his own mind _and_ purposed in his heart, not reluctantly _or_ sorrowfully or under compulsion, for God loves (He [^b]takes pleasure in, prizes above other things, and is unwilling to abandon or to do without) a cheerful (joyous, "prompt to do it") giver [whose heart is in his giving]. 













###### 8 






And God is able to make all grace (every favor and [^c]earthly blessing) come to you in abundance, so that you may always _and_ under all circumstances _and_ whatever the need [^d]be self-sufficient [possessing enough to require no aid or support and furnished in abundance for every good work and charitable donation]. 













###### 9 






As it is written, He [the benevolent person] scatters abroad; He gives to the poor; His deeds of justice _and_ goodness _and_ kindness _and_ benevolence will go on _and_ endure forever! 













###### 10 






And [God] Who provides seed for the sower and bread for eating will also provide and multiply your [resources for] sowing and increase the fruits of your righteousness [[^e]which manifests itself in active goodness, kindness, and charity]. 













###### 11 






Thus you will be enriched in all things _and_ in every way, so that you can be generous, and [your generosity as it is] administered by us will bring forth thanksgiving to God. 













###### 12 






For the service that the ministering of this fund renders does not only fully supply what is lacking to the saints (God's people), but it also overflows in many [cries of] thanksgiving to God. 













###### 13 






Because at [your] standing of the test of this ministry, they will glorify God for your loyalty _and_ obedience to the Gospel of Christ which you confess, as well as for your generous-hearted liberality to them and to all [the other needy ones]. 













###### 14 






And they yearn for you while they pray for you, because of the surpassing measure of God's grace (His favor and mercy and spiritual blessing which is shown forth) in you. 













###### 15 






Now thanks be to God for His Gift, [precious] beyond telling [His indescribable, inexpressible, free Gift]! ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

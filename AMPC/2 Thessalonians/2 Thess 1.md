# 2 Thessalonians 1

***














###### 1 






Paul, Silvanus (Silas), and Timothy, to the church (assembly) of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One): 













###### 2 






Grace (unmerited favor) be to you and [heart] peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One). 













###### 3 






We ought _and_ indeed are obligated [as those in debt] to give thanks always to God for you, brethren, as is fitting, because your faith is growing exceedingly and the love of every one of you each toward the others is increasing _and_ abounds. 













###### 4 






And this is a cause of our mentioning you with pride among the churches (assemblies) of God for your steadfastness (your unflinching endurance and patience) and your firm faith in the midst of all the persecutions and crushing distresses _and_ afflictions under which you are holding up. 













###### 5 






This is positive proof of the just _and_ right judgment of God to the end that you may be deemed deserving of His kingdom [a plain token of His fair verdict which designs that you should be made _and_ counted worthy of the kingdom of God], for the sake of which you are also suffering. 













###### 6 






[It is a fair decision] since it is a righteous thing with God to repay with distress _and_ affliction those who distress _and_ afflict you, 













###### 7 






And to [[^a]recompense] you who are so distressed _and_ afflicted [by granting you] relief _and_ rest along with us [your fellow sufferers] when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with His mighty angels in a flame of fire, 













###### 8 






To deal out retribution (chastisement and vengeance) upon those who do not know _or_ perceive _or_ become acquainted with God, and [upon those] who ignore _and_ refuse to obey the Gospel of our Lord Jesus _Christ_. 













###### 9 






Such people will pay the penalty _and_ suffer the punishment of everlasting ruin (destruction and perdition) _and_ eternal exclusion and banishment from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power, 













###### 10 






When He comes to be glorified in His saints [on that day He will be made more glorious in His consecrated people], and [He will] be marveled at _and_ admired [in His glory reflected] in all who have believed [who have adhered to, trusted in, and relied on Him], because our witnessing among you was confidently accepted _and_ believed [and confirmed in your lives]. 













###### 11 






With this in view we constantly pray for you, that our God may deem _and_ count you worthy of [your] calling and [His] every gracious purpose of goodness, and with power may complete in [your] every particular work of faith (faith which is that [^b]leaning of the whole human personality on God in absolute trust and confidence in His power, wisdom, and goodness). 













###### 12 






Thus may the name of our Lord Jesus _Christ_ be glorified _and_ become more glorious through _and_ in you, and may you [also be glorified] in Him according to the grace (favor and blessing) of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One).

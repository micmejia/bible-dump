# 2 Thessalonians 3

***














###### 1 






Furthermore, brethren, do pray for us, that the Word of the Lord may speed on (spread rapidly and run its course) and be glorified (extolled) _and_ triumph, even as [it has done] with you, 













###### 2 






And that we may be delivered from perverse (improper, unrighteous) and wicked (actively malicious) men, for not everybody has faith _and_ is held by it. 













###### 3 






Yet the Lord is faithful, and He will strengthen [you] _and_ set you on a firm foundation and guard you from the evil [one]. 













###### 4 






And we have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that you are doing and will continue to do the things which we suggest _and_ with which we charge you. 













###### 5 






May the Lord direct your hearts into [realizing and showing] the love of God and into the steadfastness _and_ patience of Christ _and_ [^a]in waiting for His return. 













###### 6 






Now we charge you, brethren, in the name _and_ on the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) that you withdraw _and_ keep away from every brother (fellow believer) who is slack in the performance of duty _and_ is disorderly, living as a shirker _and_ not walking in accord with the traditions _and_ instructions that you have received from us. 













###### 7 






For you yourselves know how it is necessary to imitate our example, for we were not disorderly _or_ shirking of duty when we were with you [we were not idle]. 













###### 8 






Nor did we eat anyone's bread without paying for it, but with toil and struggle we worked night and day, that we might not be a burden _or_ impose on any of you [for our support]. 













###### 9 






[It was] not because we do not have a right [to such support], but [we wished] to make ourselves an example for you to follow. 













###### 10 






For while we were yet with you, we gave you this rule _and_ charge: If anyone will not work, neither let him eat. 













###### 11 






Indeed, we hear that some among you are disorderly [that they are passing their lives in idleness, neglectful of duty], being busy with other people's affairs instead of their own and doing no work. 













###### 12 






Now we charge and exhort such persons [as [^b]ministers in Him exhorting those] in the Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) that they work in quietness and earn their own food _and_ other necessities. 













###### 13 






And as for you, brethren, do not become weary _or_ lose heart in doing right [but continue in well-doing without weakening]. 













###### 14 






But if anyone [in the church] refuses to obey what we say in this letter, take note of that person and do not associate with him, so that he may be ashamed. 













###### 15 






Do not regard him as an enemy, but simply admonish _and_ warn him as [being still] a brother. 













###### 16 






Now may the Lord of peace Himself grant you His peace (the peace of His kingdom) at all times and in all ways [under all circumstances and conditions, whatever comes]. The Lord [be] with you all. 













###### 17 






I, Paul, write you this final greeting with my own hand. This is the mark _and_ sign [that it is not a forgery] in every letter of mine. It is the way I write [my handwriting and signature]. 













###### 18 






The grace (spiritual blessing and favor) of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) be with you all. _Amen (so be it)._

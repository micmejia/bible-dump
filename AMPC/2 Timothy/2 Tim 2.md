# 2 Timothy 2

***














###### 1 






So you, my son, be strong (strengthened inwardly) in the grace (spiritual blessing) that is [to be found only] in Christ Jesus. 













###### 2 






And the [instructions] which you have heard from me along with many witnesses, transmit _and_ entrust [as a deposit] to reliable _and_ faithful men who will be competent _and_ qualified to teach others also. 













###### 3 






Take [with me] your share of the hardships _and_ suffering [which you are called to endure] as a good (first-class) soldier of Christ Jesus. 













###### 4 






No soldier when in service gets entangled in the enterprises of [civilian] life; his aim is to satisfy _and_ please the one who enlisted him. 













###### 5 






And if anyone enters competitive games, he is not crowned unless he competes lawfully (fairly, according to the rules laid down). 













###### 6 






[It is] the hard-working farmer [who labors to produce] who must be the first partaker of the fruits. 













###### 7 






Think over these things I am saying [understand them and grasp their application], for the Lord will grant you full insight _and_ understanding in everything. 













###### 8 






Constantly keep in mind Jesus Christ (the Messiah) [as] risen from the dead, [as the prophesied King] descended from David, according to the good news (the Gospel) that I preach. 













###### 9 






For that [Gospel] I am suffering affliction _and_ even wearing chains like a criminal. But the Word of God is not chained _or_ imprisoned! 













###### 10 






Therefore I [am ready to] persevere _and_ stand my ground with patience _and_ endure everything for the sake of the elect [God's chosen], so that they too may obtain [the] salvation which is in Christ Jesus, with [the reward of] eternal glory. 













###### 11 






The saying is sure _and_ worthy of confidence: If we have died with Him, we shall also live with Him. 













###### 12 






If we endure, we shall also reign with Him. If we deny _and_ disown _and_ reject Him, He will also deny _and_ disown _and_ reject us. 













###### 13 






If we are faithless [do not believe and are untrue to Him], He remains true (faithful to His Word and His righteous character), for He cannot deny Himself. 













###### 14 






Remind [the people] of these facts and [solemnly] charge them in the presence of the Lord to avoid petty controversy over words, which does no good but upsets _and_ undermines the faith of the hearers. 













###### 15 






Study _and_ be eager _and_ do your utmost to present yourself to God approved (tested by trial), a workman who has no cause to be ashamed, correctly analyzing _and_ accurately dividing [rightly handling and skillfully teaching] the Word of Truth. 













###### 16 






But avoid all empty (vain, useless, idle) talk, for it will lead people into more _and_ more ungodliness. 













###### 17 






And their teaching [will devour; it] will eat its way like cancer _or_ spread like gangrene. So it is with Hymenaeus and Philetus, 













###### 18 






Who have missed the mark _and_ swerved from the truth by arguing that the resurrection has already taken place. They are undermining the faith of some. 













###### 19 






But the firm foundation of (laid by) God stands, sure _and_ unshaken, bearing this seal (inscription): The Lord knows those who are His, and, Let everyone who names [himself by] the name of the Lord give up all iniquity _and_ stand aloof from it. 













###### 20 






But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also [utensils] of wood and earthenware, and some for honorable _and_ noble [use] and some for menial _and_ ignoble [use]. 













###### 21 






So whoever cleanses himself [from what is ignoble _and_ unclean, who separates himself from contact with contaminating and corrupting influences] will [then himself] be a vessel set apart _and_ useful for honorable _and_ noble purposes, consecrated _and_ profitable to the Master, fit _and_ ready for any good work. 













###### 22 






Shun youthful lusts _and_ flee from them, and aim at _and_ pursue righteousness (all that is virtuous and good, right living, conformity to the will of God in thought, word, and deed); [and aim at and pursue] faith, love, [and] peace (harmony and concord with others) in fellowship with all [Christians], who call upon the Lord out of a pure heart. 













###### 23 






But refuse (shut your mind against, have nothing to do with) trifling (ill-informed, unedifying, stupid) controversies over ignorant questionings, for you know that they foster strife _and_ breed quarrels. 













###### 24 






And the servant of the Lord must not be quarrelsome (fighting and contending). Instead, he must be kindly to everyone _and_ mild-tempered [preserving the bond of peace]; he must be a skilled _and_ suitable teacher, patient _and_ forbearing _and_ willing to suffer wrong. 













###### 25 






He must correct his opponents with courtesy _and_ gentleness, in the hope that God may grant that they will repent and come to know the Truth [that they will perceive and recognize and become accurately acquainted with and acknowledge it], 













###### 26 






And that they may come to their senses [and] escape out of the snare of the devil, having been held captive by him, [henceforth] to do His [God's] will.

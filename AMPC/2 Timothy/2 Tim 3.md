# 2 Timothy 3

***


###### 1 


But understand this, that in the last days will come (set in) perilous times of great stress _and_ trouble [hard to deal with and hard to bear]. 


###### 2 


For people will be lovers of self _and_ [utterly] self-centered, lovers of money _and_ aroused by an inordinate [greedy] desire for wealth, proud _and_ arrogant _and_ contemptuous boasters. They will be abusive (blasphemous, scoffing), disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy _and_ profane. 


###### 3 


[They will be] without natural [human] affection (callous and inhuman), relentless (admitting of no truce or appeasement); [they will be] slanderers (false accusers, troublemakers), intemperate _and_ loose in morals _and_ conduct, uncontrolled _and_ fierce, haters of good. 


###### 4 


[They will be] treacherous [betrayers], rash, [and] inflated with self-conceit. [They will be] lovers of sensual pleasures _and_ vain amusements more than _and_ rather than lovers of God. 


###### 5 


For [although] they hold a form of piety (true religion), they deny _and_ reject _and_ are strangers to the power of it [their conduct belies the genuineness of their profession]. Avoid [all] such people [turn away from them]. 


###### 6 


For among them are those who worm their way into homes and captivate silly _and_ weak-natured _and_ spiritually dwarfed women, loaded down with [the burden of their] sins [and easily] swayed _and_ led away by various evil desires _and_ seductive impulses. 


###### 7 


[These weak women will listen to anybody who will teach them]; they are forever inquiring _and_ getting information, but are never able to arrive at a recognition _and_ knowledge of the Truth. 


###### 8 


Now just as Jannes and Jambres were hostile to _and_ resisted Moses, so these men also are hostile to _and_ oppose the Truth. They have depraved _and_ distorted minds, and are reprobate _and_ counterfeit _and_ to be rejected as far as the faith is concerned. 


###### 9 


But they will not get very far, for their rash folly will become obvious to everybody, as was that of those [magicians mentioned]. 


###### 10 


Now you have closely observed _and_ diligently followed my teaching, conduct, purpose in life, faith, patience, love, steadfastness, 


###### 11 


Persecutions, sufferings--such as occurred to me at Antioch, at Iconium, and at Lystra, persecutions I endured, but out of them all the Lord delivered me. 


###### 12 


Indeed all who delight in piety _and_ are determined to live a devoted _and_ godly life in Christ Jesus will meet with persecution [will be made to suffer because of their religious stand]. 


###### 13 


But wicked men and imposters will go on from bad to worse, deceiving _and_ leading astray others and being deceived _and_ led astray themselves. 


###### 14 


But as for you, continue to hold to the things that you have learned and of which you are convinced, knowing from whom you learned [them], 


###### 15 


And how from your childhood you have had a knowledge of _and_ been acquainted with the sacred Writings, which are able to instruct you _and_ give you the understanding for salvation which comes through faith in Christ Jesus [through the leaning of the entire human personality on God in Christ Jesus in absolute trust and confidence in His power, wisdom, and goodness]. 


###### 16 


Every Scripture is God-breathed (given by His inspiration) and profitable for instruction, for reproof _and_ conviction of sin, for correction of error _and_ discipline in obedience, [and] for training in righteousness (in holy living, in conformity to God's will in thought, purpose, and action), 


###### 17 


So that the man of God may be complete _and_ proficient, well fitted _and_ thoroughly equipped for every good work.

# 2 Timothy 4

***














###### 1 






I charge [you] in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, Who is to judge the living and the dead, and by (in the light of) His coming and His kingdom: 













###### 2 






Herald _and_ preach the Word! Keep your sense of urgency [stand by, be at hand and ready], whether the opportunity seems to be favorable or unfavorable. [Whether it is convenient or inconvenient, whether it is welcome or unwelcome, you as preacher of the Word are to show people in what way their lives are wrong.] And convince them, rebuking _and_ correcting, warning _and_ urging _and_ encouraging them, being unflagging _and_ inexhaustible in patience and teaching. 













###### 3 






For the time is coming when [people] will not tolerate (endure) sound _and_ wholesome instruction, but, having ears itching [for something pleasing and gratifying], they will gather to themselves one teacher after another to a considerable number, chosen to satisfy their own liking _and_ to foster the errors they hold, 













###### 4 






And will turn aside from hearing the truth and wander off into myths _and_ man-made fictions. 













###### 5 






As for you, be calm _and_ cool _and_ steady, accept _and_ suffer unflinchingly every hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fully perform all the duties of your ministry. 













###### 6 






For I am already about to be sacrificed [my life is about to be poured out as a drink offering]; the time of my [spirit's] release [from the body] is at hand _and_ I will soon go free. 













###### 7 






I have fought the good (worthy, honorable, and noble) fight, I have finished the race, I have kept (firmly held) the faith. 













###### 8 






[As to what remains] henceforth there is laid up for me the [victor's] crown of righteousness [for being right with God and doing right], which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me _and_ recompense me on that [great] day--and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved _and_ yearned for _and_ welcomed His appearing (His return). 













###### 9 






Make every effort to come to me soon. 













###### 10 






For Demas has deserted me for love of this present world and has gone to Thessalonica; Crescens [has gone] to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia. 













###### 11 






Luke alone is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, for he is very helpful to me for the ministry. 













###### 12 






Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus. 













###### 13 






[When] you come, bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, also the books, especially the parchments. 













###### 14 






Alexander the coppersmith did me great wrongs. The Lord will pay him back for his actions. 













###### 15 






Beware of him yourself, for he opposed _and_ resisted our message very strongly _and_ exceedingly. 













###### 16 






At my first trial no one acted in my defense [as my advocate] _or_ took my part _or_ [even] stood with me, but all forsook me. May it not be charged against them! 













###### 17 






But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, so that through me the [Gospel] message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. So I was delivered out of the jaws of the lion. 













###### 18 






[And indeed] the Lord will certainly deliver _and_ draw me to Himself from every assault of evil. He will preserve _and_ bring me safe unto His heavenly kingdom. To Him be the glory forever and ever. Amen (so be it). 













###### 19 






Give my greetings to Prisca and Aquila and to the household of Onesiphorus. 













###### 20 






Erastus stayed on at Corinth, but Trophimus I left ill at Miletus. 













###### 21 






Do hasten _and_ try your best to come to me before winter. Eubulus wishes to be remembered to you, as do Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brethren. 













###### 22 






The Lord _Jesus Christ_ be with your spirit. Grace (God's favor and blessing) be with you. _Amen (so be it)._

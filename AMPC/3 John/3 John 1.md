# 3 John 1

***














###### 1 






The elderly elder [of the church addresses this letter] to the beloved (esteemed) Gaius, whom I truly love. 













###### 2 






Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in every way and [that your body] may keep well, even as [I know] your soul keeps well _and_ prospers. 













###### 3 






In fact, I greatly rejoiced when [some of] the brethren from time to time arrived and spoke [so highly] of the sincerity _and_ fidelity of your life, as indeed you do live in the Truth [the whole Gospel presents]. 













###### 4 






I have no greater joy than this, to hear that my [spiritual] children are living their lives in the Truth. 













###### 5 






Beloved, it is a fine _and_ faithful work that you are doing when you give any service to the [Christian] brethren, and [especially when they are] strangers. 













###### 6 






They have testified before the church of your love _and_ friendship. You will do well to forward them on their journey [and you will please do so] in a way worthy of God's [service]. 













###### 7 






For these [traveling missionaries] have gone out for the Name's sake (for His sake) and are accepting nothing from the Gentiles (the heathen, the non-Israelites). 













###### 8 






So we ourselves ought to support such people [to welcome and provide for them], in order that we may be fellow workers in the Truth (the whole Gospel) _and_ cooperate with its teachers. 













###### 9 






I have written briefly to the church; but Diotrephes, who likes to take the lead among them _and_ put himself first, does not acknowledge my authority _and_ refuses to accept my suggestions _or_ to listen to me. 













###### 10 






So when I arrive, I will call attention to what he is doing, his boiling over _and_ casting malicious reflections upon us with insinuating language. And not satisfied with that, he refuses to receive _and_ welcome the [missionary] brethren himself, and also interferes with _and_ forbids those who would welcome them, and tries to expel (excommunicate) them from the church. 













###### 11 






Beloved, do not imitate evil, but imitate good. He who does good is of God; he who does evil has not seen (discerned or experienced) God [has enjoyed no vision of Him and does not know Him at all]. 













###### 12 






Demetrius has warm commendation from everyone--and from the Truth itself; we add our testimony also, and you know that our testimony is true. 













###### 13 






I had much [to say to you when I began] to write, but I prefer not to put it down with pen (a reed) and ink; 













###### 14 






I hope to see you soon, and we will talk together face to face. 













###### 15 






Peace be to you! (Good-bye!) The friends here send you greetings. Remember me to the friends there [to every one of them personally] by name.

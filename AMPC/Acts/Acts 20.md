# Acts 20

***














###### 1 






After the uproar had ceased, Paul sent for the disciples and warned _and_ consoled _and_ urged _and_ encouraged them; then he embraced them _and_ told them farewell and set forth on his journey to Macedonia. 













###### 2 






Then after he had gone through those districts and had warned _and_ consoled _and_ urged _and_ encouraged the brethren with much discourse, he came to Greece. 













###### 3 






Having spent three months there, when a plot was formed against him by the Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he resolved to go back through Macedonia. 













###### 4 






He was accompanied by Sopater the son of Pyrrhus from Beroea, and by the Thessalonians Aristarchus and Secundus, and Gaius of Derbe and Timothy, and the Asians Tychicus and Trophimus. 













###### 5 






These went on ahead and were waiting for us [including Luke] at Troas, 













###### 6 






But we [ourselves] sailed from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread [the Passover week], and in five days we joined them at Troas, where we remained for seven days. 













###### 7 






And on the first day of the week, when we were assembled together to break bread [[^a]the Lord's Supper], Paul discoursed with them, intending to leave the next morning; and he kept on with his message until midnight. 













###### 8 






Now there were numerous lights in the upper room where we were assembled, 













###### 9 






And there was a young man named Eutychus sitting in the window. He was borne down with deep sleep as Paul kept on talking still longer, and [finally] completely overcome by sleep, he fell down from the third story and was picked up dead. 













###### 10 






But Paul went down and bent over him and embraced him, saying, Make no ado; his life is within him. 













###### 11 






When Paul had gone back upstairs and had broken bread and eaten [with them], and after he had talked confidentially _and_ communed with them for a considerable time--until daybreak [in fact]--he departed. 













###### 12 






They took the youth home alive, and were not a little comforted _and_ cheered _and_ refreshed _and_ encouraged. 













###### 13 






But going on ahead to the ship, the rest of us set sail for Assos, intending to take Paul aboard there, for that was what he had directed, intending himself to go by land [on foot]. 













###### 14 






So when he met us at Assos, we took him aboard and sailed on to Mitylene. 













###### 15 






And sailing from there, we arrived the day after at a point opposite Chios; the following day we struck across to Samos, and the next day we arrived at Miletus. 













###### 16 






For Paul had determined to sail on past Ephesus, lest he might have to spend time [unnecessarily] in [the province of] Asia; for he was hastening on so that he might reach Jerusalem, if at all possible, by the day of Pentecost. 













###### 17 






However, from Miletus he sent to Ephesus and summoned the elders of the church [to come to him there]. 













###### 18 






And when they arrived he said to them: You yourselves are well acquainted with my manner of living among you from the first day that I set foot in [the province of] Asia, and how I continued afterward, 













###### 19 






Serving the Lord with all humility in tears and in the midst of adversity (affliction and trials) which befell me, due to the plots of the Jews [against me]; 













###### 20 






How I did not shrink from telling you anything that was for your benefit and teaching you in public meetings and from house to house, 













###### 21 






But constantly _and_ earnestly I bore testimony both to Jews and Greeks, urging them to turn in repentance [[^b]that is due] to God and to have faith in our Lord Jesus Christ [[^c]that is due Him]. 













###### 22 






And now, you see, I am going to Jerusalem, bound by the [Holy] Spirit _and_ obligated _and_ compelled by the [convictions of my own] spirit, not knowing what will befall me there-- 













###### 23 






Except that the Holy Spirit clearly _and_ emphatically affirms to me in city after city that imprisonment and suffering await me. 













###### 24 






But _none of these things move me_; neither do I esteem my life dear to myself, if only I may finish my course _with joy_ and the ministry which I have obtained from [which was entrusted to me by] the Lord Jesus, faithfully to attest to the good news (Gospel) of God's grace (His unmerited favor, spiritual blessing, and mercy). 













###### 25 






And now, observe, I perceive that all of you, among whom I have gone in and out proclaiming the kingdom, will see my face no more. 













###### 26 






Therefore I testify _and_ protest to you on this [our parting] day that I am clean _and_ innocent _and_ not responsible for the blood of any of you. 













###### 27 






For I never shrank _or_ kept back _or_ fell short from declaring to you the whole purpose _and_ plan _and_ counsel of God. 













###### 28 






Take care _and_ be on guard for yourselves and the whole flock over which the Holy Spirit has appointed you bishops and guardians, to shepherd (tend and feed and guide) the church of the Lord _or_ [^d]_of God_ which He obtained for Himself [buying it and saving it for Himself] with His own blood. 













###### 29 






I know that after I am gone, ferocious wolves will get in among you, not sparing the flock; 













###### 30 






Even from among your own selves men will come to the front who, by saying perverse (distorted and corrupt) things, will endeavor to draw away the disciples after them [to their own party]. 













###### 31 






Therefore be always alert _and_ on your guard, being mindful that for three years I never stopped night or day seriously to admonish _and_ advise _and_ exhort you one by one with tears. 













###### 32 






And now [brethren], I commit you to God [I deposit you in His charge, entrusting you to His protection and care]. And I commend you to the Word of His grace [to the commands and counsels and promises of His unmerited favor]. It is able to build you up and to give you [your rightful] inheritance among all God's set-apart ones (those consecrated, purified, and transformed of soul). 













###### 33 






I coveted no man's silver or gold or [costly] garments. 













###### 34 






You yourselves know personally that these hands ministered to my own needs and those [of the persons] who were with me. 













###### 35 






In everything I have pointed out to you [by example] that, by working diligently in this manner, we ought to assist the weak, being mindful of the words of the Lord Jesus, how He Himself said, It is more blessed (makes one happier and more [^e]to be envied) to give than to receive. 













###### 36 






Having spoken thus, he knelt down with them all and prayed. 













###### 37 






And they all wept freely and threw their arms around Paul's neck and kissed him fervently _and_ repeatedly, 













###### 38 






Being especially distressed _and_ sorrowful because he had stated that they were about to see his face no more. And they accompanied him to the ship. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

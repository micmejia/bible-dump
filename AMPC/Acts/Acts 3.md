# Acts 3

***














###### 1 






Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour (three o'clock in the afternoon), 













###### 2 






[When] a certain man crippled from his birth was being carried along, who was laid each day at that gate of the temple [which is] called Beautiful, so that he might beg for charitable gifts from those who entered the temple. 













###### 3 






So when he saw Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked them to give him a gift. 













###### 4 






And Peter directed his gaze intently at him, and so did John, and said, Look at us! 













###### 5 






And [the man] paid attention to them, expecting that he was going to get something from them. 













###### 6 






But Peter said, Silver and gold (money) I do not have; but what I do have, that I give to you: in [the [^a]use of] the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk! 













###### 7 






Then he took hold of the man's right hand with a firm grip and raised him up. And at once his feet and ankle bones became strong _and_ steady, 













###### 8 






And leaping forth he stood and [^b]began to walk, and he went into the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God. 













###### 9 






And all the people saw him walking about and praising God, 













###### 10 






And they recognized him as the man who usually sat [begging] for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple; and they were filled with wonder and amazement (bewilderment, consternation) over what had occurred to him. 













###### 11 






Now while he [still] firmly clung to Peter and John, all the people in utmost amazement ran together _and_ crowded around them in the covered porch (walk) called Solomon's. 













###### 12 






And Peter, seeing it, answered the people, You men of Israel, why are you so surprised _and_ wondering at this? Why do you keep staring at us, as though by our [own individual] power _or_ [active] piety we had made this man [able] to walk? 













###### 13 






The God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob, the God of our forefathers, has glorified His Servant _and_ [^c]Son Jesus [doing Him this honor], Whom you indeed delivered up and denied _and_ rejected _and_ disowned in the presence of Pilate, when he had determined to let Him go. 













###### 14 






But you denied _and_ rejected _and_ disowned the Pure _and_ Holy, the Just _and_ Blameless One, and demanded [the pardon of] a murderer to be granted to you. 













###### 15 






But you killed the very Source (the Author) of life, Whom God raised from the dead. To this we are witnesses. 













###### 16 






And His name, through _and_ by faith in His name, has made this man whom you see and recognize well _and_ strong. [Yes] the faith which is through _and_ by Him [Jesus] has given the man this perfect soundness [of body] before all of you. 













###### 17 






And now, brethren, I know that you acted in ignorance [not aware of what you were doing], as did your rulers also. 













###### 18 






Thus has God fulfilled what He foretold by the mouth of all the prophets, that His Christ (the Messiah) should undergo ill treatment _and_ be afflicted _and_ suffer. 













###### 19 






So repent (change your mind and purpose); turn around _and_ return [to God], that your sins may be erased (blotted out, wiped clean), that times of refreshing (of recovering from the effects of heat, of [^d]reviving with fresh air) may come from the presence of the Lord; 













###### 20 






And that He may send [to you] the Christ (the Messiah), Who before was designated _and_ appointed for you--even Jesus, 













###### 21 






Whom heaven must receive [and retain] until the time for the complete restoration of all that God spoke by the mouth of all His holy prophets for ages past [from the most ancient time in the memory of man]. 













###### 22 






Thus Moses said _to the forefathers_, The Lord God will raise up for you a Prophet from among your brethren as [He raised up] me; Him you shall listen to _and_ understand by hearing _and_ heed in all things whatever He tells you. 













###### 23 






And it shall be that every soul that does not listen to _and_ understand by hearing _and_ heed that Prophet shall be utterly [^e]exterminated from among the people. 













###### 24 






Indeed, all the prophets from Samuel and those who came afterwards, as many as have spoken, also promised _and_ foretold _and_ proclaimed these days. 













###### 25 






You are the descendants (sons) of the prophets and the heirs of the covenant which God made _and_ gave to your forefathers, saying to Abraham, And in your Seed (Heir) shall all the families of the earth be blessed _and_ benefited. 













###### 26 






It was to you first that God sent His Servant _and_ Son _Jesus_, when He raised Him up [[^f]provided and gave Him for us], to bless you in turning every one of you from your wickedness _and_ evil ways.

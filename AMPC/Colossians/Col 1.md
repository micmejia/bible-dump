# Colossians 1

***














###### 1 






Paul, an apostle (special messenger) of Christ Jesus (the Messiah), by the will of God, and Timothy [our] brother, 













###### 2 






To the saints (the consecrated people of God) and believing _and_ faithful brethren in Christ who are at Colossae: Grace (spiritual favor and blessing) to you and [heart] peace from God our Father. 













###### 3 






We continually give thanks to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah), as we are praying for you, 













###### 4 






For we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus [the leaning of your entire human personality on Him in absolute trust and confidence in His power, wisdom, and goodness] and of the love which you [have and show] for all the saints (God's consecrated ones), 













###### 5 






Because of the hope [of experiencing what is] laid up (reserved and waiting) for you in heaven. Of this [hope] you heard in the past in the message of the truth of the Gospel, 













###### 6 






Which has come to you. Indeed, in the whole world [that Gospel] is bearing fruit _and_ still is growing [by its own inherent power], even as it has done among yourselves ever since the day you first heard and came to know _and_ understand the grace of God in truth. [You came to know the grace or undeserved favor of God in reality, deeply and clearly and thoroughly, becoming accurately and intimately acquainted with it.] 













###### 7 






You so learned it from Epaphras, our beloved fellow servant. He is a faithful minister of Christ in our stead _and_ as our representative _and_ _yours_. 













###### 8 






Also he has informed us of your love in the [Holy] Spirit. 













###### 9 






For this reason we also, from the day we heard of it, have not ceased to pray _and_ make [special] request for you, [asking] that you may be filled with the full (deep and clear) knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom [in comprehensive insight into the ways and purposes of God] and in understanding _and_ discernment of spiritual things-- 













###### 10 






That you may walk (live and conduct yourselves) in a manner worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to Him _and_ desiring to please Him in all things, bearing fruit in every good work and steadily growing _and_ increasing in _and_ by the knowledge of God [with fuller, deeper, and clearer insight, acquaintance, and recognition]. 













###### 11 






[We pray] that you may be invigorated _and_ strengthened with all power according to the might of His glory, [to exercise] every kind of endurance and patience (perseverance and forbearance) with joy, 













###### 12 






Giving thanks to the Father, Who has qualified _and_ made us fit to share the portion which is the inheritance of the saints (God's holy people) in the Light. 













###### 13 






[The Father] has delivered _and_ drawn us to Himself out of the control _and_ the dominion of darkness and has transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love, 













###### 14 






In Whom we have our redemption _through His blood_, [which means] the forgiveness of our sins. 













###### 15 






[Now] He is the exact likeness of the unseen God [the visible representation of the invisible]; He is the Firstborn of all creation. 













###### 16 






For it was in Him that all things were created, in heaven and on earth, things seen and things unseen, whether thrones, dominions, rulers, or authorities; all things were created _and_ exist through Him [by His service, intervention] and in _and_ for Him. 













###### 17 






And He Himself existed before all things, and in Him all things consist (cohere, are held together). 













###### 18 






He also is the Head of [His] body, the church; seeing He is the Beginning, the Firstborn from among the dead, so that He alone in everything _and_ in every respect might occupy the chief place [stand first and be preeminent]. 













###### 19 






For it has pleased [the Father] that all the divine fullness (the sum total of the divine perfection, powers, and attributes) should dwell in Him permanently. 













###### 20 






And God purposed that through (by the service, the intervention of) Him [the Son] all things should be completely reconciled back to Himself, whether on earth or in heaven, as through Him, [the Father] made peace by means of the blood of His cross. 













###### 21 






And although you at one time were estranged _and_ alienated from Him and were of hostile attitude of mind in your wicked activities, 













###### 22 






Yet now has [Christ, the Messiah] reconciled [you to God] in the body of His flesh through death, in order to present you holy and faultless and irreproachable in His [the Father's] presence. 













###### 23 






[And this He will do] provided that you continue to stay with _and_ in the faith [in Christ], well-grounded and settled _and_ steadfast, not shifting _or_ moving away from the hope [which rests on and is inspired by] the glad tidings (the Gospel), which you heard and which has been preached [as being designed for and offered without restrictions] to every person under heaven, and of which [Gospel] I, Paul, became a minister. 













###### 24 






[Even] now I rejoice in the midst of my sufferings on your behalf. And in my own person I am making up whatever is still lacking _and_ remains to be completed [on our part] of Christ's afflictions, for the sake of His body, which is the church. 













###### 25 






In it I became a minister in accordance with the divine stewardship which was entrusted to me for you [as its object and for your benefit], to make the Word of God fully known [among you]-- 













###### 26 






The mystery of which was hidden for ages and generations [from angels and men], but is now revealed to His holy people (the saints), 













###### 27 






To whom God was pleased to make known how great for the Gentiles are the riches of the glory of this mystery, which is Christ within _and_ among you, the Hope of [realizing the] glory. 













###### 28 






Him we preach _and_ proclaim, warning _and_ admonishing everyone and instructing everyone in all wisdom (comprehensive insight into the ways and purposes of God), that we may present every person mature (full-grown, fully initiated, complete, and perfect) in Christ (the Anointed One). 













###### 29 






For this I labor [unto weariness], striving with all the [^aa]superhuman energy which He so mightily enkindles _and_ works within me.

# Colossians 2

***














###### 1 






For I want you to know how great is my solicitude for you [how severe an inward struggle I am engaged in for you] and for those [believers] at Laodicea, and for all who [[^a]like yourselves] have never seen my face _and_ known me personally. 













###### 2 






[For my concern is] that their hearts may be [^b]braced (comforted, cheered, and encouraged) as they are knit together in love, that they may come to have all the abounding wealth _and_ blessings of assured conviction of understanding, and that they may become progressively [^c]more intimately acquainted with _and_ may know more definitely _and_ accurately _and_ thoroughly that mystic secret of God, [which is] Christ (the Anointed One). 













###### 3 






In Him all the treasures of [divine] wisdom ([^d]comprehensive insight into the ways and purposes of God) and [all the riches of spiritual] knowledge _and_ enlightenment are stored up _and_ lie hidden. 













###### 4 






I say this in order that no one may mislead _and_ delude you by plausible _and_ persuasive _and_ attractive arguments _and_ beguiling speech. 













###### 5 






For though I am away from you in body, yet I am with you in spirit, delighted at the sight of your [standing shoulder to shoulder in such] orderly array and the firmness _and_ the solid front _and_ steadfastness of your faith in Christ [that [^e]leaning of the entire human personality on Him in absolute trust and confidence in His power, wisdom, and goodness]. 













###### 6 






As you have therefore received Christ, [even] Jesus the Lord, [so] walk (regulate your lives and conduct yourselves) in union with _and_ conformity to Him. 













###### 7 






Have the roots [of your being] firmly _and_ deeply planted [in Him, fixed and founded in Him], being continually built up in Him, becoming increasingly more confirmed _and_ established in the faith, just as you were taught, and abounding _and_ overflowing in it with thanksgiving. 













###### 8 






See to it that no one carries you off as spoil _or_ makes you yourselves captive by his so-called philosophy _and_ intellectualism and vain deceit (idle fancies and plain nonsense), following human tradition (men's ideas of the material rather than the spiritual world), just crude notions following the rudimentary _and_ elemental teachings of the universe and disregarding [the teachings of] Christ (the Messiah). 













###### 9 






For in Him the whole fullness of Deity (the Godhead) continues to dwell in bodily form [giving complete expression of the divine nature]. 













###### 10 






And you [^f]are in Him, made full _and_ having come to fullness of life [in Christ you too are filled with the Godhead--Father, Son and Holy Spirit--and reach full spiritual stature]. And He is the Head of all rule and authority [of every angelic principality and power]. 













###### 11 






In Him also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, but in a [spiritual] circumcision [performed by] Christ by stripping off the body of the flesh (the whole corrupt, carnal nature with its passions and lusts). 













###### 12 






[Thus [^g]you were circumcised when] you were buried with Him in [your] baptism, in which you were also raised with Him [[^h]to a new life] through [your] faith in the working of God [[^i]as displayed] when He raised Him up from the dead. 













###### 13 






And you who were dead in trespasses and in the uncircumcision of your flesh (your sensuality, your sinful carnal nature), [God] brought to life together with [Christ], having [freely] forgiven us all our transgressions, 













###### 14 






Having cancelled _and_ blotted out _and_ wiped away the handwriting of the note (bond) with its legal decrees _and_ demands which was in force _and_ stood against us (hostile to us). This [note with its regulations, decrees, and demands] He set aside _and_ cleared [^j]completely out of our way by nailing it to [His] cross. 













###### 15 






[God] disarmed the principalities and powers that were ranged against us and made a bold display _and_ public example of them, in triumphing over them in Him _and_ in it [the cross]. 













###### 16 






Therefore let no one sit in judgment on you in matters of food and drink, or with regard to a feast day or a New Moon or a Sabbath. 













###### 17 






Such [things] are only the shadow of things that are to come, _and_ they have only a symbolic value. But the reality (the substance, the solid fact of what is foreshadowed, the body of it) belongs to Christ. 













###### 18 






Let no one defraud you by acting as an umpire _and_ declaring you unworthy _and_ disqualifying you for the prize, insisting on self-abasement and worship of angels, taking his stand on visions [he claims] he has seen, vainly puffed up by his sensuous notions _and_ inflated by his unspiritual thoughts _and_ fleshly conceit, 













###### 19 






And not holding fast to the Head, from Whom the entire body, supplied and knit together by means of its joints and ligaments, grows with a growth that is from God. 













###### 20 






If then you have died with Christ to material ways of looking at things _and_ have escaped from the world's crude _and_ elemental notions _and_ teachings of externalism, why do you live as if you still belong to the world? [Why do you submit to rules _and_ regulations?--such as] 













###### 21 






Do not handle [this], Do not taste [that], Do not even touch [them], 













###### 22 






Referring to things all of which perish with being used. To do this is to follow human precepts and doctrines. 













###### 23 






Such [practices] have indeed the outward appearance [that popularly passes] for wisdom, in promoting self-imposed rigor of devotion _and_ delight in self-humiliation _and_ severity of discipline of the body, but they are of no value in checking the indulgence of the flesh (the lower nature). [Instead, they do not honor God but serve only to indulge the flesh.]

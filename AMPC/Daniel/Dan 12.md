# Daniel 12

***














###### 1 






And at that time [of the end] Michael shall arise, the great [angelic] prince who defends _and_ has charge of your [Daniel's] people. And there shall be a time of trouble, straitness, _and_ distress such as never was since there was a nation till that time. But at that time your people shall be delivered, everyone whose name shall be found written in the Book [of God's plan for His own]. 













###### 2 






And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake: some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt _and_ abhorrence. 













###### 3 






And the teachers _and_ those who are wise shall shine like the brightness of the firmament, and those who turn many to righteousness (to uprightness and right standing with God) [shall give forth light] like the stars forever and ever. 













###### 4 






But you, O Daniel, shut up the words and seal the Book until the time of the end. [Then] many shall run to and fro _and_ search anxiously [through the Book], and knowledge [of God's purposes as revealed by His prophets] shall be increased _and_ become great. 













###### 5 






Then I, Daniel, looked, and behold, there stood two others, the one on the brink of the river on this side and the other on the brink of the river on that side. 













###### 6 






And one said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders? 













###### 7 






And I heard the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, when he held up his right and his left hand toward the heavens and swore by Him Who lives forever that it shall be for a time, times, and a half a time [or three and one-half years]; and when they have made an end of shattering _and_ crushing the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished. 













###### 8 






And I heard, but I did not understand. Then I said, O my lord, what shall be the issue _and_ final end of these things? 













###### 9 






And he [the angel] said, Go your way, Daniel, for the words are shut up and sealed till the time of the end. 













###### 10 






Many shall purify themselves and make themselves white and be tried, smelted, _and_ refined, but the wicked shall do wickedly. And none of the wicked shall understand, but the teachers _and_ those who are wise shall understand. 













###### 11 






And from the time that the continual burnt offering is taken away and the abomination that makes desolate is set up, there shall be 1,290 days. 













###### 12 






Blessed, happy, fortunate, spiritually prosperous, _and_ to be envied is he who waits expectantly _and_ earnestly [who endures without wavering beyond the period of tribulation] and comes to the 1,335 days! 













###### 13 






But you [Daniel, who was now over ninety years of age], go your way until the end; for you shall rest and shall stand [fast] in your allotted place at the end of the days.

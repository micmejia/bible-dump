# Daniel 9

***














###### 1 






In the first year of Darius son of Ahasuerus, of the offspring of the Medes, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans-- 













###### 2 






In the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, understood from the books the number of years which, according to the word of the Lord to Jeremiah the prophet, must pass by before the desolations [which had been] pronounced on Jerusalem should end; and it was seventy years. 













###### 3 






And I set my face to the Lord God to seek Him by prayer and supplications, with fasting and sackcloth and ashes; 













###### 4 






And I prayed to the Lord my God and made confession and said, O Lord, the great and dreadful God, Who keeps covenant, mercy, _and_ loving-kindness with those who love Him and keep His commandments, 













###### 5 






We have sinned and dealt perversely and done wickedly and have rebelled, turning aside from Your commandments and ordinances. 













###### 6 






Neither have we listened to _and_ heeded Your servants the prophets, who spoke in Your name to our kings, our princes and our fathers, and to all the people of the land. 













###### 7 






O Lord, righteousness belongs to You, but to us confusion _and_ shame of face, as at this day--to the men of Judah, to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to all Israel, to those who are near and those who are far off, through all the countries to which You have driven them because of the [treacherous] trespass which they have committed against You. 













###### 8 






O Lord, to us belong confusion _and_ shame of face--to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers--because we have sinned against You. 













###### 9 






To the Lord our God belong mercy _and_ loving-kindness and forgiveness, for we have rebelled against Him; 













###### 10 






And we have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God by walking in His laws which He set before us through His servants the prophets. 













###### 11 






Yes, all Israel has transgressed Your law, even turning aside that they might not obey Your voice. Therefore the curse has been poured out on us and the oath that is written in the Law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against Him. 













###### 12 






And He has carried out intact His [threatening] words which He threatened against us and against our judges [the kings, princes, and rulers generally] who ruled us, and He has brought upon us a great evil; for under the whole heavens there has not been done before [anything so dreadful] as [He has caused to be] done against Jerusalem. 













###### 13 






Just as it is written in the Law of Moses as to all this evil [that would surely come upon transgressors], so it has come upon us. Yet we have not earnestly begged for forgiveness _and_ entreated the favor of the Lord our God, that we might turn from our iniquities and have understanding _and_ become wise in Your truth. 













###### 14 






Therefore the Lord has kept ready the calamity (evil) and has brought it upon us, for the Lord our God is [uncompromisingly] righteous _and_ rigidly just in all His works which He does [keeping His word]; and we have not obeyed His voice. 













###### 15 






And now, O Lord our God, Who brought Your people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand and secured Yourself renown _and_ a name as at this day, we have sinned, we have done wickedly! 













###### 16 






O Lord, according to all Your rightness _and_ justice, I beseech You, let Your anger and Your wrath be turned away from Your city Jerusalem, Your holy mountain. Because of our sins and the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and Your people have become a reproach _and_ a byword to all who are around about us. 













###### 17 






Now therefore, O our God, listen to _and_ heed the prayer of Your servant [^a][Daniel] and his supplications, and for Your own sake cause Your face to shine upon Your sanctuary which is desolate. 













###### 18 






O my God, incline Your ear and hear; open Your eyes and look at our desolations and the city which is called by Your name; for we do not present our supplications before You for our own righteousness _and_ justice, but for Your great mercy _and_ loving-kindness. 













###### 19 






O Lord, hear! O Lord, forgive! O Lord, give heed and act! Do not delay, for Your own sake, O my God, because Your city and Your people are called by Your name. 













###### 20 






While I was speaking and praying, confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God for the holy hill of my God-- 













###### 21 






Yes, while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the former vision, being caused to fly swiftly, came near to me _and_ touched me about the time of the evening sacrifice. 













###### 22 






He instructed me _and_ made me understand; he talked with me and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give you skill _and_ wisdom and understanding. 













###### 23 






At the beginning of your prayers, the word [giving an answer] went forth, and I have come to tell you, for you are greatly beloved. Therefore consider the matter and understand the vision. 













###### 24 






Seventy weeks [of years, or 490 years] are decreed upon your people and upon your holy city [Jerusalem], to finish _and_ put an end to transgression, to seal up _and_ make full the measure of sin, to purge away _and_ make expiation _and_ reconciliation for sin, to bring in everlasting righteousness (permanent moral and spiritual rectitude in every area and relation) to seal up vision and prophecy _and_ prophet, and to anoint a Holy of Holies. 













###### 25 






Know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem until [the coming of] the Anointed One, a Prince, shall be seven weeks [of years] and sixty-two weeks [of years]; it shall be built again with [city] square and moat, but in troublous times. 













###### 26 






And after the sixty-two weeks [of years] shall the Anointed One be cut off _or_ killed and shall have nothing [and no one] belonging to [and defending] Him. And the people of the [other] prince who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. Its end shall come with a flood; and even to the end there shall be war, and desolations are decreed. 













###### 27 






And he shall enter into a strong _and_ firm covenant with the many for one week [seven years]. And in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and offering to cease [for the remaining three and one-half years]; and upon the wing _or_ pinnacle of abominations [shall come] one who makes desolate, until the full determined end is poured out on the desolator. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Ecclesiastes 1

***














###### 1 






The words of the Preacher, the son of David and king in Jerusalem. 













###### 2 






Vapor of vapors _and_ futility of futilities, says the Preacher. Vapor of vapors _and_ futility of futilities! All is vanity (emptiness, falsity, and vainglory). 













###### 3 






What profit does man have left from all his toil at which he toils under the sun? [Is life worth living?] 













###### 4 






One generation goes and another generation comes, but the earth remains forever. 













###### 5 






The sun also rises and the sun goes down, and hastens to the place where it rises. 













###### 6 






The wind goes to the south and circles about to the north; it circles _and_ circles about continually, and on its circuit the wind returns again. 













###### 7 






All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full. To the place from which the rivers come, to there _and_ from there they return again. 













###### 8 






All things are weary with toil _and_ all words are feeble; man cannot utter it. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing. 













###### 9 






The thing that has been--it is what will be again, and that which has been done is that which will be done again; and there is nothing new under the sun. 













###### 10 






Is there a thing of which it may be said, See, this is new? It has already been, in the vast ages of time [recorded or unrecorded] which were before us. 













###### 11 






There is no remembrance of former happenings _or_ men, neither will there be any remembrance of happenings of generations that are to come by those who are to come after them. 













###### 12 






I, the Preacher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem. 













###### 13 






And I applied myself by heart _and_ mind to seek and search out by [human] wisdom all human activity under heaven. It is a miserable business which God has given to the sons of man with which to busy themselves. 













###### 14 






I have seen all the works that are done under the sun, and behold, all is vanity, a striving after the wind _and_ a feeding on wind. 













###### 15 






What is crooked cannot be made straight, and what is defective _and_ lacking cannot be counted. 













###### 16 






I entered into counsel with my own mind, saying, Behold, I have acquired great [human] wisdom, yes, more than all who have been over Jerusalem before me; and my mind has had great experience of [moral] wisdom and [scientific] knowledge. 













###### 17 






And I gave my mind to know [practical] wisdom and to discern [the character of] madness and folly [in which men seem to find satisfaction]; I perceived that this also is a searching after wind _and_ a feeding on it. 













###### 18 






For in much [human] wisdom is much vexation, and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.

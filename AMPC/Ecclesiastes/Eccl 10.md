# Ecclesiastes 10

***














###### 1 






Dead flies cause the ointment of the perfumer to putrefy [and] send forth a vile odor; so does a little folly [in him who is valued for wisdom] outweigh wisdom and honor. 













###### 2 






A wise man's heart turns him toward his right hand, but a fool's heart toward his left. 













###### 3 






Even when he who is a fool walks along the road, his heart _and_ understanding fail him, and he says of everyone _and_ to everyone that he is a fool. 













###### 4 






If the temper of the ruler rises up against you, do not leave your place [or show a resisting spirit]; for gentleness _and_ calmness prevent _or_ put a stop to great offenses. 













###### 5 






There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, like an error which proceeds from the ruler: 













###### 6 






Folly is set in great dignity _and_ in high places, and the rich sit in low places. 













###### 7 






I have seen slaves on horses, and princes walking like slaves on the earth. 













###### 8 






He who digs a pit [for others] will fall into it, and whoever breaks through a fence _or_ a [stone] wall, a serpent will bite him. 













###### 9 






Whoever removes [landmark] stones _or_ hews out [new ones with similar intent] will be hurt with them, _and_ he who fells trees will be endangered by them. 













###### 10 






If the ax is dull and the man does not whet the edge, he must put forth more strength; but wisdom helps him to succeed. 













###### 11 






If the serpent bites before it is charmed, then it is no use to call a charmer [and the slanderer is no better than the uncharmed snake]. 













###### 12 






The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious _and_ win him favor, but the lips of a fool consume him. 













###### 13 






The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness, and the end of his talk is wicked madness. 













###### 14 






A fool also multiplies words, though no man can tell what will be--and what will happen after he is gone, who can tell him? 













###### 15 






The labor of fools wearies every one of them, because [he is so ignorant of the ordinary matters that] he does not even know how to get to town. 













###### 16 






Woe to you, O land, when your king is a child _or_ a servant and when your officials feast in the morning! 













###### 17 






Happy (fortunate and to be envied) are you, O land, when your king is a free man _and_ of noble birth _and_ character and when your officials feast at the proper time--for strength and not for drunkenness! 













###### 18 






Through indolence the rafters [of state affairs] decay _and_ the roof sinks in, and through idleness of the hands the house leaks. 













###### 19 






[Instead of repairing the breaches, the officials] make a feast for laughter, serve wine to cheer life, and [depend on tax] money to answer for all of it. 













###### 20 






Curse not the king, no, not even in your thoughts, and curse not the rich in your bedchamber, for a bird of the air will carry the voice, and a winged creature will tell the matter. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

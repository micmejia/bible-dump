# Exodus 35

***














###### 1 






Moses gathered all the congregation of the Israelites together and said to them, These are the things which the Lord has commanded that you do: 













###### 2 






Six days shall work be done, but the seventh day shall be to you a holy day, a Sabbath of rest to the Lord; whoever works [on that day] shall be put to death. 













###### 3 






You shall kindle no fire in all your dwellings on the Sabbath day. 













###### 4 






And Moses said to all the congregation of the Israelites, This is what the Lord commanded: 













###### 5 






Take from among you an offering to the Lord. Whoever is of a willing _and_ generous heart, let him bring the Lord's offering: gold, silver, and bronze; 













###### 6 






Blue, purple, and scarlet [stuff], fine linen; goats' hair; 













###### 7 






And rams' skins tanned red, and skins of dolphins _or_ porpoises; and acacia wood; 













###### 8 






And oil for the light; and spices for anointing oil and for fragrant incense; 













###### 9 






And onyx stones and other stones to be set for the ephod and the breastplate. 













###### 10 






And let every able _and_ wisehearted man among you come and make all that the Lord has commanded: 













###### 11 






The tabernacle, its tent and its covering, its hooks, its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets _or_ bases; 













###### 12 






The ark and its poles, with the mercy seat, and the veil of the screen; 













###### 13 






The table and its poles and all its utensils, and the showbread (the bread of the Presence); 













###### 14 






The lampstand also for the light, and its utensils and its lamps, and the oil for the light; 













###### 15 






And the incense altar and its poles, the anointing oil and the fragrant incense, the hanging _or_ screen for the door at the entrance of the tabernacle; 













###### 16 






The altar of burnt offering, with its bronze grating, its poles and all its utensils, the laver and its base; 













###### 17 






The court's hangings, its pillars and their sockets _or_ bases, and the hanging _or_ screen for the gate of the court; 













###### 18 






The pegs of the tabernacle and of the court, and their cords, 













###### 19 






The finely wrought garments for ministering in the Holy Place, the holy garments for Aaron the [high] priest and for his sons to minister as priests. 













###### 20 






Then all the congregation of the Israelites left Moses' presence. 













###### 21 






And they came, each one whose heart stirred him up and whose spirit made him willing, and brought the Lord's offering to be used for the [new] Tent of Meeting, for all its service, and the holy garments. 













###### 22 






They came, both men and women, all who were willinghearted, and brought brooches, earrings _or_ nose rings, signet rings, and armlets _or_ necklaces, all jewels of gold, everyone bringing an offering of gold to the Lord. 













###### 23 






And everyone with whom was found blue or purple or scarlet [stuff], or fine linen, or goats' hair, or rams' skins made red [in tanning], or dolphin _or_ porpoise skins brought them. 













###### 24 






Everyone who could make an offering of silver or bronze brought it as the Lord's offering, and every man with whom was found any acacia wood for any work of the service brought it. 













###### 25 






All the women who had ability _and_ were wisehearted spun with their hands and brought what they had spun of blue and purple and scarlet [stuff] and fine linen; 













###### 26 






And all the women who had ability _and_ whose hearts stirred them up in wisdom spun the goats' hair. 













###### 27 






The leaders brought onyx stones and stones to be set for the ephod and for the breastplate, 













###### 28 






And spice, and oil for the light and for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense. 













###### 29 






The Israelites brought a freewill offering to the Lord, all men and women whose hearts made them willing _and_ moved them to bring anything for any of the work which the Lord had commanded by Moses to be done. 













###### 30 






And Moses said to the Israelites, See, the Lord called by name Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah; 













###### 31 






And He has filled him with the Spirit of God, with ability _and_ wisdom, with intelligence _and_ understanding, and with knowledge and all craftsmanship, 













###### 32 






To devise artistic designs, to work in gold, silver, and bronze, 













###### 33 






In cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, for work in every skilled craft. 













###### 34 






And God has put in Bezalel's heart that he may teach, both he and Aholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. 













###### 35 






He has filled them with wisdom of heart _and_ ability to do all manner of craftsmanship, of the engraver, of the skillful workman, of the embroiderer in blue, purple, and scarlet [stuff] and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of those who do or design any skilled work. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Ezekiel 15

***














###### 1 






And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, 













###### 2 






Son of man, How is the wood of the grapevine [Israel] more than that of any tree, the vine branch which was among the trees of the forest? 













###### 3 






Shall wood be taken from it to do any work? Or will men take a peg of it on which to hang any vessel? 













###### 4 






Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire consumes both ends of it and the middle of it is charred. Is it suitable _or_ profitable for any work? 













###### 5 






Notice, even when it was whole, it was good for no work; how much less shall it be useful _and_ profitable when the fire has devoured it and it is charred? 













###### 6 






Therefore thus says the Lord God: Like the wood of the grapevine among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give up the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 













###### 7 






And I will set My face against them; they shall go out from one fire and another fire shall devour them, and you shall know (understand and realize) that I am the Lord, when I set My face against them. 













###### 8 






And I will make the land desolate (laid waste and deserted) because they have acted faithlessly [through their idolatry], says the Lord. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

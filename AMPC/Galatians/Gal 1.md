# Galatians 1

***


###### 1 


Paul, an apostle--[special messenger appointed and commissioned and sent out] not from [any body of] men nor by _or_ through any man, but by _and_ through Jesus Christ (the Messiah) and God the Father, Who raised Him from among the dead-- 


###### 2 


And all the brethren who are with me, to the churches of Galatia: 


###### 3 


Grace _and_ spiritual blessing be to you and [soul] peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah), 


###### 4 


Who gave (yielded) Himself up [to atone] for our sins [and to save and sanctify us], in order to rescue _and_ deliver us from this present wicked age _and_ world order, in accordance with the will _and_ purpose _and_ plan of our God and Father-- 


###### 5 


To Him [be ascribed all] the glory through all the ages of the ages _and_ the eternities of the eternities! Amen (so be it). 


###### 6 


I am surprised _and_ astonished that you are so quickly turning renegade _and_ deserting Him Who invited _and_ called you by the grace (unmerited favor) of Christ (the Messiah) [and that you are transferring your allegiance] to a different [even an opposition] gospel. 


###### 7 


Not that there is [or could be] any other [genuine Gospel], but there are [obviously] some who are troubling _and_ disturbing _and_ bewildering you [with a different kind of teaching which they offer as a gospel] and want to pervert _and_ distort the Gospel of Christ (the Messiah) [into something which it absolutely is not]. 


###### 8 


But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to _and_ different from that which we preached to you, let him be accursed (anathema, devoted to destruction, doomed to eternal punishment)! 


###### 9 


As we said before, so I now say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel different from _or_ contrary to that which you received [from us], let him be accursed (anathema, devoted to destruction, doomed to eternal punishment)! 


###### 10 


Now am I trying to win the favor of men, or of God? Do I seek to please men? If I were still seeking popularity with men, I should not be a bond servant of Christ (the Messiah). 


###### 11 


For I want you to know, brethren, that the Gospel which was proclaimed _and_ made known by me is not man's gospel [a human invention, according to or patterned after any human standard]. 


###### 12 


For indeed I did not receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but [it came to me] through a [direct] revelation [given] by Jesus Christ (the Messiah). 


###### 13 


You have heard of my earlier career _and_ former manner of life in the Jewish religion (Judaism), how I persecuted _and_ abused the church of God furiously _and_ extensively, and [with fanatical zeal did my best] to make havoc of it _and_ destroy it. 


###### 14 


And [you have heard how] I outstripped many of the men of my own generation among the people of my race in [my advancement in study and observance of the laws of] Judaism, so extremely enthusiastic _and_ zealous I was for the traditions of my ancestors. 


###### 15 


But when He, Who had chosen _and_ set me apart [even] before I was born and had called me by His grace (His undeserved favor and blessing), saw fit _and_ was pleased 


###### 16 


To reveal (unveil, disclose) His Son within me so that I might proclaim Him among the Gentiles (the non-Jewish world) as the glad tidings (Gospel), immediately I did not confer with flesh and blood [did not consult or counsel with any frail human being or communicate with anyone]. 


###### 17 


Nor did I [even] go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles (special messengers of Christ) before I was, but I went away _and_ retired into Arabia, and afterward I came back again to Damascus. 


###### 18 


Then three years later, I did go up to Jerusalem to become [personally] acquainted with Cephas (Peter), and remained with him for fifteen days. 


###### 19 


But I did not see any of the other apostles (the special messengers of Christ) except James the brother of our Lord. 


###### 20 


Now [note carefully what I am telling you, for it is the truth], I write this as if I were standing before the bar of God; I do not lie. 


###### 21 


Then I went into the districts (countries, regions) of Syria and Cilicia. 


###### 22 


And so far I was still unknown by sight to the churches of Christ in Judea (the country surrounding Jerusalem). 


###### 23 


They were only hearing it said, He who used to persecute us is now proclaiming the very faith he once reviled _and_ which he set out to ruin _and_ tried with all his might to destroy. 


###### 24 


And they glorified God [as the Author and Source of what had taken place] in me.

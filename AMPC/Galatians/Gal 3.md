# Galatians 3

***














###### 1 






O you poor _and_ silly _and_ thoughtless _and_ unreflecting _and_ senseless Galatians! Who has fascinated _or_ bewitched _or_ cast a spell over you, unto whom--right before your very eyes--Jesus Christ (the Messiah) was openly _and_ graphically set forth _and_ portrayed as crucified? 













###### 2 






Let me ask you this one question: Did you receive the [Holy] Spirit as the result of obeying the Law _and_ doing its works, or was it by hearing [the message of the Gospel] and believing [it]? [Was it from observing a law of rituals or from a message of faith?] 













###### 3 






Are you so foolish _and_ so senseless _and_ so silly? Having begun [your new life spiritually] with the [Holy] Spirit, are you now reaching perfection [by dependence] on the flesh? 













###### 4 






Have you suffered so many things _and_ experienced so much all for nothing (to no purpose)--if it really is to no purpose _and_ in vain? 













###### 5 






Then does He Who supplies you with His marvelous [Holy] Spirit and works powerfully _and_ miraculously among you do so on [the grounds of your doing] what the Law demands, or because of your believing in _and_ adhering to _and_ trusting in _and_ relying on the message that you heard? 













###### 6 






Thus Abraham believed in _and_ adhered to _and_ trusted in _and_ relied on God, and it was reckoned _and_ placed to his account _and_ credited as righteousness (as conformity to the divine will in purpose, thought, and action). 













###### 7 






Know _and_ understand that it is [really] the people [who live] by faith who are [the true] sons of Abraham. 













###### 8 






And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify (declare righteous, put in right standing with Himself) the Gentiles in consequence of faith, proclaimed the Gospel [foretelling the glad tidings of a Savior long beforehand] to Abraham in the promise, saying, In you shall all the nations [of the earth] be blessed. 













###### 9 






So then, those who are people of faith are blessed _and_ made happy _and_ favored by God [as partners in fellowship] with the believing _and_ trusting Abraham. 













###### 10 






And all who depend on the Law [who are seeking to be justified by obedience to the Law of rituals] are under a curse _and_ doomed to disappointment _and_ destruction, for it is written in the Scriptures, Cursed (accursed, devoted to destruction, doomed to eternal punishment) be everyone who does not continue to abide (live and remain) by all the precepts _and_ commands written in the Book of the Law and to practice them. 













###### 11 






Now it is evident that no person is justified (declared righteous and brought into right standing with God) through the Law, for the Scripture says, The man in right standing with God [the just, the righteous] shall live by _and_ out of faith _and_ he who through _and_ by faith is declared righteous _and_ in right standing with God shall live. 













###### 12 






But the Law does not rest on faith [does not require faith, has nothing to do with faith], for it itself says, He who does them [the things prescribed by the Law] shall live by them [not by faith]. 













###### 13 






Christ purchased our freedom [redeeming us] from the curse (doom) of the Law [and its condemnation] by [Himself] becoming a curse for us, for it is written [in the Scriptures], Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree (is crucified); 













###### 14 






To the end that through [their receiving] Christ Jesus, the blessing [promised] to Abraham might come upon the Gentiles, so that we through faith might [all] receive [the realization of] the promise of the [Holy] Spirit. 













###### 15 






To speak in terms of human relations, brethren, [if] even a man makes a last will and testament (a merely human covenant), no one sets it aside _or_ makes it void _or_ adds to it when once it has been drawn up _and_ signed (ratified, confirmed). 













###### 16 






Now the promises (covenants, agreements) were decreed _and_ made to Abraham and his Seed (his Offspring, his Heir). He [God] does not say, And to seeds (descendants, heirs), as if referring to many persons, but, And to your Seed (your Descendant, your Heir), obviously referring to one individual, Who is [none other than] Christ (the Messiah). 













###### 17 






This is my argument: The Law, which began 430 years after the covenant [concerning the coming Messiah], does not _and_ cannot annul the covenant previously established (ratified) by God, so as to abolish the promise _and_ make it void. 













###### 18 






For if the inheritance [of the promise depends on observing] the Law [as these false teachers would like you to believe], it no longer [depends] on the promise; however, God gave it to Abraham [as a free gift solely] by virtue of His promise. 













###### 19 






What then was the purpose of the Law? It was added [later on, after the promise, to disclose and expose to men their guilt] because of transgressions _and_ [to make men more conscious of the sinfulness] of sin; and it was intended to be in effect until the Seed (the Descendant, the Heir) should come, to _and_ concerning Whom the promise had been made. And it [the Law] was arranged _and_ ordained _and_ appointed through the instrumentality of angels [and was given] by the hand (in the person) of a go-between [Moses, an intermediary person between God and man]. 













###### 20 






Now a go-between (intermediary) has to do with _and_ implies more than one party [there can be no mediator with just one person]. Yet God is [only] one Person [and He was the sole party in giving that promise to Abraham. But the Law was a contract between two, God and Israel; its validity was dependent on both]. 













###### 21 






Is the Law then contrary _and_ opposed to the promises of God? Of course not! For if a Law had been given which could confer [spiritual] life, then righteousness _and_ right standing with God would certainly have come by Law. 













###### 22 






But the Scriptures [picture all mankind as sinners] shut up _and_ imprisoned by sin, so that [the inheritance, blessing] which was promised through faith in Jesus Christ (the Messiah) might be given (released, delivered, and committed) to [all] those who believe [who adhere to and trust in and rely on Him]. 













###### 23 






Now before the faith came, we were perpetually guarded under the Law, kept in custody in preparation for the faith that was destined to be revealed (unveiled, disclosed), 













###### 24 






So that the Law served [^a][to us Jews] as our trainer [our guardian, our guide to Christ, to lead us] until Christ [came], that we might be justified (declared righteous, put in right standing with God) by _and_ through faith. 













###### 25 






But now that the faith has come, we are no longer under a trainer (the guardian of our childhood). 













###### 26 






For in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God through faith. 













###### 27 






For as many [of you] as were baptized into Christ [into a spiritual union and communion with Christ, the Anointed One, the Messiah] have put on (clothed yourselves with) Christ. 













###### 28 






There is [now no distinction] neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is not male [^b]and female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. 













###### 29 






And if you belong to Christ [are in Him Who is Abraham's Seed], then you are Abraham's offspring and [spiritual] heirs according to promise.

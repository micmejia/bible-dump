# Galatians 4

***














###### 1 






Now what I mean is that as long as the inheritor (heir) is a child and under age, he does not differ from a slave, although he is the master of all the estate; 













###### 2 






But he is under guardians and administrators _or_ trustees until the date fixed by his father. 













###### 3 






So we [Jewish Christians] also, when we were minors, were kept like slaves under [the rules of the Hebrew ritual and subject to] the elementary teachings of a system of external observations _and_ regulations. 













###### 4 






But when the proper time had fully come, God sent His Son, born of a woman, born subject to [the regulations of] the Law, 













###### 5 






To purchase the freedom of (to ransom, to redeem, to atone for) those who were subject to the Law, that we might be adopted _and_ have sonship conferred upon us [and be recognized as God's sons]. 













###### 6 






And because you [really] are [His] sons, God has sent the [Holy] Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba (Father)! Father! 













###### 7 






Therefore, you are no longer a slave (bond servant) but a son; and if a son, then [it follows that you are] an heir by the aid of God, _through Christ_. 













###### 8 






But at that previous time, when you had not come to be acquainted with _and_ understand _and_ know the true God, you [Gentiles] were in bondage to gods who by their very nature could not be gods at all [gods that really did not exist]. 













###### 9 






Now, however, that you have come to be acquainted with _and_ understand _and_ know [the true] God, or rather to be understood _and_ known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and beggarly _and_ worthless elementary things [of all religions before Christ came], whose slaves you once more want to become? 













###### 10 






You observe [particular] days and months and seasons and years! 













###### 11 






I am alarmed [about you], lest I have labored among _and_ over you to no purpose _and_ in vain. 













###### 12 






Brethren, I beg of you, become as I am [free from the bondage of Jewish ritualism and ordinances], for I also have become as you are [a Gentile]. You did me no wrong [in the days when I first came to you; do not do it now]. 













###### 13 






On the contrary, you know that it was on account of a bodily ailment that [I remained and] preached the Gospel to you the first time. 













###### 14 






And [yet] although my physical condition was [such] a trial to you, you did not regard it with contempt, or scorn _and_ loathe _and_ reject me; but you received me as an angel of God, [even] as Christ Jesus [Himself]! 













###### 15 






What has become of that blessed enjoyment _and_ satisfaction _and_ self-congratulation that once was yours [in what I taught you and in your regard for me]? For I bear you witness that you would have torn out your own eyes and have given them to me [to replace mine], if that were possible. 













###### 16 






Have I then become your enemy by telling the truth to you _and_ dealing sincerely with you? 













###### 17 






These men [the Judaizing teachers] are zealously trying to dazzle you [paying court to you, making much of you], but their purpose is not honorable _or_ worthy _or_ for any good. What they want to do is to isolate you [from us who oppose them], so that they may win you over to their side _and_ get you to court their favor. 













###### 18 






It is always a fine thing [of course] to be zealously sought after [as you are, provided that it is] for a good purpose _and_ done by reason of purity of heart and life, and not just when I am present with you! 













###### 19 






My little children, for whom I am again suffering birth pangs until Christ is completely _and_ permanently formed (molded) within you, 













###### 20 






Would that I were with you now and could coax you vocally, for I am fearful _and_ perplexed about you! 













###### 21 






Tell me, you who are bent on being under the Law, will you listen to what the Law [really] says? 













###### 22 






For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the bondmaid and one by the free woman. 













###### 23 






But whereas the child of the slave woman was born according to the flesh _and_ had an ordinary birth, the son of the free woman was born in fulfillment of the promise. 













###### 24 






Now all this is an allegory; these [two women] represent two covenants. One covenant originated from Mount Sinai [where the Law was given] and bears [children destined] for slavery; this is Hagar. 













###### 25 






Now Hagar is (stands for) Mount Sinai in Arabia and she corresponds to _and_ belongs in the same category with the present Jerusalem, for she is in bondage together with her children. 













###### 26 






But the Jerusalem above (the Messianic kingdom of Christ) is free, and she is our mother. 













###### 27 






For it is written in the Scriptures, Rejoice, O barren woman, who has not given birth to children; break forth into a joyful shout, you who are not feeling birth pangs, for the desolate woman has many more children than she who has a husband. 













###### 28 






But we, brethren, are children [not by physical descent, as was Ishmael, but] like Isaac, born in virtue of promise. 













###### 29 






Yet [just] as at that time the child [of ordinary birth] born according to the flesh despised _and_ persecuted him [who was born remarkably] according to [the promise and the working of] the [Holy] Spirit, so it is now also. 













###### 30 






But what does the Scripture say? Cast out _and_ send away the slave woman and her son, for never shall the son of the slave woman be heir _and_ share the inheritance with the son of the free woman. 













###### 31 






So, brethren, we [who are born again] are not children of a slave woman [the natural], but of the free [the supernatural].

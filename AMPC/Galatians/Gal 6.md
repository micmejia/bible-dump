# Galatians 6

***














###### 1 






Brethren, if any person is overtaken in misconduct _or_ sin of any sort, you who are spiritual [who are responsive to and controlled by the Spirit] should set him right _and_ restore _and_ reinstate him, without any sense of superiority _and_ with all gentleness, keeping an attentive eye on yourself, lest you should be tempted also. 













###### 2 






Bear (endure, carry) one another's burdens _and_ [^a]troublesome moral faults, and in this way fulfill _and_ observe perfectly the law of Christ (the Messiah) _and_ complete [^b]what is lacking [in your obedience to it]. 













###### 3 






For if any person thinks himself to be somebody [too important to condescend to shoulder another's load] when he is nobody [of superiority except in his own estimation], he deceives _and_ deludes _and_ cheats himself. 













###### 4 






But let every person carefully scrutinize _and_ examine _and_ test his own conduct _and_ his own work. He can then have the personal satisfaction _and_ joy of doing something commendable [[^c]in itself alone] without [resorting to] boastful comparison with his neighbor. 













###### 5 






For every person will have to bear ([^d]be equal to understanding and calmly receive) his own [[^e]little] load [^f][of oppressive faults]. 













###### 6 






Let him who receives instruction in the Word [of God] share all good things with his teacher [contributing to his support]. 













###### 7 






Do not be deceived _and_ deluded _and_ misled; God will not allow Himself to be sneered at (scorned, disdained, or mocked [^g]by mere pretensions or professions, or by His precepts being set aside.) [He inevitably deludes himself who attempts to delude God.] For whatever a man sows, that _and_ [^h]that only is what he will reap. 













###### 8 






For he who sows to his own flesh (lower nature, sensuality) will from the flesh reap decay _and_ ruin _and_ destruction, but he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life. 













###### 9 






And let us not lose heart _and_ grow weary _and_ faint in acting nobly _and_ doing right, for in due time _and_ at the appointed season we shall reap, if we do not loosen _and_ relax our courage _and_ faint. 













###### 10 






So then, as occasion _and_ opportunity open up to us, let us do good [[^i]morally] to all people [not only [^j]being useful or profitable to them, but also doing what is for their spiritual good and advantage]. Be mindful to be a blessing, especially to those of the household of faith [those who belong to God's family with you, the believers]. 













###### 11 






See with what large letters I am writing with my own hand. [[^k]Mark carefully these closing words of mine.] 













###### 12 






Those who want to make a good impression _and_ a fine show in the flesh would try to compel you to receive circumcision, simply so that they may escape being persecuted for allegiance to the cross of Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One). 













###### 13 






For even the circumcised [Jews] themselves do not [really] keep the Law, but they want to have you circumcised in order that they may glory in your flesh (your subjection to external rites). 













###### 14 






But far be it from me to glory [in anything or anyone] except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) through Whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world! 













###### 15 






For neither is circumcision [now] of any importance, nor uncircumcision, but [only] a new creation [the result of a new birth and a new nature in Christ Jesus, the Messiah]. 













###### 16 






Peace and mercy be upon all who walk by this rule [who discipline themselves and regulate their lives by this principle], even upon the [true] Israel of God! 













###### 17 






From now on let no person trouble me [by [^l]making it necessary for me to vindicate my apostolic authority and the divine truth of my Gospel], for I bear on my body the [brand] marks of the Lord Jesus [the wounds, scars, and other outward evidence of persecutions--these testify to His ownership of me]! 













###### 18 






The grace (spiritual favor, blessing) of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Anointed One, the Messiah) be with your spirit, brethren. Amen (so be it). ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

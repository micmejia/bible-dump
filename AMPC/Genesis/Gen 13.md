# Genesis 13

***














###### 1 






So Abram went up out of Egypt, he and his wife and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the South [country of Judah, the Negeb]. 













###### 2 






Now Abram was extremely rich in livestock and in silver and in gold. 













###### 3 






And he journeyed on from the South [country of Judah, the Negeb] as far as Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai, 













###### 4 






Where he had built an altar at first; and there Abram called on the name of the Lord. 













###### 5 






But Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents. 













###### 6 






Now the land was not able to nourish _and_ support them so they could dwell together, for their possessions were too great for them to live together. 













###### 7 






And there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram's cattle and the herdsmen of Lot's cattle. And the Canaanite and the Perizzite were dwelling then in the land [making fodder more difficult to obtain]. 













###### 8 






So Abram said to Lot, Let there be no strife, I beg of you, between you and me, or between your herdsmen and my herdsmen, for we are relatives. 













###### 9 






Is not the whole land before you? Separate yourself, I beg of you, from me. If you take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if you choose the right hand, then I will go to the left. 













###### 10 






And Lot looked and saw that everywhere the Jordan Valley was well watered. Before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, [it was all] like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, as you go to Zoar. 













###### 11 






Then Lot chose for himself all the Jordan Valley and [he] traveled east. So they separated. 













###### 12 






Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the [Jordan] Valley and moved his tent as far as Sodom _and_ dwelt there. 













###### 13 






But the men of Sodom were wicked and exceedingly great sinners against the Lord. 













###### 14 






The Lord said to Abram after Lot had left him, Lift up now your eyes and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward; 













###### 15 






For all the land which you see I will give to you and to your posterity forever. 













###### 16 






And I will make your descendants like the dust of the earth, so that if a man could count the dust of the earth, then could your descendants also be counted. 













###### 17 






Arise, walk through the land, the length of it and the breadth of it, for I will give it to you. 













###### 18 






Then Abram moved his tent and came and dwelt among the oaks _or_ terebinths of Mamre, which are at Hebron, and built there an altar to the Lord.

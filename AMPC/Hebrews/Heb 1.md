# Hebrews 1

***


###### 1 


In many separate revelations [each of which set forth a portion of the Truth] and in different ways God spoke of old to [our] forefathers in _and_ by the prophets, 


###### 2 


[But] in the last of these days He has spoken to us in [the person of a] Son, Whom He appointed Heir _and_ lawful Owner of all things, also by _and_ through Whom He created the worlds _and_ the reaches of space _and_ the ages of time [He made, produced, built, operated, and arranged them in order]. 


###### 3 


He is the sole expression of the glory of God [the Light-being, the out-raying or radiance of the divine], and He is the perfect imprint _and_ very image of [God's] nature, upholding _and_ maintaining _and_ guiding _and_ propelling the universe by His mighty word of power. When He had _by offering Himself_ accomplished _our_ cleansing of sins _and_ riddance of guilt, He sat down at the right hand of the divine Majesty on high, 


###### 4 


[Taking a place and rank by which] He Himself became as much superior to angels as the glorious Name (title) which He has inherited is different from _and_ more excellent than theirs. 


###### 5 


For to which of the angels did [God] ever say, You are My Son, today I have begotten You [established You in an official Sonship relation, with kingly dignity]? And again, I will be to Him a Father, and He will be to Me a Son? 


###### 6 


Moreover, when He brings the firstborn Son again into the habitable world, He says, Let all the angels of God worship Him. 


###### 7 


Referring to the angels He says, [God] Who makes His angels winds and His ministering servants flames of fire; 


###### 8 


But as to the Son, He says to Him, Your throne, O God, is forever and ever (to the ages of the ages), and the scepter of Your kingdom is a scepter of absolute righteousness (of justice and straightforwardness). 


###### 9 


You have loved righteousness [You have delighted in integrity, virtue, and uprightness in purpose, thought, and action] and You have hated lawlessness (injustice and iniquity). Therefore God, [even] Your God (Godhead), has anointed You with the oil of exultant joy _and_ gladness above _and_ beyond Your companions. 


###### 10 


And [further], You, Lord, did lay the foundation of the earth in the beginning, and the heavens are the works of Your hands. 


###### 11 


They will perish, but You remain _and_ continue permanently; they will all grow old _and_ wear out like a garment. 


###### 12 


Like a mantle [thrown about one's self] You will roll them up, and they will be changed _and_ replaced by others. But You remain the same, and Your years will never end _nor_ come to failure. 


###### 13 


Besides, to which of the angels has He ever said, Sit at My right hand [associated with Me in My royal dignity] till I make your enemies a stool for your feet? 


###### 14 


Are not the angels all ministering spirits (servants) sent out in the service [of God for the assistance] of those who are to inherit salvation?

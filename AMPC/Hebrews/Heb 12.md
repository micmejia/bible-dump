# Hebrews 12

***


###### 1 


Therefore then, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses [who have borne testimony to the Truth], let us strip off _and_ throw aside every encumbrance (unnecessary weight) and that sin which so readily (deftly and cleverly) clings to _and_ entangles us, and let us run with patient endurance _and_ steady _and_ active persistence the appointed course of the race that is set before us, 


###### 2 


Looking away [from all that will distract] to Jesus, Who is the Leader _and_ the Source of our faith [giving the first incentive for our belief] and is also its Finisher [bringing it to maturity and perfection]. He, for the joy [of obtaining the prize] that was set before Him, endured the cross, despising _and_ ignoring the shame, and is now seated at the right hand of the throne of God. 


###### 3 


Just think of Him Who endured from sinners such grievous opposition _and_ bitter hostility against Himself [reckon up and consider it all in comparison with your trials], so that you may not grow weary _or_ exhausted, losing heart _and_ relaxing _and_ fainting in your minds. 


###### 4 


You have not yet struggled _and_ fought agonizingly against sin, _nor_ have you yet resisted _and_ withstood to the point of pouring out your [own] blood. 


###### 5 


And have you [completely] forgotten the divine word of appeal _and_ encouragement in which you are reasoned with _and_ addressed as sons? My son, do not think lightly _or_ scorn to submit to the correction _and_ discipline of the Lord, nor lose courage _and_ give up _and_ faint when you are reproved _or_ corrected by Him; 


###### 6 


For the Lord corrects _and_ disciplines everyone whom He loves, and He punishes, even scourges, every son whom He accepts _and_ welcomes to His heart _and_ cherishes. 


###### 7 


You must submit to _and_ endure [correction] for discipline; God is dealing with you as with sons. For what son is there whom his father does not [thus] train _and_ correct _and_ discipline? 


###### 8 


Now if you are exempt from correction _and_ left without discipline in which all [of God's children] share, then you are illegitimate offspring _and_ not true sons [at all]. 


###### 9 


Moreover, we have had earthly fathers who disciplined us and we yielded [to them] _and_ respected [them for training us]. Shall we not much more cheerfully submit to the Father of spirits and so [truly] live? 


###### 10 


For [our earthly fathers] disciplined us for only a short period of time _and_ chastised us as seemed proper _and_ good to them; but He disciplines us for our certain good, that we may become sharers in His own holiness. 


###### 11 


For the time being no discipline brings joy, but seems grievous _and_ painful; but afterwards it yields a peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it [a harvest of fruit which consists in righteousness--in conformity to God's will in purpose, thought, and action, resulting in right living and right standing with God]. 


###### 12 


So then, brace up _and_ reinvigorate _and_ set right your slackened _and_ weakened _and_ drooping hands and strengthen your feeble _and_ palsied _and_ tottering knees, 


###### 13 


And cut through _and_ make firm _and_ plain _and_ smooth, straight paths for your feet [yes, make them safe and upright and happy paths that go in the right direction], so that the lame _and_ halting [limbs] may not be put out of joint, but rather may be cured. 


###### 14 


Strive to live in peace with everybody and pursue that consecration _and_ holiness without which no one will [ever] see the Lord. 


###### 15 


Exercise foresight _and_ be on the watch to look [after one another], to see that no one falls back from _and_ fails to secure God's grace (His unmerited favor and spiritual blessing), in order that no root of resentment (rancor, bitterness, or hatred) shoots forth and causes trouble _and_ bitter torment, and the many become contaminated _and_ defiled by it-- 


###### 16 


That no one may become guilty of sexual vice, or become a profane (godless and sacrilegious) person as Esau did, who sold his own birthright for a single meal. 


###### 17 


For you understand that later on, when he wanted [to regain title to] his inheritance of the blessing, he was rejected (disqualified and set aside), for he could find no opportunity to repair by repentance [what he had done, no chance to recall the choice he had made], although he sought for it carefully with [bitter] tears. 


###### 18 


For you have not come [as did the Israelites in the wilderness] to a [material] mountain that can be touched, [a mountain] that is ablaze with fire, and to gloom and darkness and a raging storm, 


###### 19 


And to the blast of a trumpet and a voice whose words make the listeners beg that nothing more be said to them. 


###### 20 


For they could not bear the command that was given: If even a wild animal touches the mountain, it shall be stoned to death. 


###### 21 


In fact, so awful _and_ terrifying was the [phenomenal] sight that Moses said, I am terrified (aghast and trembling with fear). 


###### 22 


But rather, you have come to Mount Zion, even to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to countless multitudes of angels in festal gathering, 


###### 23 


And to the church (assembly) of the Firstborn who are registered [as citizens] in heaven, and to the God Who is Judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous (the redeemed in heaven) who have been made perfect, 


###### 24 


And to Jesus, the Mediator (Go-between, Agent) of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood which speaks [of mercy], a better _and_ nobler _and_ more gracious message than the blood of Abel [which cried out for vengeance]. 


###### 25 


So see to it that you do not reject Him _or_ refuse to listen to _and_ heed Him Who is speaking [to you now]. For if they [the Israelites] did not escape when they refused to listen _and_ heed Him Who warned _and_ divinely instructed them [here] on earth [revealing with heavenly warnings His will], how much less shall we escape if we reject _and_ turn our backs on Him Who cautions _and_ admonishes [us] from heaven? 


###### 26 


Then [at Mount Sinai] His voice shook the earth, but now He has given a promise: Yet once more I will shake _and_ make tremble not only the earth but also the [starry] heavens. 


###### 27 


Now this expression, Yet once more, indicates the final removal _and_ transformation of all [that can be] shaken--that is, of that which has been created--in order that what cannot be shaken may remain _and_ continue. 


###### 28 


Let us therefore, receiving a kingdom that is firm _and_ stable _and_ cannot be shaken, offer to God pleasing service _and_ acceptable worship, with modesty _and_ pious care and godly fear _and_ awe; 


###### 29 


For our God [is indeed] a consuming fire.

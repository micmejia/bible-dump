# Hebrews 13

***














###### 1 






Let love for your fellow believers continue _and_ be a fixed practice with you [never let it fail]. 













###### 2 






Do not forget _or_ neglect _or_ refuse to extend hospitality to strangers [in the brotherhood--being friendly, cordial, and gracious, sharing the comforts of your home and doing your part generously], for through it some have entertained angels without knowing it. 













###### 3 






Remember those who are in prison as if you were their fellow prisoner, and those who are ill-treated, since you also are liable to bodily sufferings. 













###### 4 






Let marriage be held in honor (esteemed worthy, precious, of great price, and especially dear) in all things. And thus let the marriage bed be undefiled (kept undishonored); for God will judge _and_ punish the unchaste [all guilty of sexual vice] and adulterous. 













###### 5 






Let your [^a]character _or_ moral disposition be free from love of money [including greed, avarice, lust, and craving for earthly possessions] and be satisfied with your present [circumstances and with what you have]; for He [God] [^b]Himself has said, I will not in any way fail you _nor_ [^c]give you up _nor_ leave you without support. [I will] not, [^d][I will] not, [I will] not in any degree leave you helpless _nor_ forsake _nor_ [^e]let [you] down ([^f]relax My hold on you)! [[^g]Assuredly not!] 













###### 6 






So we take comfort _and_ are encouraged _and_ confidently _and_ boldly say, The Lord is my Helper; I will not be seized with alarm [I will not fear or dread or be terrified]. What can man do to me? 













###### 7 






Remember your leaders _and_ superiors in authority [for it was they] who brought to you the Word of God. Observe attentively _and_ consider their manner of living (the outcome of their well-spent lives) and imitate their faith ([^h]their conviction that God exists and is the Creator and Ruler of all things, the Provider and Bestower of eternal salvation through Christ, and their [^i]leaning of the entire human personality on God in absolute trust and confidence in His power, wisdom, and goodness). 













###### 8 






Jesus Christ (the Messiah) is [always] the same, yesterday, today, [yes] and forever (to the ages). 













###### 9 






Do not be carried about by different _and_ varied and alien teachings; for it is good for the heart to be established _and_ ennobled _and_ strengthened by means of grace (God's favor and spiritual blessing) and not [to be devoted to] foods [rules of diet and ritualistic meals], which bring no [spiritual] benefit _or_ profit to those who observe them. 













###### 10 






We have an altar from which those who serve _and_ [^j]worship in the tabernacle have no right to eat. 













###### 11 






For when the blood of animals is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest as a sacrifice for sin, the victims' bodies are burned outside the limits of the camp. 













###### 12 






Therefore Jesus also suffered _and_ died outside the [city's] gate in order that He might purify _and_ consecrate the people through [the shedding of] His own blood _and_ set them apart as holy [for God]. 













###### 13 






Let us then go forth [from all that would prevent us] to Him outside the camp [at Calvary], bearing the contempt _and_ abuse _and_ shame with Him. 













###### 14 






For here we have no permanent city, but we are looking for the one which is to come. 













###### 15 






Through Him, therefore, let us constantly _and_ at all times offer up to God a sacrifice of praise, which is the fruit of lips that thankfully acknowledge _and_ confess _and_ glorify His name. 













###### 16 






Do not forget _or_ neglect to do kindness _and_ good, to be generous _and_ distribute _and_ contribute to the needy [of the church [^k]as embodiment and proof of fellowship], for such sacrifices are pleasing to God. 













###### 17 






Obey your spiritual leaders and submit to them [continually recognizing their authority over you], for they are constantly keeping watch over your souls _and_ guarding your spiritual welfare, as men who will have to render an account [of their trust]. [Do your part to] let them do this with gladness and not with sighing _and_ groaning, for that would not be profitable to you [either]. 













###### 18 






Keep praying for us, for we are convinced that we have a good (clear) conscience, that we want to walk uprightly _and_ live a noble life, acting honorably _and_ in complete honesty in all things. 













###### 19 






And I beg of you [to pray for us] the more earnestly, in order that I may be restored to you the sooner. 













###### 20 






Now may the God of peace [Who is the Author and the Giver of peace], Who brought again from among the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep, by the blood [that sealed, ratified] the everlasting agreement (covenant, testament), 













###### 21 






Strengthen (complete, perfect) _and_ make you what you ought to be _and_ equip you with everything good that you may carry out His will; [while He Himself] works in you _and_ accomplishes that which is pleasing in His sight, through Jesus Christ (the Messiah); to Whom be the glory forever and ever (to the ages of the ages). Amen (so be it). 













###### 22 






I call on you, brethren, to listen patiently _and_ bear with this message of exhortation _and_ admonition _and_ encouragement, for I have written to you briefly. 













###### 23 






Notice that our brother Timothy has been released [from prison]. If he comes here soon, I will see you along with him. 













###### 24 






Give our greetings to all of your spiritual leaders and to all of the saints (God's consecrated believers). The Italian Christians send you their greetings [also]. 













###### 25 






Grace (God's favor and spiritual blessing) be with you all. _Amen (so be it)._

# Hebrews 2

***














###### 1 






Since all this is true, we ought to pay much closer attention than ever to the truths that we have heard, lest in any way we drift past [them] _and_ slip away. 













###### 2 






For if the message given through angels [the Law spoken by them to Moses] was authentic _and_ proved sure, and every violation and disobedience received an appropriate (just and adequate) penalty, 













###### 3 






How shall we escape [appropriate retribution] if we neglect _and_ refuse to pay attention to such a great salvation [as is now offered to us, letting it drift past us forever]? For it was declared at first by the Lord [Himself], and it was confirmed to us _and_ proved to be real _and_ genuine by those who personally heard [Him speak]. 













###### 4 






[Besides this evidence] it was also established _and_ plainly endorsed by God, Who showed His approval of it by signs and wonders and various miraculous manifestations of [His] power and by imparting the gifts of the Holy Spirit [to the believers] according to His own will. 













###### 5 






For it was not to angels that God subjected the habitable world of the future, of which we are speaking. 













###### 6 






It has been solemnly _and_ earnestly said in a certain place, What is man that You are mindful of him, or the son of man that You graciously _and_ helpfully care for _and_ visit _and_ look after him? 













###### 7 






For some little time You have ranked him lower than _and_ inferior to the angels; You have crowned him with glory and honor _and set him over the works of Your hands_, 













###### 8 






For You have put everything in subjection under his feet. Now in putting everything in subjection to man, He left nothing outside [of man's] control. But at present we do not yet see all things subjected to him [man]. 













###### 9 






But we are able to see Jesus, Who was ranked lower than the angels for a little while, crowned with glory and honor because of His having suffered death, in order that by the grace (unmerited favor) of God [to us sinners] He might experience death for every individual person. 













###### 10 






For it was an act worthy [of God] _and_ fitting [to the divine nature] that He, for Whose sake and by Whom all things have their existence, in bringing many sons into glory, should make the Pioneer of their salvation perfect [should bring to maturity the human experience necessary to be perfectly equipped for His office as High Priest] through suffering. 













###### 11 






For both He Who sanctifies [making men holy] and those who are sanctified all have one [Father]. For this reason He is not ashamed to call them brethren; 













###### 12 






For He says, I will declare Your [the Father's] name to My brethren; in the midst of the [worshiping] congregation I will sing hymns of praise to You. 













###### 13 






And again He says, My trust _and_ assured reliance _and_ confident hope shall be fixed in Him. And yet again, Here I am, I and the children whom God has given Me. 













###### 14 






Since, therefore, [these His] children share in flesh and blood [in the physical nature of human beings], He [Himself] in a similar manner partook of the same [nature], that by [going through] death He might bring to nought _and_ make of no effect him who had the power of death--that is, the devil-- 













###### 15 






And also that He might deliver _and_ completely set free all those who through the [haunting] fear of death were held in bondage throughout the whole course of their lives. 













###### 16 






For, as we all know, He [Christ] did not take hold of angels [[^a]the fallen angels, to give them a helping and delivering hand], but He did take hold of [[^b]the fallen] descendants of Abraham [to reach out to them a helping and delivering hand]. 













###### 17 






So it is evident that it was essential that He be made like His brethren in every respect, in order that He might become a merciful (sympathetic) and faithful High Priest in the things related to God, to make atonement _and_ propitiation for the people's sins. 













###### 18 






For because He Himself [in His humanity] has suffered in being tempted (tested and tried), He is able [immediately] [^c]to run to the cry of (assist, relieve) those who are being tempted _and_ tested _and_ tried [and who therefore are being exposed to suffering].

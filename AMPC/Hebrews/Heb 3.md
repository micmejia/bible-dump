# Hebrews 3

***


###### 1 


So then, brethren, consecrated _and_ set apart for God, who share in the heavenly calling, [thoughtfully and attentively] consider Jesus, the Apostle and High Priest Whom we confessed [as ours when we embraced the Christian faith]. 


###### 2 


[See how] faithful He was to Him Who appointed Him [Apostle and High Priest], as Moses was also faithful in the whole house [of God]. 


###### 3 


Yet Jesus has been considered worthy of much greater honor _and_ glory than Moses, just as the builder of a house has more honor than the house [itself]. 


###### 4 


For [of course] every house is built _and_ furnished by someone, but the Builder of all things _and_ the Furnisher [of the entire equipment of all things] is God. 


###### 5 


And Moses certainly was faithful in the administration of all God's house [but it was only] as a ministering servant. [In his entire ministry he was but] a testimony to the things which were to be spoken [the revelations to be given afterward in Christ]. 


###### 6 


But Christ (the Messiah) was faithful over His [own Father's] house as a Son [and Master of it]. And it is we who are [now members] of this house, if we hold _fast and firm to the end_ our joyful _and_ exultant confidence and sense of triumph in our hope [in Christ]. 


###### 7 


Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says: Today, if you will hear His voice, 


###### 8 


Do not harden your hearts, as [happened] in the rebellion [of Israel] _and_ their provocation _and_ embitterment [of Me] in the day of testing in the wilderness, 


###### 9 


Where your fathers tried [My patience] _and_ tested [My forbearance] and found I stood their test, and they saw My works for forty years. 


###### 10 


And so I was provoked (displeased and sorely grieved) with that generation, and said, They always err _and_ are led astray in their hearts, and they have not perceived _or_ recognized My ways _and_ become progressively better _and_ more experimentally _and_ intimately acquainted with them. 


###### 11 


Accordingly, I swore in My wrath _and_ indignation, They shall not enter into My rest. 


###### 12 


[Therefore beware] brethren, take care, lest there be in any one of you a wicked, unbelieving heart [which refuses to cleave to, trust in, and rely on Him], leading you to turn away _and_ desert _or_ stand aloof from the living God. 


###### 13 


But instead warn (admonish, urge, and encourage) one another every day, as long as it is called Today, that none of you may be hardened [into settled rebellion] by the deceitfulness of sin [by the fraudulence, the stratagem, the trickery which the delusive glamor of his sin may play on him]. 


###### 14 


For we have become fellows with Christ (the Messiah) _and_ share in all He has for us, if only we hold our first newborn confidence _and_ original assured expectation [in virtue of which we are believers] firm _and_ unshaken to the end. 


###### 15 


Then while it is [still] called Today, if you would hear His voice _and_ when you hear it, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion [in the desert, when the people provoked and irritated and embittered God against them]. 


###### 16 


For who were they who heard _and_ yet were rebellious _and_ provoked [Him]? Was it not all those who came out of Egypt led by Moses? 


###### 17 


And with whom was He irritated _and_ provoked _and_ grieved for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose dismembered bodies were strewn _and_ left in the desert? 


###### 18 


And to whom did He swear that they should not enter His rest, but to those who disobeyed [who had not listened to His word and who refused to be compliant or be persuaded]? 


###### 19 


So we see that they were not able to enter [into His rest], because of their unwillingness to adhere to _and_ trust in _and_ rely on God [unbelief had shut them out].

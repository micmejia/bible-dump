# Hosea 10

***














###### 1 






Israel is a luxuriant vine that puts forth its [material] fruit. According to the abundance of his fruit he has multiplied his altars [to idols]; according to the goodness _and_ prosperity of their land they have made goodly pillars _or_ obelisks [to false gods]. 













###### 2 






Their heart is divided _and_ deceitful; now shall they be found guilty _and_ suffer punishment. The Lord will smite _and_ break down [the horns of] their altars; He will destroy their [idolatrous] pillars. 













###### 3 






Surely now they shall say, We have no [actual] king because we fear not the Lord; and as for the king, what can he do for us? 













###### 4 






They have spoken mere words of the lips, swearing falsely in making covenants; therefore judgment springs up like hemlock [or other poisonous plants] in the furrows of the field. 













###### 5 






The inhabitants of Samaria shall be in terror for the calf [idol] of Beth-aven [the house of idolatry, contemptuously meaning Bethel], for its people shall mourn over it and its [idolatrous] priests who rejoiced over it [shall tremble] for the glory of [their calf god], because it is departed from it. 













###### 6 






[The golden calf] shall also be carried into Assyria as a tribute-gift to the fighting King Jareb; Ephraim shall be put to shame and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel [to set up calf worship and detach Israel from Judah]. 













###### 7 






As for Samaria, her king _and_ her whole monarchy are cut off like twigs _or_ foam upon the water. 













###### 8 






The high places also of Aven [once Beth(el), house of God, now (Beth-)aven, house of idolatry], the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed; the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their [idol] altars, and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us! And to the hills, Fall on us! 













###### 9 






O Israel, you have [willfully] sinned from the days of Gibeah [when you all but wiped out the tribe of Benjamin]! There [Israel] stood [then, only] that the battle against the sons of unrighteousness might not overtake _and_ turn against them at Gibeah [but now the kingdom of the ten tribes and the name of Ephraim shall be utterly blotted out]. 













###### 10 






When I please I will chastise them, and hostile peoples shall be gathered against them when I shall bind _and_ yoke them for their two transgressions [revolt from the Lord their God and the worship of idols]. 













###### 11 






Ephraim indeed is a heifer broken in _and_ loving to tread out the grain, but I have [heretofore] spared the beauty of her fair neck. I will now set a rider upon Ephraim _and_ make him to draw; Judah shall plow and Jacob shall break his clods. 













###### 12 






Sow for yourselves according to righteousness (uprightness and right standing with God); reap according to mercy _and_ loving-kindness. Break up your uncultivated ground, for it is time to seek the Lord, to inquire for _and_ of Him, _and_ to require His favor, till He comes and teaches you righteousness _and_ rains His righteous gift of salvation upon you. 













###### 13 






You have plowed _and_ plotted wickedness, you have reaped the [willful] injustice [of oppressors], you have eaten the fruit of lies. Because you have trusted in your [own] way _and_ your chariots, in the multitude of your mighty men, 













###### 14 






Therefore shall a tumult arise against your people and all your fortresses shall be wasted _and_ destroyed, as Shalmaneser wasted _and_ destroyed Beth-arbel on the day of battle; the mother was dashed in pieces with her children. 













###### 15 






So shall it be done to you at [idolatrous] Bethel because of your great wickedness; at daybreak shall the king of Israel be utterly cut off.

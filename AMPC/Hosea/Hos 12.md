# Hosea 12

***














###### 1 






Ephraim herds _and_ feeds on the wind and pursues the [parching] east wind; every day he increases lies and violence, and a covenant is made with Assyria and oil is carried to Egypt. 













###### 2 






The Lord has also a controversy (a pleading contention) with Judah, and will punish Jacob by visiting upon him according to his ways; according to his doings will He recompense him. 













###### 3 






He took his brother by the heel in [their mother's] womb, and in the strength [of his manhood] he contended _and_ had power with God. 













###### 4 






Yes, he had power over the [^a]Angel [of the Lord] and prevailed; he wept and sought His favor. He met Him in Bethel, and there [God] spoke with [him and through him with] us-- 













###### 5 






Even the Lord the God of hosts, the name of Him [Who spoke with Jacob] is the Lord. 













###### 6 






Therefore return to your God! Hold fast to love _and_ mercy, to righteousness _and_ justice, and wait [expectantly] for your God continually! 













###### 7 






Canaan [Israel--whose ideals have sunk to those of Canaan] is a trader; the balances of deceit are in his hand; he loves to oppress _and_ defraud. 













###### 8 






Ephraim has said, Ah, but I have become rich; I have gained for myself wealth. All my profits shall bring on me no iniquity that would be sin. [But all his profits will never offset nor suffice to expiate the guilt which he has incurred.] 













###### 9 






But I [Who] am the Lord your God from [when you became a nation in] the land of Egypt will yet make you to dwell in tents, as in the days of the appointed _and_ solemn Feast [of Tabernacles]. 













###### 10 






I have also spoken to [you by] the prophets, and I have multiplied visions [for you] and [have appealed to you] through parables acted out by the prophets. 













###### 11 






If Gilead is given over to idolatry, they shall come to nought _and_ be mere waste; if they [insult God by] sacrificing bullocks in Gilgal [on heathen altars], their altars shall be like heaps in the furrows of the fields. 













###### 12 






Jacob fled into the open country of Aram _or_ Padan-aram, and [there] Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he herded sheep. 













###### 13 






And by a prophet the Lord brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet was [Israel] preserved. 













###### 14 






Ephraim has provoked most bitter anger; therefore shall his blood [guilt] be left upon him, and his disgrace _and_ reproach shall his Lord return upon him.

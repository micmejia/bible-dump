# Hosea 6

***














###### 1 






Come and let us return to the Lord, for He has torn so that He may heal us; He has stricken so that He may bind us up. 













###### 2 






After two days He will revive us (quicken us, give us life); on the third day He will raise us up that we may live before Him. 













###### 3 






Yes, let us know (recognize, be acquainted with, and understand) Him; let us be zealous to know the Lord [to appreciate, give heed to, and cherish Him]. His going forth is prepared _and_ certain as the dawn, and He will come to us as the [heavy] rain, as the latter rain that waters the earth.

###### 8 






Gilead is a city of evildoers; it is tracked with bloody [footprints]. 













###### 9 






And as troops of robbers lie in wait for a man, so the company of priests murder on the road toward Shechem; yes, they commit villainy _and_ outrages. 













###### 10 






I have seen a horrible thing in the house of Israel! There harlotry _and_ idolatry are found in Ephraim; Israel is defiled. 













###### 11 






Also, O Judah, there is a harvest [of divine judgment] appointed for you; when I would return My people from their captivity [in which they are slaves to the misery brought on by their own sins],

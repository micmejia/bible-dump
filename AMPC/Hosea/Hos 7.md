# Hosea 7

***














###### 1 






When I would heal Israel, then Ephraim's guilt is uncovered, and the wickedness of Samaria; how they practice falsehood, and the thief enters and the troop of bandits ravage _and_ raid without. 













###### 2 






But they do not consider _and_ say to their minds _and_ hearts that I [earnestly] remember all their wickedness. Now their own doings surround and entangle them; they are before My face. 













###### 3 






They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies. 













###### 4 






They are all [idolatrous] adulterers; their passion smolders like heat of an oven when the baker ceases to stir the fire from the kneading of the dough until it is leavened. 













###### 5 






On the [special] day of our king the princes made themselves _and_ him sick with the heat of wine; [the king] stretched out his hand with scoffers _and_ lawless men. 













###### 6 






For they have made ready their heart, _and_ their mind burns [with intrigue] like an oven while they lie in wait. Their anger smolders all night; in the morning it blazes forth as a flaming fire. 













###### 7 






They are all hot as an oven and devour their judges; all their kings are fallen; there is none among them who calls to Me. 













###### 8 






Ephraim mixes himself among the peoples [courting the favor of first one country, then another]; Ephraim is a cake not turned. 













###### 9 






Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knows it not; yes, gray hairs are sprinkled here and there upon him, and he does not know it. 













###### 10 






And the pride of Israel testifies against him _and_ to his face. But they do not return to the Lord their God, nor seek _nor_ inquire of _nor_ require Him in spite of all this. 













###### 11 






Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart _or_ understanding; they call to Egypt; they go to Assyria. 













###### 12 






As they go, I will spread My net over them; I will bring them down like birds of the heavens. I will chastise them according to the announcement [or prediction made] to their congregation [in the Scriptures]. 













###### 13 






Woe to them, for they have wandered from Me! Destruction to them, because they have rebelled _and_ trespassed against Me! Though I would redeem them, yet they have spoken lies against Me. 













###### 14 






They do not cry to Me from their heart, but they wail upon their beds; they gash _and_ distress _and_ assemble themselves [in mourning] for grain and new wine; they rebel against Me. 













###### 15 






Although I have chastened them _and_ trained and strengthened their arms, yet they think _and_ devise evil against Me. 













###### 16 






They turn back, shift, _or_ change, but not upwards [to the Most High]. They are like a deceitful bow; their princes shall fall by the sword for the insolence _and_ rage of their tongue. This shall be [cause for] their derision _and_ scorning in the land of Egypt.

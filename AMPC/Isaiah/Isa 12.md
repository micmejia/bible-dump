# Isaiah 12

***














###### 1 






And in that day you will say, I will give thanks to You, O Lord; for though You were angry with me, Your anger has turned away, and You comfort me. 













###### 2 






Behold, God, my salvation! I will trust and not be afraid, for the Lord God is my strength and song; yes, He has become my salvation. 













###### 3 






Therefore with joy will you draw water from the wells of salvation. 













###### 4 






And in that day you will say, Give thanks to the Lord, call upon His name _and_ by means of His name [in solemn entreaty]; declare _and_ make known His deeds among the peoples of the earth, proclaim that His name is exalted! 













###### 5 






Sing praises to the Lord, for He has done excellent things [gloriously]; let this be made known to all the earth. 













###### 6 






Cry aloud and shout joyfully, you women _and_ inhabitants of Zion, for great in your midst is the Holy One of Israel.

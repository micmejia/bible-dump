# Isaiah 15

***














###### 1 






The mournful, inspired prediction (a burden to be lifted up) concerning Moab: Because in a night Ar of Moab is laid waste and brought to silence! Because in a night Kir of Moab is laid waste and brought to silence! 













###### 2 






They are gone up to Bayith and to Dibon, to the high places to weep. Moab wails over Nebo and over Medeba; on all their heads is baldness, and every beard is cut off [as a sign of deep sorrow and humiliation]. 













###### 3 






In their streets they gird themselves with sackcloth; on the tops of their houses and in their broad places everyone wails, weeping abundantly. 













###### 4 






And Heshbon and Elealeh [cities in possession of Moab] cry out; their voice is heard even to Jahaz. Therefore the armed soldiers of Moab cry out; [Moab's] life is grievous _and_ trembles within him. 













###### 5 






My heart cries out for Moab; his nobles _and_ other fugitives flee to Zoar, to Eglath-shelishiyah [like a heifer three years old]. For with weeping they go up the ascent of Luhith; for on the road to Horonaim they raise a cry of destruction. 













###### 6 






For the waters of Nimrim are desolations, for the grass is withered away and the new growth fails; there is no green thing. 













###### 7 






Therefore the abundance [of possessions] they have acquired and stored away they [now] carry over the willow brook _and_ to the valley of the Arabians. 













###### 8 






For the cry [of distress] has gone round the borders of Moab; the wailing has reached to Eglaim, and the prolonged _and_ mournful cry to Beer-elim. 













###### 9 






For the waters of Dimon are full of blood; yet I [the Lord] will bring even more on Dimon--a lion upon those of Moab who escape and upon the remnant of the land. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

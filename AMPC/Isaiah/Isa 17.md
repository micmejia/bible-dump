# Isaiah 17

***














###### 1 






The mournful, inspired prediction (a burden to be lifted up) concerning Damascus [capital of Syria, and Israel's bulwark against Assyria]. Behold, Damascus will cease to be a city and will become a heap of ruins. 













###### 2 






The cities of Aroer [east of the Jordan] are forsaken; they shall be for flocks, which shall lie down, and none shall make them afraid. 













###### 3 






His bulwark [Syria] _and_ the fortress shall disappear from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus; and the remnant of Syria will be like the [departed] glory of the children of Israel [her ally], says the Lord of hosts. 













###### 4 






And in that day the former glory of Jacob [Israel--his might, his population, his prosperity] shall be enfeebled, and the fat of his flesh shall become lean. 













###### 5 






And it shall be as when the reaper gathers the standing grain and his arm harvests the ears; yes, it shall be as when one gathers the ears of grain in the fertile Valley of Rephaim. 













###### 6 






Yet gleanings [of grapes] shall be left in it [the land of Israel], as after the beating of an olive tree [with a stick], two or three berries in the top of the uppermost bough, four or five in the outermost branches of the fruitful tree, says the Lord, the God of Israel. 













###### 7 






In that day will men look to their Maker, and their eyes shall regard the Holy One of Israel. 













###### 8 






And they will not look to the [idolatrous] altars, the work of their hands, neither will they have respect for what their fingers have made--either the Asherim [symbols of the goddess Asherah] or the sun-images. 













###### 9 






In that day will their [Syria's and Israel's] strong cities be like the forsaken places in the wood and on the mountaintop, as they [the [^a]Amorites and the Hivites] forsook their [cities] because of the children of Israel; and there will be desolation. 













###### 10 






Because you have forgotten the God of your salvation [O Judah] and have not been mindful of the Rock of your strength, your Stronghold--therefore, you have planted pleasant nursery grounds _and_ plantings [to Adonis, pots of quickly withered flowers used to set by their doors or in the courts of temples], and have set [the grounds] with vine slips of a strange [God], 













###### 11 






And in the day of your planting you hedge it in, and in the morning you make your seed to blossom, yet [promising as it is] the harvest shall be a heap of ruins _and_ flee away in the day of expected possession and of desperate sorrow _and_ sickening, incurable pain. 













###### 12 






Hark, the uproar of a multitude of peoples! They roar _and_ thunder like the noise of the seas! Ah, the roar of nations! They roar like the roaring of rushing _and_ mighty waters! 













###### 13 






The nations will rush _and_ roar like the rushing _and_ roaring of many waters--but [God] will rebuke them, and they will flee far off and will be chased like chaff on the mountains before the wind, and like rolling thistledown _or_ whirling dust of the stubble before the storm. 













###### 14 






At evening time, behold, terror! And [^b]before the morning, they [the terrorizing Assyrians] are not. This is the portion of those who strip us [the Jews] of what belongs to us, and the lot of those who rob us.

[^b]: Isaiah 17:14 Isaiah foretells (in Isa. 14:25) that God will break the Assyrian conqueror and tread him underfoot. Now (in Isa. 17:14) further details seem to be furnished—“terror” (because the enemy has all but been victorious), but “before the morning, they [the terrorizing Assyrians] are not.” The startling fulfillment of this prophecy (cf. also Isa. 10:33-34; 30:31; 31:8) is found in Isa. 37:36, following the repetition of the prophecy first recorded in II Kings 19:29-36. Just when an overwhelming victory by the Assyrian Sennacherib seemed inevitable, during a single night 185,000 of his army died, and Judah was spared—as the Lord through Isaiah had promised.

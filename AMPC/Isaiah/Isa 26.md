# Isaiah 26

***














###### 1 






In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah: We have a strong city; [the Lord] sets up salvation as walls and bulwarks. 













###### 2 






Open the gates, that the [uncompromisingly] righteous nation which keeps her faith _and_ her troth [with God] may enter in. 













###### 3 






You will guard him _and_ keep him in perfect _and_ constant peace whose mind [both its inclination and its character] is stayed on You, because he commits himself to You, leans on You, _and_ hopes confidently in You. 













###### 4 






So trust in the Lord (commit yourself to Him, lean on Him, hope confidently in Him) forever; for the Lord God is an everlasting Rock [the Rock of Ages]. 













###### 5 






For He has brought down the inhabitants of the height, the lofty city; He lays it low, lays it low to the ground; He brings it even to the dust. 













###### 6 






The foot has trampled it down--even the feet of the poor, and the steps of the needy. 













###### 7 






The way of the [consistently] righteous (those living in moral and spiritual rectitude in every area and relationship of their lives) is level _and_ straight; You, O [Lord], Who are upright, direct aright _and_ make level the path of the [uncompromisingly] just _and_ righteous. 













###### 8 






Yes, in the path of Your judgments, O Lord, we wait [expectantly] for You; our heartfelt desire is for Your name and for the remembrance of You. 













###### 9 






My soul yearns for You [O Lord] in the night, yes, my spirit within me seeks You earnestly; for [only] when Your judgments are in the earth will the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness (uprightness and right standing with God). 













###### 10 






Though favor is shown to the wicked, yet they do not learn righteousness; in the land of uprightness they deal perversely and refuse to see the majesty of the Lord. 













###### 11 






Though Your hand is lifted high to strike, Lord, they do not see it. Let them see Your zeal for Your people and be ashamed; yes, let the fire reserved for Your enemies consume them. 













###### 12 






Lord, You will ordain peace (God's favor and blessings, both temporal and spiritual) for us, for You have also wrought in us _and_ for us all our works. 













###### 13 






O Lord, our God, other masters besides You have ruled over us, but we will acknowledge _and_ mention Your name only. 













###### 14 






They [the former tyrant masters] are dead, they shall not live _and_ reappear; they are powerless ghosts, they shall not rise _and_ come back. Therefore You have visited and made an end of them and caused every memory of them [every trace of their supremacy] to perish. 













###### 15 






You have increased the nation, O Lord; You have increased the nation. You are glorified; You have enlarged all the borders of the land. 













###### 16 






Lord, when they were in trouble _and_ distress, they sought _and_ visited You; they poured out a prayerful whisper when Your chastening was upon them. 













###### 17 






As a woman with child drawing near the time of her delivery is in pain _and_ writhes and cries out in her pangs, so we have been before You (at Your presence), O Lord. 













###### 18 






We have been with child, we have been writhing _and_ in pain; we have, as it were, brought forth [only] wind. We have not wrought any deliverance in the earth, and the inhabitants of the world [of Israel] have not yet been born. 













###### 19 






Your dead shall live [O Lord]; the bodies of our dead [saints] shall rise. You who dwell in the dust, awake and sing for joy! For Your dew [O Lord] is a dew of [sparkling] light [heavenly, supernatural dew]; and the earth shall cast forth the dead [to life again; for on the land of the shades of the dead You will let Your dew fall]. 













###### 20 






Come, my people, enter your chambers and shut your doors behind you; hide yourselves for a little while until the [Lord's] wrath is past. 













###### 21 






For behold, the Lord is coming out of His place [heaven] to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity; the earth also will disclose the blood shed upon her and will no longer cover her slain _and_ conceal her guilt.

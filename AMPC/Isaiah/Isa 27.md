# Isaiah 27

***














###### 1 






In that day [the Lord will deliver Israel from her enemies and also from the rebel powers of evil and darkness] His sharp _and_ unrelenting, great, and strong sword will visit _and_ punish Leviathan the swiftly fleeing serpent, Leviathan the twisting _and_ winding serpent; and He will slay the monster that is in the sea. 













###### 2 






In that day [it will be said of the redeemed nation of Israel], A vineyard beloved _and_ lovely; sing a responsive song to it _and_ about it! 













###### 3 






I, the Lord, am its Keeper; I water it every moment; lest anyone harm it, I guard _and_ keep it night and day. 













###### 4 






Wrath is not in Me. Would that the briers _and_ thorns [the wicked internal foe] were lined up against Me in battle! I would stride in against them; I would burn them up together. 













###### 5 






Or else [if all Israel would escape being burned up together there is but one alternative], let them take hold of My strength _and_ make complete surrender to My protection, that they may make peace with Me! Yes, let them make peace with Me! 













###### 6 






In the days _and_ generations to come Jacob shall take root; Israel shall blossom and send forth shoots and fill the whole world with fruit [of the knowledge of the true God]. 













###### 7 






Has [the Lord] smitten [Israel] as He smote those who smote them? Or have [the Israelites] been slain as their slayers were slain? 













###### 8 






By driving them out of Canaan, by exile, You contended with them in a measure [O Lord]--He removed them with His rough blast as in the day of the east wind. 













###### 9 






Only on this condition shall the iniquity of Jacob (Israel) be forgiven _and_ purged, and this shall be the full fruit [God requires] for taking away his sin: that [Israel] should make all the stones of the [idol] altars like chalk stones crushed to pieces, so that the Asherim and the sun-images shall not remain standing _or_ rise again. 













###### 10 






For the fortified city is solitary, a habitation deserted and forsaken like the wilderness; there the calf grazes, and there he lies down; he strips its branches _and_ eats its twigs. 













###### 11 






When its boughs are withered _and_ dry, they are broken off; the women come _and_ set them afire. For they are a people of no understanding _or_ discernment--_witless folk_; therefore He Who made them will not have compassion on them, and He Who formed them will show them no favor. 













###### 12 






And it shall be in that day that the Lord will thresh out His grain from the flood of the River [Euphrates] to the Brook of Egypt, and you will be gathered one by one _and_ one to another, O children of Israel! 













###### 13 






And it shall be in that day that a great trumpet will be blown; and they will come who were lost _and_ ready to perish in the land of Assyria and those who were driven out to the land of Egypt, and they will worship the Lord on the holy mountain at Jerusalem.

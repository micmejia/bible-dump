# Isaiah 4

***














###### 1 






And in that day [^a]seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread and provide our own apparel; only let us be called by your name to take away our reproach [of being unmarried]. 













###### 2 






In that day the Branch of the Lord shall be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land shall be excellent and lovely to those of Israel who have escaped. 













###### 3 






And he who is left in Zion and remains in Jerusalem will be called holy, everyone who is recorded for life in Jerusalem _and for_ [^b]_eternal life_, 













###### 4 






After the Lord has washed away the [moral] filth of the daughters of Zion [pride, vanity, haughtiness] and has purged the bloodstains of Jerusalem from the midst of it by the spirit _and_ blast of judgment and by the spirit _and_ blast of burning _and_ sifting. 













###### 5 






And the Lord will create over the whole site, over every dwelling place of Mount Zion and over her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory shall be a canopy (a defense of divine love and protection). 













###### 6 






And there shall be a pavilion for shade in the daytime from the heat, and for a place of refuge and a shelter from storm and from rain. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

Over 57 percent of the enlisted men in World War I became casualties (according to _The World Almanac_), and the casualties in World War II have been estimated at 33 million. Not counting deaths in the armed forces, the ratio of deaths between males and females was (as of 1960) nine to seven. This had not been true in previous centuries. Isaiah here foresees a time when the ratio between marriageable men and women will be one to seven in Jerusalem. [^b]: Isaiah 4:3 _The Chaldee Translation_ reads “eternal life.”

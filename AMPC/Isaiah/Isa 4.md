# Isaiah 4

***














###### 1 






And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread and provide our own apparel; only let us be called by your name to take away our reproach [of being unmarried]. 













###### 2 






In that day the Branch of the Lord shall be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land shall be excellent and lovely to those of Israel who have escaped. 













###### 3 






And he who is left in Zion and remains in Jerusalem will be called holy, everyone who is recorded for life in Jerusalem _and for_ _eternal life_, 













###### 4 






After the Lord has washed away the [moral] filth of the daughters of Zion [pride, vanity, haughtiness] and has purged the bloodstains of Jerusalem from the midst of it by the spirit _and_ blast of judgment and by the spirit _and_ blast of burning _and_ sifting. 













###### 5 






And the Lord will create over the whole site, over every dwelling place of Mount Zion and over her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory shall be a canopy (a defense of divine love and protection). 













###### 6 






And there shall be a pavilion for shade in the daytime from the heat, and for a place of refuge and a shelter from storm and from rain.

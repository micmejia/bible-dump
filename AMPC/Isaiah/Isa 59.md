# Isaiah 59

***














###### 1 






Behold, the Lord's hand is not shortened at all, that it cannot save, nor His ear dull with deafness, that it cannot hear. 













###### 2 






But your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God, and your sins have hidden His face from you, so that He will not hear. 













###### 3 






For your hands are defiled with blood and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue mutters wickedness. 













###### 4 






None sues _or_ calls in righteousness [but for the sake of doing injury to others--to take some undue advantage]; no one goes to law honestly _and_ pleads [his case] in truth; they trust in emptiness, worthlessness _and_ futility, and speaking lies! They conceive mischief and bring forth evil! 













###### 5 






They hatch adders' eggs and weave the spider's web; he who eats of their eggs dies, and [from an egg] which is crushed a viper breaks out [for their nature is ruinous, deadly, evil]. 













###### 6 






Their webs will not serve as clothing, nor will they cover themselves with what they make; their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands. 













###### 7 






Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood. Their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; desolation and destruction are in their paths _and_ highways. 













###### 8 






The way of peace they know not, and there is no justice _or_ right in their goings. They have made them into crooked paths; whoever goes in them does not know peace. 













###### 9 






Therefore are justice _and_ right far from us, and righteousness _and_ salvation do not overtake us. We expectantly wait for light, but [only] see darkness; for brightness, but we walk in obscurity _and_ gloom. 













###### 10 






We grope for the wall like the blind, yes, we grope like those who have no eyes. We stumble at noonday as in the twilight; in dark places _and_ among those who are full of life _and_ vigor, we are as dead men. 













###### 11 






We all groan _and_ growl like bears and moan plaintively like doves. We look for justice, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far from us. 













###### 12 






For our transgressions are multiplied before You [O Lord], and our sins testify against us; for our transgressions are with us, and as for our iniquities, we know _and_ recognize them [as]: 













###### 13 






Rebelling against and denying the Lord, turning away from following our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving in and muttering _and_ moaning from the heart words of falsehood. 













###### 14 






Justice is turned away backward, and righteousness (uprightness and right standing with God) stands far off; for truth has fallen in the street (the city's forum), and uprightness cannot enter [the courts of justice]. 













###### 15 






Yes, truth is lacking, and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey. And the Lord saw it, and it displeased Him that there was no justice. 













###### 16 






And He saw that there was no man and wondered that there was no intercessor [no one to intervene on behalf of truth and right]; therefore His own arm brought Him victory, and His own righteousness [having the Spirit without measure] sustained Him. 













###### 17 






For [the Lord] put on righteousness as a breastplate _or_ coat of mail, and salvation as a helmet upon His head; He put on garments of vengeance for clothing and was clad with zeal [and furious divine jealousy] as a cloak. 













###### 18 






According as their deeds deserve, so will He repay wrath to His adversaries, recompense to His enemies; on the foreign islands _and_ coastlands He will make compensation. 













###### 19 






So [as the result of the Messiah's intervention] they shall [reverently] fear the name of the Lord from the west, and His glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against him _and_ put him to flight [for He will come like a rushing stream which the breath of the Lord drives]. 













###### 20 






He shall come as a Redeemer to Zion and to those in Jacob (Israel) who turn from transgression, says the Lord. 













###### 21 






As for Me, this is My covenant _or_ league with them, says the Lord: My Spirit, Who is upon you [and Who writes the law of God inwardly on the heart], and My words which I have put in your mouth shall not depart out of your mouth, or out of the mouths of your [true, spiritual] children, or out of the mouths of your children's children, says the Lord, from henceforth and forever.

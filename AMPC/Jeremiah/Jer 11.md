# Jeremiah 11

***














###### 1 






The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord: 













###### 2 






Hear the words of this covenant _or_ solemn pledge, and speak to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 













###### 3 






Say to them, Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Cursed is the man who does not heed the words of this covenant _or_ solemn pledge 













###### 4 






Which I commanded your fathers at the time that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, Listen to My voice and do according to all that I command you. So will you be My people, and I will be your God, 













###### 5 






That I may perform the oath which I swore to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day. Then I answered, Amen (so be it), O Lord. 













###### 6 






And the Lord said to me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem: Hear the words of this covenant _or_ solemn pledge and do them. 













###### 7 






For I earnestly protested to _and_ warned your fathers at the time that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even to this day, protesting to _and_ warning them persistently, saying, Obey My voice. 













###### 8 






Yet they did not obey or incline their ear [to Me], but everyone walked in the stubbornness of his own evil heart. Therefore I brought upon them all [the calamities threatened in] the words of this covenant _or_ solemn pledge, which I had commanded, but they did not do. 













###### 9 






And the Lord said to me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 













###### 10 






They have turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear My words; they have gone after other gods to serve them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken My covenant _or_ solemn pledge which I made with their fathers. 













###### 11 






Therefore thus says the Lord: Behold, I am bringing evil _and_ calamity upon them which they will not be able to escape; though they cry to Me, I will not listen to them. 













###### 12 






Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods to whom they offer incense, but they cannot save them at all in the time of their evil trouble. 













###### 13 






For [as many as] the number of your cities are your gods, O Judah; and [as many as] the number of the streets of Jerusalem are the altars you have set up to the shameful thing, even altars to burn incense to Baal. 













###### 14 






Therefore do not pray for this people or lift up a cry or prayer for them, for I will not listen when they cry out to Me in the time of their evil trouble. 













###### 15 






What right has My beloved [to be] in My house when she has wrought lewdness _and_ done treacherously many times? Can vows _and_ the holy flesh [of your sacrifices] remove from you your wickedness _and_ avert your calamity? Can you by these [escape your doom and] rejoice exultantly? 













###### 16 






The Lord [acknowledged you once to be worthy to be] called a green olive tree, fair _and_ of good fruit; but with the roar of a great tempest He will set fire to it, and its branches will be consumed. 













###### 17 






For the Lord of hosts, Who planted you, has pronounced evil _and_ calamity against you because of the evil which the house of Israel and the house of Judah have done against themselves in provoking Me to anger by offering incense to Baal. 













###### 18 






And the Lord gave me [Jeremiah] knowledge of it [their plot], and I knew it; then You [O Lord] showed me their doings. 













###### 19 






But I was like a tame lamb that is brought to the slaughter; I did not know that they had devised inventions _and_ schemes against me, saying, Let us destroy the tree with its fruit; let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered. 













###### 20 






But, O Lord of hosts, Who judges rightly _and_ justly, Who tests the heart and the mind, let me see Your vengeance on them, for to You I have revealed _and_ committed my cause [rolling it upon You]. 













###### 21 






Therefore thus says the Lord about the men of Anathoth [Jeremiah's hometown], who seek your life [Jeremiah] and say, Prophesy not in the name of the Lord, that you die not by our hands-- 













###### 22 






Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts: Behold, I will punish them. Their young men will die by the sword, their sons and their daughters will die by famine; 













###### 23 






And there will be no remnant [of the conspirators] left, for I will bring evil _and_ calamity upon the men of Anathoth in the year of their punishment. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

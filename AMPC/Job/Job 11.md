# Job 11

***














###### 1 






Then Zophar the Naamathite replied, 













###### 2 






Should not the multitude of words be answered? And should a man full of talk [and making such great professions] be pronounced free from guilt _or_ blame? 













###### 3 






Should your boastings _and_ babble make men keep silent? And when you mock _and_ scoff, shall no man make you ashamed? 













###### 4 






For you have said, My doctrine [that God afflicts the righteous knowingly] is pure, and I am clean in [God's] eyes. 













###### 5 






But oh, that God would speak, and open His lips against you, 













###### 6 






And that He would show you the secrets of wisdom! For He is manifold in understanding! Know therefore that God exacts of you less than your guilt _and_ iniquity [deserve]. 













###### 7 






Can you find out the deep things of God, or can you by searching find out the limits of the Almighty [explore His depths, ascend to His heights, extend to His breadths, and comprehend His infinite perfection]? 













###### 8 






His wisdom is as high as the heights of heaven! What can you do? It is deeper than Sheol (the place of the dead)! What can you know? 













###### 9 






Longer in measure [and scope] is it than the earth, and broader than the sea. 













###### 10 






If [God] sweeps in and arrests and calls into judgment, who can hinder Him? [If He is against a man, who shall call Him to account for it?] 













###### 11 






For He recognizes _and_ knows hollow, wicked, _and_ useless men (men of falsehood); when He sees iniquity, will He not consider it? 













###### 12 






But a stupid man will get wisdom [only] when a wild donkey's colt is born a man [as when he thinks himself free because he is lifted up in pride]. 













###### 13 






If you set your heart aright and stretch out your hands to [God], 













###### 14 






If you put sin out of your hand _and_ far away from you and let not evil dwell in your tents; 













###### 15 






Then can you lift up your face to Him without stain [of sin, and unashamed]; yes, you shall be steadfast _and_ secure; you shall not fear. 













###### 16 






For you shall forget your misery; you shall remember it as waters that pass away. 













###### 17 






And [your] life shall be clearer than the noonday _and_ rise above it; though there be darkness, it shall be as the morning. 













###### 18 






And you shall be secure _and_ feel confident because there is hope; yes, you shall search about you, and you shall take your rest in safety. 













###### 19 






You shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid; yes, many shall sue for your favor. 













###### 20 






But the eyes of the wicked shall look [for relief] in vain, and they shall not escape [the justice of God]; and their hope shall be to give up the ghost.

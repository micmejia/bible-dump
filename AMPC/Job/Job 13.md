# Job 13

***














###### 1 






[Job continued:] Behold, my eye has seen all this, my ear has heard and understood it. 













###### 2 






What you know, I also know; I am not inferior to you. 













###### 3 






Surely I wish to speak to the Almighty, and I desire to argue _and_ reason my case with God [that He may explain the conflict between what I believe of Him and what I see of Him]. 













###### 4 






But you are forgers of lies [you defame my character most untruthfully]; you are all physicians of no value _and_ have no remedy to offer. 













###### 5 






Oh, that you would altogether hold your peace! Then you would evidence your wisdom _and_ you might pass for wise men. 













###### 6 






Hear now my reasoning, and listen to the pleadings of my lips. 













###### 7 






Will you speak unrighteously for God and talk deceitfully for Him? 













###### 8 






Will you show partiality to Him [be unjust to me in order to gain favor with Him]? Will you act as special pleaders for God? 













###### 9 






Would it be profitable for you if He should investigate your tactics [with me]? Or as one deceives _and_ mocks a man, do you deceive _and_ mock Him? 













###### 10 






He will surely reprove you if you do secretly show partiality. 













###### 11 






Shall not His majesty make you afraid, and should not your awe for Him restrain you? 













###### 12 






Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes [valueless]; your defenses are defenses of clay [and will crumble]. 













###### 13 






Hold your peace! Let me alone, so I may speak; and let come on me what may. 













###### 14 






Why should I take my flesh in my teeth and put my life in my hands [incurring the danger of God's wrath]? 













###### 15 






[I do it because, though He slay me, yet will I wait for and trust Him and] behold, He will slay me; I have no hope--nevertheless, I will maintain _and_ argue my ways before Him _and_ even to His face. 













###### 16 






This will be my salvation, that a polluted _and_ godless man shall not come before Him. 













###### 17 






Listen diligently to my speech, and let my declaration be in your ears. 













###### 18 






Behold now, I have prepared my case; I know that I shall be justified _and_ vindicated. 













###### 19 






Who is he who will argue against _and_ refute me? For then I would hold my peace and expire. 













###### 20 






Only [O Lord] grant two conditions to me, and then will I not hide myself from You: 













###### 21 






Withdraw Your hand and take this bodily suffering far from me; and let not my [reverent] dread of You terrify me. 













###### 22 






Then [Lord] call and I will answer, or let me speak, and You answer me. 













###### 23 






How many are my iniquities and sins [that so much sorrow should come to me]? Make me recognize _and_ know my transgression and my sin. 













###### 24 






Why do You hide Your face [as if offended] and alienate me as if I were Your enemy? 













###### 25 






Will You harass _and_ frighten a [poor, helpless] leaf driven to and fro, and will You pursue the chaff of the dry stubble? 













###### 26 






For You write bitter things against me [in Your bill of indictment] and make me inherit _and_ be accountable now for the iniquities of my youth. 













###### 27 






You put my feet also in the stocks and observe critically all my paths; You set a circle _and_ limit around the soles of my feet [which I must not overstep]. 













###### 28 






And he wastes away as a rotten thing, like a garment that is moth-eaten.

# Job 17

***














###### 1 






My spirit is broken, my days are spent (snuffed out); the grave is ready for me. 













###### 2 






Surely there are mockers _and_ mockery around me, and my eye dwells on their obstinacy, insults, _and_ resistance. 













###### 3 






Give me a pledge with Yourself [acknowledge my innocence before my death]; who is there that will give security for me? 













###### 4 






But their hearts [Lord] You have closed to understanding; therefore You will not let them triumph [by giving them a verdict against me]. 













###### 5 






He who denounces his friends [in order to make them] a prey _and_ get a share, the eyes of his children shall fail [to find food]. 













###### 6 






But He has made me a byword among the people, and they spit before my face. 













###### 7 






My eye has grown dim because of grief, and all my members are [wasted away] like a shadow. 













###### 8 






Upright men shall be astonished _and_ appalled at this, and the innocent shall stir himself up against the godless _and_ polluted. 













###### 9 






Yet shall the righteous (those upright and in right standing with God) hold to their ways, and he who has clean hands shall grow stronger and stronger. 













###### 10 






But as for you, come on again, all of you, though I find not a wise man among you. 













###### 11 






My days are past, my purposes _and_ plans are frustrated; even the thoughts (desires and possessions) of my heart [are broken off]. 













###### 12 






These [thoughts] extend from the night into the day, [so that] the light is short because of darkness. 













###### 13 






But if I look to Sheol (the unseen state) as my abode, if I spread my couch in the darkness, 













###### 14 






If I say to the grave _and_ corruption, You are my father, and to the worm [that feeds on decay], You are my mother and my sister [because I will soon be closest to you], 













###### 15 






Where then is my hope? And if I have hope, who will see [its fulfillment]? 













###### 16 






[My hope] shall go down to the bars of Sheol (the unseen state) when once there is rest in the dust.

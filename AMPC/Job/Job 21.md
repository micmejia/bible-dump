# Job 21

***














###### 1 






Then Job answered, 













###### 2 






Hear diligently my speech, and let this [your attention] be your consolation [given me]. 













###### 3 






Allow me, and I also will speak; and after I have spoken, mock on. 













###### 4 






As for me, is my complaint to man _or_ of him? And why should I not be impatient _and_ my spirit be troubled? 













###### 5 






Look at me and be astonished (appalled); and lay your hand upon your mouth. 













###### 6 






Even when I remember, I am troubled _and_ afraid; horror _and_ trembling take hold of my flesh. 













###### 7 






Why do the wicked live, become old, and become mighty in power? 













###### 8 






Their children are established with them in their sight, and their offspring before their eyes. 













###### 9 






Their houses are safe _and_ in peace, without fear; neither is the rod of God upon them. 













###### 10 






Their bull breeds and fails not; their cows calve and do not miscarry. 













###### 11 






They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children skip about. 













###### 12 






They themselves lift up their voices _and_ sing to the tambourine and the lyre and rejoice to the sound of the pipe. 













###### 13 






They spend their days in prosperity and go down to Sheol (the unseen state) in a moment _and_ peacefully. 













###### 14 






Yet they say to God, Depart from us, for we do not desire the knowledge of Your ways. 













###### 15 






Who is the Almighty, that we should serve Him? And what profit do we have if we pray to Him? 













###### 16 






But notice, [you say] the prosperity of the wicked is not in their power; the mystery [of God's dealings] with the ungodly is far from my comprehension. 













###### 17 






How often [then] is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out? That their calamity comes upon them? That God distributes pains _and_ sorrows to them in His anger? 













###### 18 






That they are like stubble before the wind and like chaff that the storm steals _and_ carries away? 













###### 19 






You say, God lays up [the punishment of the wicked man's] iniquity for his children. Let Him recompense it to the man himself, that he may know _and_ feel it. 













###### 20 






Let his own eyes see his destruction, and let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty. 













###### 21 






For what pleasure _or_ interest has a man in his house _and_ family after he is dead, when the number of his months is cut off? 













###### 22 






Shall any teach God knowledge, seeing that He judges those who are on high? 













###### 23 






One dies in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet; 













###### 24 






His pails are full of milk [his veins are filled with nourishment], and the marrow of his bones is fresh _and_ moist, 













###### 25 






Whereas another man dies in bitterness of soul and never tastes of pleasure _or_ good fortune. 













###### 26 






They lie down alike in the dust, and the worm spreads a covering over them. 













###### 27 






Behold, I know your thoughts _and_ plans and the devices with which you would wrong me. 













###### 28 






For you say, Where is the house of the rich _and_ liberal prince [meaning me]? And where is the tent in which the wicked [Job] dwelt? 













###### 29 






Have you not asked those who travel this way, and do you not accept their testimony _and_ evidences-- 













###### 30 






That the evil man is [now] spared in the day of calamity _and_ destruction, and they are led forth _and_ away on the day of [God's] wrath? 













###### 31 






But who declares [a man's] way [and rebukes] him to his face? And who pays him back for what he has done? 













###### 32 






When he is borne to the grave, watch is kept over his tomb. 













###### 33 






The clods of the valley are sweet to him, and every man shall follow him to a grave, as innumerable people [have gone] before him. 













###### 34 






How then can you comfort me with empty _and_ futile words, since in your replies there lurks falsehood?

# Job 26

***














###### 1 






But Job answered, 













###### 2 






How you have helped him who is without power! How you have sustained the arm that is without strength! 













###### 3 






How you have counseled him who has no wisdom! And how plentifully you have declared to him sound knowledge! 













###### 4 






With whose assistance have you uttered these words? And whose spirit [inspired what] came forth from you? 













###### 5 






The shades of the dead tremble underneath the waters and their inhabitants. 













###### 6 






Sheol (the place of the dead) is naked before God, and Abaddon (the place of destruction) has no covering [from His eyes]. 













###### 7 






He it is Who spreads out the northern skies over emptiness and [^a]hangs the earth upon _or_ over nothing. 













###### 8 






He holds the waters bound in His clouds [which otherwise would spill on earth all at once], and the cloud is not rent under them. 













###### 9 






He covers the face of His throne and spreads over it His cloud. 













###### 10 






He has placed an enclosing limit [the horizon] upon the waters at the boundary between light and darkness. 













###### 11 






The pillars of the heavens tremble and are astonished at His rebuke. 













###### 12 






He stills _or_ stirs up the sea by His power, and by His understanding He smites proud Rahab. 













###### 13 






By His breath the heavens are garnished; His hand pierced the [swiftly] fleeing serpent. 













###### 14 






Yet these are but [a small part of His doings] the outskirts of His ways _or_ the mere fringes of His force, the faintest whisper of His voice! Who dares contemplate _or_ who can understand the thunders of His full, magnificent power? ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

The Bible made no such absurd error. How could Job, more than 3,000 years ago, possibly have known that God “hangs the earth upon _or_ over nothing,” except by divine inspiration?

# Job 29

***














###### 1 






And Job again took up his discussion and said, 













###### 2 






Oh, that I were as in the months of old, as in the days when God watched over me, 













###### 3 






When His lamp shone above _and_ upon my head and by His light I walked through darkness; 













###### 4 






As I was in the [prime] ripeness of my days, when the friendship _and_ counsel of God were over my tent, 













###### 5 






When the Almighty was yet with me and my children were about me, 













###### 6 






When my steps [through rich pasturage] were washed with butter and the rock poured out for me streams of oil! 













###### 7 






When I went out to the gate of the city, when I prepared my seat in the street [the broad place for the council at the city's gate], 













###### 8 






The young men saw me and hid themselves; the aged rose up _and_ stood; 













###### 9 






The princes refrained from talking and laid their hands on their mouths; 













###### 10 






The voices of the nobles were hushed, and their tongues cleaved to the roof of their mouths. 













###### 11 






For when the ear heard, it called me happy _and_ blessed me; and when the eye saw, it testified for me [approvingly], 













###### 12 






Because I delivered the poor who cried, the fatherless and him who had none to help him. 













###### 13 






The blessing of him who was about to perish came upon me, and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy. 













###### 14 






I put on [^a]righteousness, and it clothed me _or_ clothed itself with me; my justice was like a robe and a turban _or_ a diadem _or_ a crown! 













###### 15 






I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame. 













###### 16 






I was a father to the poor _and_ needy; the cause of him I did not know I searched out. 













###### 17 






And I broke the jaws _or_ the big teeth of the unrighteous and plucked the prey out of his teeth. 













###### 18 






Then I said, I shall die in _or_ beside my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand. 













###### 19 






My root is spread out _and_ open to the waters, and the dew lies all night upon my branch. 













###### 20 






My glory _and_ honor are fresh in me [being constantly renewed], and my bow gains [ever] new strength in my hand. 













###### 21 






Men listened to me and waited and kept silence for my counsel. 













###### 22 






After I spoke, they did not speak again, and my speech dropped upon them [like a refreshing shower]. 













###### 23 






And they waited for me as for the rain, and they opened their mouths wide as for the spring rain. 













###### 24 






I smiled on them when they had no confidence, and their depression did not cast down the light of my countenance. 













###### 25 






I chose their way [for them] and sat as [their] chief, and dwelt like a king among his soldiers, like one who comforts mourners.

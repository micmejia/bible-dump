# Job 3

***














###### 1 






After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed his day (birthday). 













###### 2 






And Job said, 













###### 3 






Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night which announced, There is a man-child conceived. 













###### 4 






Let that day be darkness! May not God above regard it, nor light shine upon it. 













###### 5 






Let gloom and deep darkness claim it for their own; let a cloud dwell upon it; let all that blackens the day terrify it (the day that I was born). 













###### 6 






As for that night, let thick darkness seize it; let it not rejoice among the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the months. 













###### 7 






Yes, let that night be solitary _and_ barren; let no joyful voice come into it. 













###### 8 






Let those curse it who curse the day, who are skilled in rousing up Leviathan. 













###### 9 






Let the stars of the early dawn of that day be dark; let [the morning] look in vain for the light, nor let it behold the day's dawning, 













###### 10 






Because it shut not the doors of my mother's womb nor hid sorrow _and_ trouble from my eyes. 













###### 11 






Why was I not stillborn? Why did I not give up the ghost when my mother bore me? 













###### 12 






Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breasts, that I should suck? 













###### 13 






For then would I have lain down and been quiet; I would have slept; then would I have been at rest [in death] 













###### 14 






With kings and counselors of the earth, who built up [now] desolate ruins for themselves, 













###### 15 






Or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver. 













###### 16 






Or [why] was I not a miscarriage, hidden _and_ put away, as infants who never saw light? 













###### 17 






There [in death] the wicked cease from troubling, and there the weary are at rest. 













###### 18 






There the [captive] prisoners rest together; they hear not the taskmaster's voice. 













###### 19 






The small and the great are there, and the servant is free from his master. 













###### 20 






Why is light [of life] given to him who is in misery, and life to the bitter in soul, 













###### 21 






Who long _and_ wait for death, but it comes not, and dig for it more than for hidden treasures, 













###### 22 






Who rejoice exceedingly and are elated when they find the grave? 













###### 23 






[Why is the light of day given] to a man whose way is hidden, and whom God has hedged in? 













###### 24 






For my sighing comes before my food, and my groanings are poured out like water. 













###### 25 






For the thing which I greatly fear comes upon me, and that of which I am afraid befalls me. 













###### 26 






I was not _or_ am not at ease, nor had I _or_ have I rest, nor was I _or_ am I quiet, yet trouble came _and_ still comes [upon me]. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

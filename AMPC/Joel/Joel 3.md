# Joel 3

***














###### 1 






For behold, in those days and at that time when I shall reverse the captivity _and_ restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem, 













###### 2 






I will gather all nations and will bring them down into the Valley of Jehoshaphat, and there will I deal with _and_ execute judgment upon them for [their treatment of] My people and of My heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations and [because] they have divided My land. 













###### 3 






And they have cast lots for My people, and have given a boy for a harlot and have sold a girl for juice [of the grape] and have drunk it. 













###### 4 






Yes, and what are you to Me, O Tyre and Sidon and all the [five small] divisions of Philistia? Will you pay Me back for something? Even if you pay Me back, swiftly and speedily I will return your deed [of retaliation] upon your own head, 













###### 5 






Because you have taken My silver and My gold and have carried into your temples _and_ palaces My precious treasures, 













###### 6 






And have sold the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem to the sons of the Grecians, that you may remove them far from their border. 













###### 7 






Behold, I will stir them up out of the place to which you have sold them and will return your deed [of retaliation] upon your own head. 













###### 8 






I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans, to a nation far off, for the Lord has spoken it. 













###### 9 






Proclaim this among the nations: Prepare war! Stir up the mighty men! Let all the men of war draw near, let them come up. 













###### 10 






Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning hooks into spears; let the weak say, I am strong [a warrior]! 













###### 11 






Hasten and come, all you nations round about, and assemble yourselves; there You, O Lord, will bring down Your mighty ones (Your warriors). 













###### 12 






Let the nations bestir themselves and come up to the Valley of Jehoshaphat, for there will I sit to judge all the nations round about. 













###### 13 






Put in the sickle, for the [vintage] harvest is ripe; come, get down _and_ tread the grapes, for the winepress is full; the vats overflow, for the wickedness [of the peoples] is great. 













###### 14 






Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision. 













###### 15 






The sun and the moon are darkened and the stars withdraw their shining. 













###### 16 






The Lord will thunder _and_ roar from Zion and utter His voice from Jerusalem, and the heavens and the earth shall shake; but the Lord will be a refuge for His people and a stronghold to the children of Israel. 













###### 17 






So shall you know, understand, _and_ realize that I am the Lord your God, dwelling in Zion, My holy mountain. Then shall Jerusalem be holy, and strangers _and_ foreigners [not born into the family of God] shall no more pass through it. 













###### 18 






And in that day, the mountains shall drip with fresh juice [of the grape] and the hills shall flow with milk; and all the brooks _and_ riverbeds of Judah shall flow with water, and a fountain shall come forth from the house of the Lord and shall water the Valley of Shittim. 













###### 19 






Egypt shall be a desolation and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness for their violence against the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land. 













###### 20 






But Judah shall remain _and_ be inhabited forever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation. 













###### 21 






And I will cleanse _and_ hold as innocent their blood _and_ avenge it, blood which I have not cleansed, held innocent, _and_ avenged, for the Lord dwells in Zion. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

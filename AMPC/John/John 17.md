# John 17

***














###### 1 






When Jesus had spoken these things, He lifted up His eyes to heaven and said, Father, the hour has come. Glorify _and_ exalt _and_ honor _and_ magnify Your Son, so that Your Son may glorify _and_ extol _and_ honor _and_ magnify You. 













###### 2 






[Just as] You have granted Him power _and_ authority over all flesh (all humankind), [now glorify Him] so that He may give eternal life to all whom You have given Him. 













###### 3 






And this is eternal life: [it means] to know (to perceive, recognize, become acquainted with, and understand) You, the only true _and_ real God, and [likewise] to know Him, Jesus [as the] Christ (the Anointed One, the Messiah), Whom You have sent. 













###### 4 






I have glorified You down here on the earth by completing the work that You gave Me to do. 













###### 5 






And now, Father, glorify Me along with Yourself _and_ restore Me to such majesty _and_ honor in Your presence as I had with You before the world existed. 













###### 6 






I have manifested Your Name [I have revealed Your very Self, Your real Self] to the people whom You have given Me out of the world. They were Yours, and You gave them to Me, and they have obeyed _and_ kept Your word. 













###### 7 






Now [at last] they know _and_ understand that all You have given Me belongs to You [is really and truly Yours]. 













###### 8 






For the [uttered] words that You gave Me I have given them; and they have received _and_ accepted [them] and have come to know positively _and_ in reality [to believe with absolute assurance] that I came forth from Your presence, and they have believed _and_ are convinced that You did send Me. 













###### 9 






I am praying for them. I am not praying (requesting) for the world, but for those You have given Me, for they belong to You. 













###### 10 






All [things that are] Mine are Yours, and all [things that are] Yours belong to Me; and I am glorified in (through) them. [They have done Me honor; in them My glory is achieved.] 













###### 11 






And [now] I am no more in the world, but these are [still] in the world, and I am coming to You. Holy Father, keep in Your Name [in the knowledge of Yourself] those whom You have given Me, that they may be one as We [are one]. 













###### 12 






While I was with them, I kept _and_ preserved them in Your Name [in the knowledge and worship of You]. Those You have given Me I guarded _and_ protected, and not one of them has perished _or_ is lost except the son of perdition [Judas Iscariot--the one who is now doomed to destruction, destined to be lost], that the Scripture might be fulfilled. 













###### 13 






And now I am coming to You; I say these things while I am still in the world, so that My joy may be made full _and_ complete _and_ perfect in them [that they may experience My delight fulfilled in them, that My enjoyment may be perfected in their own souls, that they may have My gladness within them, filling their hearts]. 













###### 14 






I have given _and_ delivered to them Your word (message) and the world has hated them, because they are not of the world [do not belong to the world], just as I am not of the world. 













###### 15 






I do not ask that You will take them out of the world, but that You will keep _and_ protect them from the evil one. 













###### 16 






They are not of the world (worldly, belonging to the world), [just] as I am not of the world. 













###### 17 






Sanctify them [purify, consecrate, separate them for Yourself, make them holy] by the Truth; Your Word is Truth. 













###### 18 






Just as You sent Me into the world, I also have sent them into the world. 













###### 19 






And so for their sake _and_ on their behalf I sanctify (dedicate, consecrate) Myself, that they also may be sanctified (dedicated, consecrated, made holy) in the Truth. 













###### 20 






Neither for these alone do I pray [it is not for their sake only that I make this request], but also for all those who will ever come to believe in (trust in, cling to, rely on) Me through their word _and_ teaching, 













###### 21 






That they all may be one, [just] as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be one in Us, so that the world may believe _and_ be convinced that You have sent Me. 













###### 22 






I have given to them the glory _and_ honor which You have given Me, that they may be one [even] as We are one: 













###### 23 






I in them and You in Me, in order that they may become one _and_ perfectly united, that the world may know _and_ [definitely] recognize that You sent Me and that You have loved them [even] as You have loved Me. 













###### 24 






Father, I desire that they also whom You have entrusted to Me [as Your gift to Me] may be with Me where I am, so that they may see My glory, which You have given Me [Your love gift to Me]; for You loved Me before the foundation of the world. 













###### 25 






O just _and_ righteous Father, although the world has not known You _and_ has failed to recognize You _and_ has never acknowledged You, I have known You [continually]; and these men understand _and_ know that You have sent Me. 













###### 26 






I have made Your Name known to them _and_ revealed Your character _and_ Your very Self, and I will continue to make [You] known, that the love which You have bestowed upon Me may be in them [felt in their hearts] and that I [Myself] may be in them.

# John 7

***














###### 1 






After this, Jesus went from place to place in Galilee, for He would not travel in Judea because the Jews were seeking to kill Him. 













###### 2 






Now the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles was drawing near. 













###### 3 






So His brothers said to Him, Leave here and go into Judea, so that Your disciples [there] may also see the works that You do. [This is no place for You.] 













###### 4 






For no one does anything in secret when he wishes to be conspicuous _and_ secure publicity. If You [must] do these things [if You must act like this], show Yourself openly _and_ make Yourself known to the world! 













###### 5 






For [even] His brothers did not believe in _or_ adhere to _or_ trust in _or_ rely on Him either. 













###### 6 






Whereupon Jesus said to them, My time (opportunity) has not come yet; but any time is suitable for you _and_ your opportunity is ready any time [is always here]. 













###### 7 






The world cannot [be expected to] hate you, but it does hate Me because I denounce it for its wicked works _and_ reveal that its doings are evil. 













###### 8 






Go to the Feast yourselves. I am not [yet] going up to the Festival, because My time is not ripe. [My term is not yet completed; it is not time for Me to go.] 













###### 9 






Having said these things to them, He stayed behind in Galilee. 













###### 10 






But afterward, when His brothers had gone up to the Feast, He went up also, not publicly [not with a caravan], but by Himself quietly _and_ as if He did not wish to be observed. 













###### 11 






Therefore the Jews kept looking for Him at the Feast and asking, Where can He be? [Where is that Fellow?] 













###### 12 






And there was among the mass of the people much whispered discussion _and_ hot disputing about Him. Some were saying, He is good! [He is a good Man!] Others said, No, He misleads _and_ deceives the people [gives them false ideas]! 













###### 13 






But no one dared speak out boldly about Him for fear of [the leaders of] the Jews. 













###### 14 






When the Feast was already half over, Jesus went up into the temple [court] and began to teach. 













###### 15 






The Jews were astonished. They said, How is it that this Man has learning [is so versed in the sacred Scriptures and in theology] when He has never studied? 













###### 16 






Jesus answered them by saying, My teaching is not My own, but His Who sent Me. 













###### 17 






If any man desires to do His will (God's pleasure), he will know (have the needed illumination to recognize, and can tell for himself) whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking from Myself _and_ of My own accord _and_ on My own authority. 













###### 18 






He who speaks on his own authority seeks to win honor for himself. [He whose teaching originates with himself seeks his own glory.] But He Who seeks the glory _and_ is eager for the honor of Him Who sent Him, He is true; and there is no unrighteousness _or_ falsehood _or_ deception in Him. 













###### 19 






Did not Moses give you the Law? And yet not one of you keeps the Law. [If that is the truth] why do you seek to kill Me [for not keeping it]? 













###### 20 






The crowd answered Him, You are possessed by a demon! [You are raving!] Who seeks to kill You? 













###### 21 






Jesus answered them, I did one work, and you all are astounded. 













###### 22 






Now Moses established circumcision among you--though it did not originate with Moses but with the previous patriarchs--and you circumcise a person [even] on the Sabbath day. 













###### 23 






If, to avoid breaking the Law of Moses, a person undergoes circumcision on the Sabbath day, have you any cause to be angry with (indignant with, bitter against) Me for making a man's whole body well on the Sabbath? 













###### 24 






Be honest in your judgment _and_ do not decide at a glance (superficially and by appearances); but judge fairly _and_ righteously. 













###### 25 






Then some of the Jerusalem people said, Is not this the Man they seek to kill? 













###### 26 






And here He is speaking openly, and they say nothing to Him! Can it be possible that the rulers have discovered _and_ know that this is truly the Christ? 













###### 27 






No, we know where this Man comes from; when the Christ arrives, no one is to know from what place He comes. 













###### 28 






Whereupon Jesus called out as He taught in the temple [porches], Do you know Me, and do you know where I am from? I have not come on My own authority _and_ of My own accord _and_ as self-appointed, but the One Who sent Me is true (real, genuine, steadfast); and Him you do not know! 













###### 29 






I know Him [Myself] because I come from His [very] presence, and it was He [personally] Who sent Me. 













###### 30 






Therefore they were eager to arrest Him, but no one laid a hand on Him, for His hour (time) had not yet come. 













###### 31 






And besides, many of the multitude believed in Him [adhered to Him, trusted in Him, relied on Him]. And they kept saying, When the Christ comes, will He do [can He be expected to do] more miracles _and_ produce more proofs _and_ signs than what this Man has done? 













###### 32 






The Pharisees learned how the people were saying these things about Him under their breath; and the chief priests and Pharisees sent attendants (guards) to arrest Him. 













###### 33 






Therefore Jesus said, For a little while I am [still] with you, and then I go back to Him Who sent Me. 













###### 34 






You will look for Me, but you will not [be able to] find Me; where I am, you cannot come. 













###### 35 






Then the Jews said among themselves, Where does this Man intend to go that we shall not find Him? Will He go to the Jews who are scattered in the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks? 













###### 36 






What does this statement of His mean, You will look for Me and not be able to find Me, and, Where I am, you cannot come? 













###### 37 






Now on the final and most important day of the Feast, Jesus stood, and He cried in a loud voice, If any man is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink! 













###### 38 






He who believes in Me [who cleaves to _and_ trusts in _and_ relies on Me] as the Scripture has said, From his innermost being shall flow [continuously] springs _and_ rivers of living water. 













###### 39 






But He was speaking here of the Spirit, Whom those who believed (trusted, had faith) in Him were afterward to receive. For the [Holy] Spirit had not yet been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified (raised to honor). 













###### 40 






Listening to those words, some of the multitude said, This is certainly _and_ beyond doubt the Prophet! 













###### 41 






Others said, This is the Christ (the Messiah, Anointed One)! But some said, What? Does the Christ come out of Galilee? 













###### 42 






Does not the Scripture tell us that the Christ will come from the offspring of David and from Bethlehem, the village where David lived? 













###### 43 






So there arose a division _and_ dissension among the people concerning Him. 













###### 44 






Some of them wanted to arrest Him, but no one [ventured and] laid hands on Him. 













###### 45 






Meanwhile the attendants (guards) had gone back to the chief priests and Pharisees, who asked them, Why have you not brought Him here with you? 













###### 46 






The attendants replied, Never has a man talked as this Man talks! [No mere man has ever spoken as He speaks!] 













###### 47 






The Pharisees said to them, Are you also deluded _and_ led astray? [Are you also swept off your feet?] 













###### 48 






Has any of the authorities or of the Pharisees believed in Him? 













###### 49 






As for this multitude (rabble) that does not know the Law, they are contemptible _and_ doomed _and_ accursed! 













###### 50 






Then Nicodemus, who came to Jesus before at night and was one of them, asked, 













###### 51 






Does our Law convict a man without giving him a hearing and finding out what he has done? 













###### 52 






They answered him, Are you too from Galilee? Search [the Scriptures yourself], and you will see that no prophet comes (will rise to prominence) from Galilee. 













###### 53 






And they went [back], each to his own house.

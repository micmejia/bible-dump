# Joshua 1

***














###### 1 






After the death of Moses the servant of the Lord, the Lord said to Joshua son of Nun, Moses' minister, 













###### 2 






Moses My servant is dead. So now arise [take his place], go over this Jordan, you and all this people, into the land which I am giving to them, the Israelites. 













###### 3 






Every place upon which the sole of your foot shall tread, that have I given to you, as I promised Moses. 













###### 4 






From the wilderness and this Lebanon to the great river Euphrates--all the land of the [^a]Hittites [Canaan]--and to the Great [Mediterranean] Sea on the west shall be your territory. 













###### 5 






No man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will not fail you or forsake you. 













###### 6 






Be strong (confident) and of good courage, for you shall cause this people to inherit the land which I swore to their fathers to give them. 













###### 7 






Only you be strong and very courageous, that you may do according to all the law which Moses My servant commanded you. Turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may prosper wherever you go. 













###### 8 






This Book of the Law shall not depart out of your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, that you may observe _and_ do according to all that is written in it. For then you shall make your way prosperous, and then you shall deal wisely _and_ have good [^b]success. 













###### 9 






Have not I commanded you? Be strong, vigorous, and very courageous. Be not afraid, neither be dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go. 













###### 10 






Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying, 













###### 11 






Pass through the camp and command the people, Prepare your provisions, for within three days you shall pass over this Jordan to go in to take possession of the land which the Lord your God is giving you to possess. 













###### 12 






And to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joshua said, 













###### 13 






Remember what Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you, saying, The Lord your God is giving you [of these two and a half tribes a place of] rest and will give you this land [east of the Jordan]. 













###### 14 






Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle shall dwell in the land which Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan, but all your mighty men of valor shall pass on before your brethren [of the other tribes] armed, and help them [possess their land] 













###### 15 






Until the Lord gives your brethren rest, as He has given you, and they also possess the land the Lord your God is giving them. Then you shall return to the land of your possession and possess it, the land Moses the Lord's servant gave you on the sunrise side of the Jordan. 













###### 16 






They answered Joshua, All you command us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go. 













###### 17 






As we hearkened to Moses in all things, so will we hearken to you; only may the Lord your God be with you as He was with Moses. 













###### 18 






Whoever rebels against your commandment and will not hearken to all you command him shall be put to death. Only be strong, vigorous, _and_ of good courage. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

But archaeological discoveries of the twentieth century have confirmed the importance of the Hittites beyond all question. For instance, G. A. Barton in _Archaeology and the Bible_ records the existence of an archive of clay tablets containing among other things a military treaty made by the Egyptians and the Hittites nearly thirteen centuries before the birth of Christ. [^b]: Joshua 1:8 This is the only place in the early English versions where the word “success” is found. The secret of success is given in verses 5 through 9. Joshua accepted Moses’ place of leadership without misgivings. God’s will for him was his will, and he did not hesitate. To go “all out” for God was already habitual with him; it is the unfailing prerequisite of eternal success (Deut. 6:3-5; Ps. 1:1-3; Luke 10:25-28).

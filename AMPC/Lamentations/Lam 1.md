# Lamentations 1

***














###### 1 






How solitary _and_ lonely sits the city [Jerusalem] that was [once] full of people! How like a widow has she become! She who was great among the nations and princess among the provinces has become a tributary [in servitude]! 













###### 2 






She weeps bitterly in the night, and her tears are [constantly] on her cheeks. Among all her lovers (allies) she has no one to comfort her. All her friends have dealt treacherously with her; they have become her enemies. 













###### 3 






Judah has gone into exile [to escape] from the affliction and laborious servitude [of the homeland]. She dwells among the [heathen] nations, but she finds no rest; all her persecutors overtook her amid the [dire] straits [of her distress]. 













###### 4 






The roads to Zion mourn, because no one comes to the solemn assembly _or_ the appointed feasts. All her gates are desolate, her priests sigh _and_ groan, her maidens are grieved _and_ vexed, and she herself is in bitterness. 













###### 5 






Her adversaries have become the head; her enemies prosper. For the Lord has afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions; her young children have gone into captivity before the enemy. 













###### 6 






From the Daughter of Zion all her beauty _and_ majesty have departed. Her princes have become like harts that find no pasture; they have fled without strength before the pursuer. 













###### 7 






Jerusalem [earnestly] remembers in the days of her affliction, in the days of her [compulsory] wanderings _and_ her bitterness, all the pleasant _and_ precious things that she had from the days of old. When her people fell into _and_ at the hands of the adversary, and there was none to help her, the enemy [gloated as they] looked at her, and they mocked at her desolations _and_ downfall. 













###### 8 






Jerusalem has grievously sinned; therefore she has become an unclean thing _and_ has been removed. All who honored her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness; yes, she herself groans _and_ sighs and turns [her face] away. 













###### 9 






Her filthiness was in _and_ on her skirts; she did not [seriously and earnestly] consider her final end. Therefore she has come down [from throne to slavery] singularly _and_ astonishingly; she has no comforter. O Lord [cries Jerusalem], look at my affliction, for the enemy has magnified himself [in triumph]! 













###### 10 






The adversary has spread out his hand upon all her precious _and_ desirable things; for she has seen the nations enter her sanctuary [of the temple]--when You commanded that they should not even enter Your congregation [in the outer courts]. 













###### 11 






All her people groan _and_ sigh, seeking for bread; they have given their desirable _and_ precious things [in exchange] for food to revive their strength _and_ bring back life. See, O Lord, and consider how wretched _and_ lightly esteemed, how vile _and_ abominable, I have become! 













###### 12 






Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by? Look and see if there is any sorrow like my sorrow which was dealt out to me, with which the Lord has afflicted me in the day of His fierce anger! 













###### 13 






From above He has sent fire into my bones, and it prevailed against them. He has spread a net for my feet; He has turned me back. He has made me hopelessly miserable and faint all the day long. 













###### 14 






The yoke of my transgressions is bound by His hand; they were twined together; they were set upon my neck. He has made my strength fail _and_ [me to] stumble; the Lord has delivered me into the hands of those I am unable to resist _or_ withstand. 













###### 15 






The Lord has made of no account all my [Jerusalem's] mighty men in the midst of me; He has proclaimed a set time against me to crush my young men. The Lord has trodden as in a winepress the Virgin Daughter of Judah. 













###### 16 






For these things I weep; my eyes overflow with tears, because a comforter, one who could refresh _and_ restore my soul, is far from me. My children are desolate _and_ perishing, for the enemy has prevailed. 













###### 17 






Zion stretches forth her hands, but there is no comforter for her. The Lord has commanded concerning _and_ against Jacob that his neighbors should be his adversaries; Jerusalem has become a filthy thing among them [an object of contempt]. 













###### 18 






The Lord is righteous (just and in the right); for I have rebelled against His commandment (His word). Hear, I pray you, all you peoples, and look at my sorrow _and_ suffering; my maidens and my young men have gone into captivity. 













###### 19 






I [Jerusalem] called to my lovers [allies], but they deceived me. My priests and my elders expired in the city while they sought food to save their lives. 













###### 20 






Behold, O Lord, how distressed I am! My vital parts (emotions) are in tumult _and_ are deeply disturbed; my heart cannot rest _and_ is violently agitated within me, for I have grievously rebelled. Outside the house the sword bereaves, at home there is [famine, pestilence] death! 













###### 21 






[My foes] have heard that I [Jerusalem] sigh _and_ groan, that I have no comforter [in You]. All my enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad [O Lord] that You have done it. You will bring the day [of Judah's punishment] that you have foretold _and_ proclaimed; [it involves also my foes' punishment] and they will become like me. 













###### 22 






Let all their wickedness come before You; and deal with them as You have dealt with me because of all my transgressions; for my sighs _and_ groans are many and my heart is faint.

# Lamentations 4

***














###### 1 






How the gold has become dim! How the most pure gold has changed! The hallowed stones [of the temple] are poured out at the head of every street. 













###### 2 






The noble _and_ precious sons of Zion, [once] worth their weight in fine gold--how they are esteemed [merely] as earthen pots _or_ pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter! 













###### 3 






Even the jackals draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones, but the daughter of my people has become cruel like ostriches in the wilderness [that desert their young]. 













###### 4 






The tongue of the nursing babe cleaves to the roof of its mouth because of thirst; the young children beg for food, but no one gives it to them. 













###### 5 






Those who feasted on dainties are perishing in the streets; those who were brought up in purple lie cleaving to refuse _and_ ash heaps. 













###### 6 






For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, which was overthrown in a moment, and no hands had come against her _or_ been laid on her. 













###### 7 






[In physical appearance] her princes were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk; they were more ruddy in body than rubies _or_ corals, their shapely figures [suggested a carefully cut] sapphire. 













###### 8 






[Prolonged famine has made] them look blacker than soot and darkness; they are not recognized in the streets. Their skin clings to their bones; it is withered and it has become [dry] like a stick. 













###### 9 






Those who are slain with the sword are more fortunate than those who are the victims of hunger [slain by the famine]; for they [the hungry] pine _and_ ebb away, stricken through for want of the fruits of the field. 













###### 10 






The hands of [heretofore] compassionate women have boiled their own children; they were their food during the destruction of the daughter of my people [Judah]. 













###### 11 






The Lord has fulfilled His wrath; He has poured out His fierce anger and has kindled a fire in Zion that has consumed her foundations. 













###### 12 






The kings of the earth did not believe, nor did any of the inhabitants of the earth, that the oppressor and enemy could enter the gates of Jerusalem. 













###### 13 






[But this happened] because of the sins of her [false] prophets and the iniquities of her priests, who shed the blood of the just _and_ righteous in the midst of her. 













###### 14 






[The false prophets and priests] wandered [staggering] in the streets as if blind; they had so polluted themselves with blood it was not [lawful] for men to touch their garments. 













###### 15 






[People] cried to them, Go away! Unclean! Depart! Depart! Touch not! When they fled away, then they wandered [as fugitives]; men said among the nations, They shall not stay here any longer. 













###### 16 






The anger of the Lord has scattered [and divided them among the nations]; He will no longer look after them. They did not respect the persons of the priests; they did not favor the elders. 













###### 17 






As for us, our eyes yet failed _and_ wasted away in looking for our worthless help. In our watching [on our watchtower] we have watched _and_ waited expectantly for a nation [Egypt or some other one to come to our rescue] that could not save us. 













###### 18 






[The missiles of the enemy] dog our steps, so that we cannot go into our streets; our end is near, our days are fulfilled--yes, our end has come. 













###### 19 






Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the sky; they pursued us on the mountains, they lay in wait for us in the wilderness. 













###### 20 






The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the Lord [our king], was taken in their snares--he of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the nations. 













###### 21 






Rejoice and be glad, O Daughter of Edom, you who dwell in the land of Uz. But the cup [of the wine of God's wrath] also shall pass to you; you shall become drunk and make yourself naked. 













###### 22 






The punishment of your iniquity will be accomplished _and_ completed, O Daughter of Zion; [the Lord] will no more carry you away _or_ keep you in exile. But He will inspect _and_ punish your iniquity _and_ guilt, O Daughter of Edom; He will uncover your sins.

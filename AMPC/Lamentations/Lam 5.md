# Lamentations 5

***














###### 1 






O Lord, [earnestly] remember what has come upon us! Look down and see our reproach (our national disgrace)! 













###### 2 






Our inheritance has fallen over to strangers, our houses to foreigners. 













###### 3 






We have become orphans and fatherless; our mothers are like widows. 













###### 4 






We have had to pay money to drink the water that belongs to us; our [own] wood is sold to us. 













###### 5 






Our pursuers are upon our necks [like a yoke]; we are weary and are allowed no rest. 













###### 6 






We have given the hand [as a pledge of fidelity and submission] to the Egyptians and to the Assyrians [merely] to get food to satisfy [our hunger]. 













###### 7 






Our fathers sinned and are no more, and [^a]we have borne their iniquities. 













###### 8 






Servants _and_ slaves rule over us; there is none to deliver us out of their hands. 













###### 9 






We get our bread at the peril of our lives because of the sword of the wilderness [the wild Arabs, who may attack if we venture into the fields to reap our harvests]. 













###### 10 






Our skin glows _and_ is parched as from [the heat of] an oven because of the burning heat of [the fever of] famine. 













###### 11 






They ravished the women in Zion, the virgins in the cities of Judah. 













###### 12 






They hung princes by their hands; the persons of elders were not respected. 













###### 13 






Young men carried millstones, and boys fell [staggering] under [burdens of] wood. 













###### 14 






The elders have ceased from [congregating at] the city's gate, the young men from their music. 













###### 15 






Ceased is the joy of our hearts; our dancing has turned into mourning. 













###### 16 






The crown has fallen from our head [our honor is brought to the dust]! Woe to us, for we have sinned! 













###### 17 






Because of this our hearts are faint _and_ sick; because of these things our eyes are dim _and_ see darkly. 













###### 18 






As for Mount Zion, which lies desolate, the jackals prowl over it! 













###### 19 






But You, O Lord, remain _and_ reign forever; Your throne endures from generation to [all] generations. 













###### 20 






Why do You forget us forever? Why do You forsake us so long? 













###### 21 






Turn us to Yourself, O Lord, and we shall be turned _and_ restored! Renew our days as of old!-- 













###### 22 






Or have You utterly rejected us? [^b]Or are You exceedingly angry with us [still]?

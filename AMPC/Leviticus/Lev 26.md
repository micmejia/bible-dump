# Leviticus 26

***














###### 1 






You shall make for yourselves no idols nor shall you erect a graven image, pillar, _or_ obelisk, nor shall you place any figured stone in your land to which _or_ on which to bow down; for I am the Lord your God. 













###### 2 






You shall keep My Sabbaths and reverence My sanctuary. I am the Lord. 













###### 3 






If you walk in My statutes and keep My commandments and do them, 













###### 4 






I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her increase and the trees of the field yield their fruit. 













###### 5 






And your threshing [time] shall reach to the vintage and the vintage [time] shall reach to the sowing time, and you shall eat your bread to the full and dwell in your land securely. 













###### 6 






I will give peace in the land; you shall lie down and none shall fill you with dread _or_ make you afraid; and I will clear ferocious (wild) beasts out of the land, and no sword shall go through your land. 













###### 7 






And you shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword. 













###### 8 






Five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight; your enemies shall fall before you by the sword. 













###### 9 






For I will be leaning toward you with favor _and_ regard for you, rendering you fruitful, multiplying you, and establishing _and_ ratifying My covenant with you. 













###### 10 






And you shall eat the [abundant] old store of produce long kept, and clear out the old [to make room] for the new. 













###### 11 






I will set My dwelling in _and_ among you, and My soul shall not despise _or_ reject _or_ separate itself from you. 













###### 12 






And I will walk in _and_ with _and_ among you and will be your God, and you shall be My people. 













###### 13 






I am the Lord your God, Who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that you should no more be slaves; and I have broken the bars of your yoke and made you walk erect [as free men]. 













###### 14 






But if you will not hearken to Me and will not do all these commandments, 













###### 15 






And if you spurn _and_ despise My statutes, and if your soul despises _and_ rejects My ordinances, so that you will not do all My commandments, but break My covenant, 













###### 16 






I will do this: I will appoint over you [sudden] terror (trembling, trouble), even consumption and fever that consume _and_ waste the eyes and make the [physical] life pine away. You shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it. 













###### 17 






I [the Lord] will set My face against you and [^a]you shall be defeated _and_ slain before your enemies; they who hate you shall rule over you; you shall flee when no one pursues you. 













###### 18 






And if in spite of all this you still will not listen _and_ be obedient to Me, then I will chastise _and_ discipline you seven times more for your sins. 













###### 19 






And I will break _and_ humble your pride in your power, and I will make your heavens as iron [yielding no answer, no blessing, no rain] and your earth [as sterile] as brass. 













###### 20 






And your strength shall be spent in vain, for your land shall not yield its increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruit. 













###### 21 






If you walk contrary to Me and will not heed Me, I will bring seven times more plagues upon you, according to your sins. 













###### 22 






I will loose the wild beasts of the field among you, which shall rob you of your children, destroy your livestock, and make you few so that your roads shall be deserted _and_ desolate. 













###### 23 






If by these means you are not turned to Me but determine to walk contrary to Me, 













###### 24 






I also will walk contrary to you, and I will smite you seven times for your sins. 













###### 25 






And I will bring a sword upon you that shall execute the vengeance [for the breaking] of My covenant; and you shall be gathered together within your cities, and I will send the pestilence among you, and you shall be delivered into the hands of the enemy. 













###### 26 






When I break your staff of bread _and_ cut off your supply of food, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall ration your bread _and_ deliver it again by weight; and you shall eat, and not be satisfied. 













###### 27 






And if in spite of all this you will not listen _and_ give heed to Me but walk contrary to Me, 













###### 28 






Then I will walk contrary to you in wrath, and I also will chastise you seven times for your sins. 













###### 29 






You shall eat the flesh of your sons _and_ of your daughters. 













###### 30 






And I will destroy your high places [devoted to idolatrous worship], and cut down your sun-images, and throw your dead bodies upon the [wrecked] bodies of your idols, and My soul shall abhor you [with deep and unutterable loathing]. 













###### 31 






I will lay your cities waste, bring your sanctuaries to desolation, and I will not smell the fragrance of your sweet _and_ soothing odors [of offerings made by fire]. 













###### 32 






And I will bring the land into desolation, and your enemies who dwell in it shall be astonished at it. 













###### 33 






I will scatter you among the nations and draw out [your enemies'] sword after you; and your land shall be desolate and your cities a waste. 













###### 34 






Then shall the land [of Israel have the opportunity to] enjoy its sabbaths as long as it lies desolate and you are in your enemies' land; then shall the land rest, to enjoy _and_ receive payments for its sabbaths [divinely ordained for it]. 













###### 35 






As long as it lies desolate _and_ waste, it shall have rest, the rest it did not have in your sabbaths when you dwelt upon it. 













###### 36 






As for those who are left of you, I will send dejection (lack of courage, a faintness) into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; the sound of a driven leaf shall put them to hasty _and_ tumultuous flight, and they shall flee as if from the sword, and fall when no one pursues them. 













###### 37 






They shall stumble over one another as if to escape a sword when no one pursues them; and you shall have no power to stand before your enemies. 













###### 38 






You shall perish among the nations; the land of your enemies shall eat you up. 













###### 39 






And those of you who are left shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away like them. 













###### 40 






But if they confess their own and their fathers' iniquity in their treachery which they committed against Me--and also that because they walked contrary to Me 













###### 41 






I also walked contrary to them and brought them into the land of their enemies--if then their uncircumcised hearts are humbled and they then accept the punishment for their iniquity, 













###### 42 






Then will I [earnestly] remember My covenant with Jacob, My covenant with Isaac, and My covenant with Abraham, and [earnestly] remember the land. 













###### 43 






But the land shall be left behind them and shall enjoy its sabbaths while it lies desolate without them; and they shall accept the punishment for their sins _and_ make amends because they despised _and_ rejected My ordinances and their soul scorned _and_ rejected My statutes. 













###### 44 






And [^b]yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not spurn _and_ cast them away, neither will I despise _and_ abhor them to destroy them utterly and to break My covenant with them, for I am the Lord their God. 













###### 45 






But I will for their sake [earnestly] remember the covenant with their forefathers whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God. I am the Lord. 













###### 46 






These are the statutes, ordinances, and laws which the Lord made between Him and the Israelites on Mount Sinai through Moses. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

Each of these prophecies was literally fulfilled in the following centuries. The Scripture references indicate where these fulfillments are recorded; there are at least a dozen of them. Yet some people do not seem to have awakened to the fact that God keeps His word, whether for us or against us. It all depends on us. [^b]: Leviticus 26:44 No greater evidence that God keeps His word is available than the fact of the existence today of the Jews as a nation. Scattered for twenty-five centuries throughout the world with powerful forces determined to wipe them out, yet they are restored to their homeland because, in spite of all their sins against Him, God refuses to break His covenant with their forefathers and with them. The presence of even a small number of Jews in the world, after all the centuries of diabolical effort to exterminate them, would alone be sufficient assurance that God will keep His promises, whether good or bad, to individuals or to nations.

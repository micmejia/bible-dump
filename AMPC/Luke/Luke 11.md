# Luke 11

***














###### 1 






Then He was praying in a certain place; and when He stopped, one of His disciples said to Him, Lord, teach us to pray, [just] as John taught his disciples. 













###### 2 






And He said to them, When you pray, say: _Our_ Father _Who is in heaven_, hallowed be Your name, Your kingdom come. _Your will be done [held holy and revered] on earth as it is in heaven._ 













###### 3 






Give us daily our bread [food for the morrow]. 













###### 4 






And forgive us our sins, for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us [who has offended us or done us wrong]. And bring us not into temptation _but rescue us from evil_. 













###### 5 






And He said to them, Which of you who has a friend will go to him at midnight and will say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves [of bread], 













###### 6 






For a friend of mine who is on a journey has just come, and I have nothing to put before him; 













###### 7 






And he from within will answer, Do not disturb me; the door is now closed, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot get up and supply you [with anything]? 













###### 8 






I tell you, although he will not get up and supply him anything because he is his friend, yet because of his shameless persistence _and_ insistence he will get up and give him as much as he needs. 













###### 9 






So I say to you, Ask _and_ keep on asking and it shall be given you; seek _and_ keep on seeking and you shall find; knock _and_ keep on knocking and the door shall be opened to you. 













###### 10 






For everyone who asks _and_ keeps on asking receives; and he who seeks _and_ keeps on seeking finds; and to him who knocks _and_ keeps on knocking, the door shall be opened. 













###### 11 






What father among you, if his son asks for _a loaf of bread, will give him a stone; or if he asks for_ a fish, will instead of a fish give him a serpent? 













###### 12 






Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? 













###### 13 






If you then, evil as you are, know how to give good gifts [gifts that are to their advantage] to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask _and_ continue to ask Him! 













###### 14 






Now Jesus was driving out a demon that was dumb; and it occurred that when the demon had gone out, the dumb man spoke. And the crowds marveled. 













###### 15 






But some of them said, He drives out demons [because He is in league with and] by Beelzebub, the prince of demons, 













###### 16 






While others, to try _and_ test _and_ tempt Him, demanded a sign of Him from heaven. 













###### 17 






But He, [well] aware of their intent _and_ purpose, said to them, Every kingdom split up against itself is doomed _and_ brought to desolation, and so house falls upon house. [The disunited household will collapse.] 













###### 18 






And if Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom last? For you say that I expel demons with the help of _and_ by Beelzebub. 













###### 19 






Now if I expel demons with the help of _and_ by Beelzebub, with whose help _and_ by whom do your sons drive them out? Therefore they shall be your judges. 













###### 20 






But if I drive out the demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has [already] come upon you. 













###### 21 






When the strong man, fully armed, [from his courtyard] guards his own dwelling, his belongings are undisturbed [his property is at peace and is secure]. 













###### 22 






But when one stronger than he attacks him and conquers him, he robs him of his whole armor on which he had relied and divides up _and_ distributes all his goods as plunder (spoil). 













###### 23 






He who is not with Me [siding and believing with Me] is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me [engage in My interest], scatters. 













###### 24 






When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person, it roams through waterless places in search [of a place] of rest (release, refreshment, ease); and finding none it says, I will go back to my house from which I came. 













###### 25 






And when it arrives, it finds [the place] swept _and_ put in order and furnished _and_ decorated. 













###### 26 






And it goes and brings other spirits, seven [of them], more evil than itself, and they enter in, settle down, _and_ dwell there; and the last state of that person is worse than the first. 













###### 27 






Now it occurred that as He was saying these things, a certain woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to Him, Blessed (happy and to be envied) is the womb that bore You and the breasts that You sucked! 













###### 28 






But He said, Blessed (happy and to be envied) rather are those who hear the Word of God and obey _and_ practice it! 













###### 29 






Now as the crowds were [increasingly] thronging Him, He began to say, This present generation is a wicked one; it seeks _and_ demands a sign (miracle), but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of Jonah [the prophet]. 













###### 30 






For [just] as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh, so will also the Son of Man be [a sign] to this age _and_ generation. 













###### 31 






The queen of the South will arise in the judgment with the people of this age _and_ generation and condemn them; for she came from the ends of the [inhabited] earth to listen to the wisdom of Solomon, and notice, here is more than Solomon. 













###### 32 






The men of Nineveh will appear as witnesses at the judgment with this generation and will condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, here is more than Jonah. 













###### 33 






No one after lighting a lamp puts it in a cellar _or_ crypt or under a bushel measure, but on a lampstand, that those who are coming in may see the light. 













###### 34 






Your eye is the lamp of your body; when your eye (your conscience) is sound _and_ fulfilling its office, your whole body is full of light; but when it is not sound _and_ is not fulfilling its office, your body is full of darkness. 













###### 35 






Be careful, therefore, that the light that is in you is not darkness. 













###### 36 






If then your entire body is illuminated, having no part dark, it will be wholly bright [with light], as when a lamp with its bright rays gives you light. 













###### 37 






Now while Jesus was speaking, a Pharisee invited Him to take dinner with him, so He entered and reclined at table. 













###### 38 






The Pharisee noticed and was astonished [to see] that Jesus did not first wash before dinner. 













###### 39 






But the Lord said to him, Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the plate, but inside you yourselves are full of greed _and_ robbery _and_ extortion and malice _and_ wickedness. 













###### 40 






You senseless (foolish, stupid) ones [acting without reflection or intelligence]! Did not He Who made the outside make the inside also? 













###### 41 






But [dedicate your inner self and] give as donations to the poor of those things which are within [of inward righteousness] and behold, everything is purified _and_ clean for you. 













###### 42 






But woe to you, Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and every [little] herb, but disregard _and_ neglect justice and the love of God. These you ought to have done without leaving the others undone. 













###### 43 






Woe to you, Pharisees! For you love the best seats in the synagogues and [you love] to be greeted _and_ bowed down to in the [public] marketplaces. 













###### 44 






Woe to you! For you are like graves which are not marked _or_ seen, and men walk over them without being aware of it [and are ceremonially defiled]. 













###### 45 






One of the experts in the [Mosaic] Law answered Him, Teacher, in saying this, You reproach _and_ outrage _and_ affront even us! 













###### 46 






But He said, Woe to you, the lawyers, also! For you load men with oppressive burdens hard to bear, and you do not personally [even gently] touch the burdens with one of your fingers. 













###### 47 






Woe to you! For you are rebuilding _and_ repairing the tombs of the prophets, whom your fathers killed (destroyed). 













###### 48 






So you bear witness and give your full approval _and_ consent to the deeds of your fathers; for they actually killed them, and you rebuild _and_ repair monuments to them. 













###### 49 






For this reason also the wisdom of God said, I will send them prophets and apostles, [some] of whom they will put to death and persecute, 













###### 50 






So that the blood of all the prophets shed from the foundation of the world may be charged against _and_ required of this age _and_ generation, 













###### 51 






From the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was slain between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, it shall be charged against _and_ required of this age _and_ generation. 













###### 52 






Woe to you, lawyers (experts in the Mosaic Law)! For you have taken away the key to knowledge; you did not go in yourselves, and you hindered _and_ prevented those who were entering. 













###### 53 






As He left there, the scribes and the Pharisees [followed Him closely, and they] began to be enraged with _and_ set themselves violently against Him and to draw Him out _and_ provoke Him to speak of many things, 













###### 54 






Secretly watching _and_ plotting _and_ lying in wait for Him, to seize upon something He might say [that they might accuse Him].

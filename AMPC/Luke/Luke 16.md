# Luke 16

***














###### 1 






Also [Jesus] said to the disciples, There was a certain rich man who had a [^a]manager of his estate, and accusations [against this man] were brought to him, that he was squandering his [master's] possessions. 













###### 2 






And he called him and said to him, What is this that I hear about you? Turn in the account of your management [of my affairs], for you can be [my] manager no longer. 













###### 3 






And the manager of the estate said to himself, What shall I do, seeing that my master is taking the management away from me? I am not able to dig, and I am ashamed to beg. 













###### 4 






I have come to know what I will do, so that they [my master's debtors] may accept _and_ welcome me into their houses when I am put out of the management. 













###### 5 






So he summoned his master's debtors one by one, and he said to the first, How much do you owe my master? 













###### 6 






He said, A hundred measures [about 900 gallons] of oil. And he said to him, Take back your written acknowledgement of [^b]obligation, and sit down quickly and write fifty [about 450 gallons]. 













###### 7 






After that he said to another, And how much do you owe? He said, A hundred measures [about 900 bushels] of wheat. He said to him, Take back your written acknowledgement of [^c]obligation, and write eighty [about 700 bushels]. 













###### 8 






And [his] master praised the dishonest (unjust) manager for acting [^d]shrewdly _and_ [^e]prudently; for the sons of this age are shrewder _and_ more prudent _and_ wiser in [[^f]relation to] their own generation [to their own age and [^g]kind] than are the sons of light. 













###### 9 






And I tell you, make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous mammon ([^h]deceitful riches, money, possessions), so that when it fails, they [those you have favored] may receive _and_ welcome you into the everlasting habitations (dwellings). 













###### 10 






He who is faithful in a very little [thing] is faithful also in much, and he who is dishonest _and_ unjust in a very little [thing] is dishonest _and_ unjust also in much. 













###### 11 






Therefore if you have not been faithful in the [case of] unrighteous mammon ([^i]deceitful riches, money, possessions), who will entrust to you the true riches? 













###### 12 






And if you have not proved faithful in that which belongs to another [whether God or man], who will give you that which is your own [that is, [^j]the true riches]? 













###### 13 






No servant is able to serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will stand by _and_ be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon (riches, or [^k]anything in which you trust and on which you rely). 













###### 14 






Now the Pharisees, who were covetous _and_ lovers of money, heard all these things [taken together], and they began to sneer at _and_ ridicule _and_ scoff at Him. 













###### 15 






But He said to them, You are the ones who declare yourselves just _and_ upright before men, but God knows your hearts. For what is exalted _and_ highly thought of among men is detestable _and_ abhorrent (an abomination) in the sight of God. 













###### 16 






Until John came, there were the Law and the Prophets; since then the good news (the Gospel) of the kingdom of God is being preached, and everyone strives violently to go in [would force his [^l]own way rather than God's way into it]. 













###### 17 






Yet it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one dot of the Law to fail _and_ become void. 













###### 18 






Whoever divorces (dismisses and repudiates) his wife and marries another commits adultery, and he who marries a woman who is divorced from her husband commits adultery. 













###### 19 






There was a certain rich man who [habitually] clothed himself in purple and fine linen and [^m]reveled _and_ feasted _and_ made merry in splendor every day. 













###### 20 






And at his gate there [^n]was [carelessly] dropped down _and_ left a certain [^o]utterly destitute man named Lazarus, [reduced to begging alms and] covered with [[^p]ulcerated] sores. 













###### 21 






He [eagerly] desired to be satisfied with what fell from the rich man's table; moreover, the dogs even came and licked his sores. 













###### 22 






And it occurred that the man [reduced to] begging died and was carried by the angels to Abraham's bosom. The rich man also died and was buried. 













###### 23 






And in Hades (the realm of the dead), being in torment, he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham far away, and Lazarus in his bosom. 













###### 24 






And he cried out and said, Father Abraham, have pity _and_ mercy on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am in anguish in this flame. 













###### 25 






But Abraham said, Child, remember that you in your lifetime fully received [what is due you in] comforts _and_ delights, and Lazarus in like manner the discomforts _and_ distresses; but now he is comforted here and you are in anguish. 













###### 26 






And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, in order that those who want to pass from this [place] to you may not be able, and no one may pass from there to us. 













###### 27 






And [the man] said, Then, father, I beseech you to send him to my father's house-- 













###### 28 






For I have five brothers--so that he may give [solemn] testimony _and_ warn them, lest they too come into this place of torment. 













###### 29 






But Abraham said, They have Moses and the Prophets; let them hear _and_ listen to them. 













###### 30 






But he answered, No, father Abraham, but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent ([^q]change their minds for the better and heartily amend their ways, with abhorrence of their past sins). 













###### 31 






He said to him, If they do not hear _and_ listen to Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be persuaded _and_ convinced _and_ believe [even] if someone should rise from the dead.

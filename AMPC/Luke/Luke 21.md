# Luke 21

***














###### 1 






Looking up, [Jesus] saw the rich people putting their gifts into the treasury. 













###### 2 






And He saw also a poor widow putting in two mites (copper coins). 













###### 3 






And He said, Truly I say to you, this poor widow has put in more than all of them; 













###### 4 






For they all gave out of their abundance (their surplus); but she has contributed out of her lack _and_ her want, putting in all that she had on which to live. 













###### 5 






And as some were saying of the temple that it was decorated with handsome (shapely and magnificent) stones and consecrated offerings [[^a]laid up to be kept], He said, 













###### 6 






As for all this that you [thoughtfully] look at, the time will come when there shall not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down. 













###### 7 






And they asked Him, Teacher, when will this happen? And what sign will there be when this is about to occur? 













###### 8 






And He said, Be on your guard _and_ be careful that you are not led astray; for many will come in My name [[^b]appropriating to themselves the name Messiah which belongs to Me], saying, I am He! and, The time is at hand! Do not go out after them. 













###### 9 






And when you hear of wars and insurrections (disturbances, disorder, and confusion), do not become alarmed _and_ panic-stricken _and_ terrified; for all this must take place first, but the end will not [come] immediately. 













###### 10 






Then He told them, Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. 













###### 11 






There will be mighty _and_ violent earthquakes, and in various places famines and pestilences (plagues: [^c]malignant and contagious or infectious epidemic diseases which are deadly and devastating); and there will be sights of terror and great signs from heaven. 













###### 12 






But previous to all this, they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, turning you over to the synagogues and prisons, and you will be led away before kings and governors for My name's sake. 













###### 13 






This will be a time (an opportunity) for you to bear testimony. 













###### 14 






Resolve _and_ settle it in your minds not to meditate _and_ prepare beforehand how you are to make your defense _and_ how you will answer. 













###### 15 






For I [Myself] will give you a mouth _and_ such utterance and wisdom that all of your foes combined will be unable to stand against or refute. 













###### 16 






You will be delivered up _and_ betrayed even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends, and [some] of you they will put to death. 













###### 17 






And you will be hated (despised) by everyone because [you bear] My name _and_ for its sake. 













###### 18 






But not a hair of your head shall perish. 













###### 19 






By your steadfastness _and_ patient endurance you [^d]shall win the [^e]true life of your souls. 













###### 20 






But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know _and_ understand that its desolation has come near. 













###### 21 






Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, and let those who are inside [the city] get out of it, and let not those who are out in the country come into it; 













###### 22 






For those are days of vengeance [of rendering full justice or satisfaction], that all things that are written may be fulfilled. 













###### 23 






Alas for those who are pregnant and for those who have babies which they are nursing in those days! For great misery _and_ anguish _and_ distress shall be upon the land and indignation _and_ punishment _and_ retribution upon this people. 













###### 24 






They will fall by [^f]the mouth _and_ the edge of the sword and will be led away as captives to _and_ among all nations; and Jerusalem will be trodden down by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled (completed). 













###### 25 






And there will be signs in the sun and moon and stars; and upon the earth [there will be] distress (trouble and anguish) of nations in bewilderment _and_ perplexity [[^g]without resources, left wanting, embarrassed, in doubt, not knowing which way to turn] at the roaring ([^h]the echo) of the tossing of the sea, 













###### 26 






Men swooning away _or_ expiring with fear _and_ dread _and_ apprehension and expectation of the things that are coming on the world; for the [very] powers of the heavens will be shaken _and_ [^i]caused to totter. 













###### 27 






And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with great (transcendent and overwhelming) power and [all His kingly] glory (majesty and splendor). 













###### 28 






Now when these things begin to occur, look up and lift up your heads, because your redemption (deliverance) is drawing near. 













###### 29 






And He told them a parable: Look at the fig tree and all the trees; 













###### 30 






When they put forth their buds _and_ come out in leaf, you see for yourselves and perceive _and_ know that summer is already near. 













###### 31 






Even so, when you see these things taking place, understand _and_ know that the kingdom of God is at hand. 













###### 32 






Truly I tell you, this generation ([^j]those living at that definite period of time) will not perish _and_ pass away until all has taken place. 













###### 33 






The [^k]sky and the earth ([^l]the universe, the world) will pass away, but My words will not pass away. 













###### 34 






But take heed to yourselves _and_ be on your guard, lest your hearts be overburdened _and_ depressed (weighed down) with the [^m]giddiness _and_ headache _and_ [^n]nausea of self-indulgence, drunkenness, and worldly worries _and_ cares pertaining to [the [^o]business of] this life, and [lest] that day come upon you suddenly like a trap _or_ a noose; 













###### 35 






For it will come upon all who live upon the face of the entire earth. 













###### 36 






Keep awake then _and_ watch at all times [be discreet, attentive, and ready], praying that you may have the full strength _and_ ability _and_ be accounted worthy to escape all these things [taken together] that will take place, and to stand in the presence of the Son of Man. 













###### 37 






Now in the daytime Jesus was teaching in [[^p]the porches and courts of] the temple, but at night He would go out and stay on the mount called Olivet. 













###### 38 






And early in the morning all the people came to Him in the temple [[^q]porches or courts] to listen to Him. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

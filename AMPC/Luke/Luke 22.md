# Luke 22

***














###### 1 






Now the Festival of Unleavened Bread was drawing near, which is called the Passover. 













###### 2 






And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to do away with [Jesus], for they feared the people. 













###### 3 






But [then] Satan entered into Judas, called Iscariot, who was one of the Twelve [apostles]. 













###### 4 






And he went away and discussed with the chief priests and captains how he might betray Him _and_ deliver Him up to them. 













###### 5 






And they were delighted and pledged [themselves] to give him money. 













###### 6 






So he agreed [to this], and sought an opportunity to betray Him to them [without an uprising] in the absence of the throng. 













###### 7 






Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover [lamb] had to be slain. 













###### 8 






So Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare for us the Passover meal, that we may eat it. 













###### 9 






They said to Him, Where do You want us to prepare [it]? 













###### 10 






He said to them, Behold, when you have gone into the city, a man carrying an earthen jug _or_ pitcher of water will meet you; follow him into the house which he enters, 













###### 11 






And say to the master of the house, The Teacher asks you, Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover [meal] with My disciples? 













###### 12 






And he will show you a large room upstairs, furnished [with carpets and with couches properly spread]; there make [your] preparations. 













###### 13 






And they went and found it [just] as He had said to them; and they made ready the Passover [supper]. 













###### 14 






And when the hour came, [Jesus] reclined at table, and the apostles with Him. 













###### 15 






And He said to them, I have earnestly _and_ intensely desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer; 













###### 16 






For I say to you, I shall eat it no more until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God. 













###### 17 






And He took a cup, and when He had given thanks, He said, Take this and divide _and_ distribute it among yourselves; 













###### 18 






For I say to you that from now on I shall not drink of the fruit of the vine at all until the kingdom of God comes. 













###### 19 






Then He took a loaf [of bread], and when He had given thanks, He broke [it] and gave it to them saying, This is My body which is given for you; do this in remembrance of Me. 













###### 20 






And in like manner, He took the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament _or_ covenant [ratified] in My blood, which is shed (poured out) for you. 













###### 21 






But, behold, the hand of him who [^a]is now engaged in betraying Me is with Me on the table. 













###### 22 






For the Son of Man is going as it has been determined _and_ appointed, but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed _and_ delivered up! 













###### 23 






And they began to inquire among themselves which of them it was who was about to do this. 













###### 24 






Now [^b]an eager contention arose among them [as to] which of them was considered _and_ reputed to be the greatest. 













###### 25 






But Jesus said to them, The kings of the Gentiles [^c]are deified by them _and_ exercise lordship [[^d]ruling as emperor-gods] over them; and those in authority over them are called benefactors _and_ well-doers. 













###### 26 






But this is not to be so with you; on the contrary, let him who is the greatest among you become like the youngest, and him who is the chief _and_ leader like one who serves. 













###### 27 






For who is the greater, the one who reclines at table (the master), or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines at table? But I am in your midst as One Who serves. 













###### 28 






And you are those who have remained [throughout] _and_ persevered with Me in My trials; 













###### 29 






And as My Father has appointed a kingdom _and_ conferred it on Me, so do I confer on you [the privilege and decree], 













###### 30 






That you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. 













###### 31 






Simon, Simon (Peter), listen! Satan [^e]has asked excessively that [all of] you be given up to him [out of the power and keeping of God], that he might sift [all of] you like grain, 













###### 32 






But I have prayed especially for you [Peter], that your [own] faith may not fail; and when you yourself have turned again, strengthen _and_ establish your brethren. 













###### 33 






And [Simon Peter] said to Him, Lord, I am ready to go with You both to prison and to death. 













###### 34 






But Jesus said, I tell you, Peter, before a [single] cock shall crow this day, you will three times [utterly] deny that you know Me. 













###### 35 






And He said to them, When I sent you out with no purse or [provision] bag or sandals, did you lack anything? They answered, Nothing! 













###### 36 






Then He said to them, But now let him who has a purse take it, and also [his provision] bag; and let him who has no sword sell his mantle and buy a sword. 













###### 37 






For I tell you that this Scripture must yet be fulfilled in Me: And He was counted _and_ classed among the wicked (the outlaws, the criminals); for what is written about Me has its fulfillment [has reached its end and is finally settled]. 













###### 38 






And they said, Look, Lord! Here are two swords. And He said to them, It is enough. 













###### 39 






And He came out and went, as was His habit, to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples also followed Him. 













###### 40 






And when He came to the place, He said to them, Pray that you may not [at all] enter into temptation. 













###### 41 






And He withdrew from them about a stone's throw and knelt down and prayed, 













###### 42 






Saying, Father, if You are willing, remove this cup from Me; yet not My will, but [[^f]always] Yours be done. 













###### 43 






And there appeared to Him an angel from heaven, strengthening Him in spirit. 













###### 44 






And being in an agony [of mind], He prayed [all the] more earnestly _and_ intently, and His sweat became like great [^g]clots of blood dropping down upon the ground. 













###### 45 






And when He got up from prayer, He came to the disciples and found them sleeping from grief, 













###### 46 






And He said to them, Why do you sleep? Get up and pray that you may not enter [at all] into temptation. 













###### 47 






And while He was still speaking, behold, there came a crowd, and the man called Judas, one of the Twelve [apostles], was going before [leading] them. He drew near to Jesus to kiss Him, 













###### 48 






But Jesus said to him, Judas! Would you betray _and_ deliver up the Son of Man with a kiss? 













###### 49 






And when those who were around Him saw what was about to happen, they said, Lord, shall we strike with the sword? 













###### 50 






And one of them struck the bond servant of the high priest and cut off his ear, the right one. 













###### 51 






But Jesus said, Permit [^h]them to go so far [as to seize Me]. And He touched the [^i]little (insignificant) ear and healed him. 













###### 52 






Then Jesus said to those who had come out against Him--the chief priests and captains of the temple and elders [of the Sanhedrin]--Have you come out with swords and clubs as [you would] against a robber? 













###### 53 






When I was with you day after day in the temple [[^j]enclosure], you did not stretch forth [your] hands against Me. But this is your hour--and the power [which] darkness [gives you has its way]. 













###### 54 






Then they seized Him and led Him away, bringing Him into the house of the high priest. Peter was following at a distance. 













###### 55 






And when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and were seated together, Peter sat among them. 













###### 56 






Then a servant girl, seeing him as he sat in the firelight and gazing [intently] at him, said, This man too was with [^k]Him. 













###### 57 






But he denied it and said, Woman, I do not know Him! 













###### 58 






And a little later someone else saw him and said, You are one of them also. But Peter said, Man, I am not! 













###### 59 






And when about an hour more had elapsed, still another emphatically insisted, It is the truth that this man also was with Him, for he too is a Galilean! 













###### 60 






But Peter said, Man, I do not know what you are talking about. And instantly, while he was still speaking, the cock crowed. 













###### 61 






And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter recalled the Lord's words, how He had told him, Before the cock crows today, you will deny Me thrice. 













###### 62 






And he went out and wept bitterly [that is, with painfully moving grief]. 













###### 63 






Now the men who had Jesus in custody treated Him with contempt _and_ scoffed at _and_ ridiculed Him and beat Him; 













###### 64 






They blindfolded Him also and asked Him, Prophesy! Who is it that struck [^l]You? 













###### 65 






And they said many other evil _and_ slanderous _and_ insulting words against Him, reviling Him. 













###### 66 






As soon as it was day, the assembly of the elders of the people gathered together, both chief priests and scribes; and they led Him into their council (the Sanhedrin), and they said, 













###### 67 






If You are the Christ (the Messiah), tell us. But He said to them, If I tell you, you will not believe (trust in, cleave to, and rely on what I say), 













###### 68 






And if I question you, you will not answer. 













###### 69 






But hereafter (from this time on), the Son of Man shall be seated at the right hand of the power of God. 













###### 70 






And they all said, You are the Son of God, then? And He said to them, [^m]It is just as you say; I Am. 













###### 71 






And they said, What further evidence do we need? For we have heard [it] ourselves from His own mouth! ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

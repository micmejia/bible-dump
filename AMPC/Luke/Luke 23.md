# Luke 23

***














###### 1 






Then the whole assembly of them got up and conducted [Jesus] before Pilate. 













###### 2 






And they began to accuse Him, asserting, We found this [^a]Man perverting (misleading, corrupting, and turning away) our nation and forbidding to pay tribute to Caesar, saying that He Himself is Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One), a King! 













###### 3 






So Pilate asked Him, Are You the King of the Jews? And He answered him, [[^b]It is just as] you say. [I Am.] 













###### 4 






And Pilate said to the chief priests and the throngs, I find no guilt _or_ crime in this Man. 













###### 5 






But they were urgent _and_ emphatic, saying, He stirs up _and_ excites the people, teaching throughout all Judea--from Galilee, where He began, even to this place. 













###### 6 






Upon hearing this, Pilate asked whether the Man was a Galilean. 













###### 7 






And when he found out [certainly] that He belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent Him up to Herod [a higher authority], who was also in Jerusalem in those days. 













###### 8 






Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad, for he had eagerly desired to see Him for a long time because of what he had heard concerning Him, and he was hoping to witness some sign (some striking evidence or spectacular performance) done by Him. 













###### 9 






So he asked Him many questions, but He made no reply. 













###### 10 






Meanwhile, the chief priests and the scribes stood by, continuing vehemently _and_ violently to accuse Him. 













###### 11 






And Herod, with his soldiers, treated Him with contempt and scoffed at _and_ ridiculed Him; then, dressing Him up in bright _and_ gorgeous apparel, he sent Him back to Pilate. 













###### 12 






And that very day Herod and Pilate became friends with each other--[though] they had been at enmity before this. 













###### 13 






Pilate then called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, 













###### 14 






And said to them, You brought this Man before me as One Who was perverting _and_ misleading _and_ [^c]turning away _and_ corrupting the people; and behold, after examining Him before you, I have not found any offense (crime or guilt) in this Man in regard to your accusations against Him; 













###### 15 






No, nor indeed did Herod, for he sent Him back to us; behold, He has done nothing deserving of death. 













###### 16 






I will therefore chastise Him _and_ [^d]deliver Him amended (reformed, taught His lesson) and release Him. 













###### 17 






[^e]_For it was necessary for him to release to them one prisoner at the Feast_. 













###### 18 






But they all together raised a deep cry [from the depths of their throats], saying, Away with this Man! Release to us Barabbas! 













###### 19 






He was a man who had been thrown into prison for raising a riot in the city, and for murder. 













###### 20 






Once more Pilate called to them, wishing to release Jesus; 













###### 21 






But they kept shouting out, Crucify, crucify Him! 













###### 22 






A third time he said to them, Why? What wrong has He done? I have found [no offense or crime or guilt] in Him nothing deserving of death; I will therefore chastise Him [[^f]in order to teach Him better] and release Him. 













###### 23 






But they were insistent _and_ urgent, demanding with loud cries that He should be crucified. And their voices prevailed (accomplished their purpose). 













###### 24 






And Pilate gave sentence, that what they asked should be done. 













###### 25 






So he released the man who had been thrown into prison for riot and murder, for whom they continued to ask, but Jesus he delivered up to be done with as they willed. 













###### 26 






And as they led Him away, they seized one Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, and laid on him the cross and made him carry it behind Jesus. 













###### 27 






And there accompanied [Jesus] a great multitude of the people, [including] women who bewailed and lamented Him. 













###### 28 






But Jesus, turning toward them, said, Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for Me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. 













###### 29 






For behold, the days are coming during which they will say, Blessed (happy, fortunate, and [^g]to be envied) are the barren, and the wombs that have not borne, and the breasts that have never nursed [babies]! 













###### 30 






Then they will begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us! and to the hills, Cover (conceal, hide) us! 













###### 31 






For if they do these things when the timber is green, what will happen when it is dry? 













###### 32 






Two others also, who were criminals, were led away to be executed with Him. 













###### 33 






And when they came to the place which is called The Skull [Latin: Calvary; Hebrew: Golgotha], there they crucified Him, and [along with] the criminals, one on the right and one on the left. 













###### 34 






And Jesus prayed, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. And they divided His garments _and_ distributed them by casting lots for them. 













###### 35 






Now the people stood by [[^h]calmly and leisurely] watching; but the rulers scoffed _and_ sneered ([^i]turned up their noses) at Him, saying, He rescued others [[^j]from death]; let Him now rescue Himself, if He is the Christ (the Messiah) of God, His Chosen One! 













###### 36 






The soldiers also ridiculed _and_ made sport of Him, coming up and offering Him vinegar (a sour wine mixed with water) 













###### 37 






And saying, If you are the King of the Jews, save (rescue) Yourself [[^k]from death]. 













###### 38 






For there was also an inscription above Him [^l]_in letters of Greek and Latin and Hebrew_: This is the King of the Jews. 













###### 39 






One of the criminals who was suspended kept up a railing at Him, saying, Are You not the Christ (the Messiah)? Rescue Yourself and us [[^m]from death]! 













###### 40 






But the other one reproved him, saying, Do you not even fear God, seeing you yourself are under the same sentence of condemnation _and_ suffering the same penalty? 













###### 41 






And we indeed suffer it justly, receiving the due reward of our actions; but this Man has done nothing out of the way [nothing [^n]strange or eccentric or perverse or unreasonable]. 













###### 42 






Then he said to Jesus, _Lord_, remember me when You come [^o]in Your kingly glory! 













###### 43 






And He answered him, Truly I tell you, today you shall be with Me in Paradise. 













###### 44 






It was now about the sixth hour (midday), and darkness enveloped the whole land _and_ earth until the ninth hour (about three o'clock in the afternoon), 













###### 45 






While the sun's light faded _or_ [^p]_was darkened_; and the curtain [of the Holy of Holies] of the temple was torn in two. 













###### 46 






And Jesus, crying out with a loud voice, said, Father, into Your hands I commit My spirit! And with these words, He expired. 













###### 47 






Now the centurion, having seen what had taken place, [^q]recognized God _and_ thanked _and_ praised Him, and said, Indeed, without question, this Man was upright (just and innocent)! 













###### 48 






And all the throngs that had gathered to see this spectacle, when they saw what had taken place, returned to their homes, beating their breasts. 













###### 49 






And all the acquaintances of [Jesus] and the women who had followed Him from Galilee stood at a distance and watched these things. 













###### 50 






Now notice, there was a man named Joseph from the Jewish town of Arimathea. He was a member of the council (the Sanhedrin), and a good (upright, [^r]advantageous) man, and righteous (in right standing with God and man), 













###### 51 






Who had not agreed with _or_ assented to the purpose and action of the others; and he was expecting _and_ waiting for the kingdom of God. 













###### 52 






This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. 













###### 53 






Then he took it down and [^s]rolled it up in a linen cloth [^t]for swathing dead bodies and laid Him in a rock-hewn tomb, where no one had ever yet been laid. 













###### 54 






It was the day of Preparation [for the Sabbath], and the Sabbath was dawning (approaching). 













###### 55 






The women who had come with [Jesus] from Galilee followed closely and saw the tomb and how His body was laid. 













###### 56 






Then they went back and made ready spices and ointments (perfumes). On the Sabbath day they rested in accordance with the commandment. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

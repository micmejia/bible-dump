# Mark 14

***














###### 1 






It was now two days before the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread, and the chief priests and the scribes were all the while seeking to arrest [Jesus] by secrecy _and_ deceit and put [Him] to death, 













###### 2 






For they kept saying, It must not be during the Feast, for fear that there might be a riot of the people. 













###### 3 






And while He was in Bethany, [a guest] in the house of Simon the leper, as He was reclining [at table], a woman came with an alabaster jar of ointment ([^a]perfume) of pure nard, very costly _and_ precious; and she broke the jar and poured [the perfume] over His head. 













###### 4 






But there were some who were moved with indignation and said to themselves, To what purpose was the ointment ([^b]perfume) thus wasted? 













###### 5 






For it was possible to have sold this [perfume] for more than 300 denarii [a laboring man's wages for a year] and to have given [the money] to the poor. And they censured _and_ reproved her. 













###### 6 






But Jesus said, Let her alone; why are you troubling her? She has done a good _and_ beautiful thing to Me [praiseworthy and noble]. 













###### 7 






For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you wish you can do good to them; but you will not always have Me. 













###### 8 






She has done what she could; she came beforehand to anoint My body for the burial. 













###### 9 






And surely I tell you, wherever the good news (the Gospel) is proclaimed in the entire world, what she has done will be told in memory of her. 













###### 10 






Then Judas Iscariot, who was one of the Twelve [apostles], went off to the chief priests in order to betray _and_ hand Him over to them. 













###### 11 






And when they heard it, they rejoiced _and_ were delighted, and they promised to give him money. And he [busying himself continually] sought an opportunity to betray Him. 













###### 12 






On the first day [of the Feast] of Unleavened Bread, when [as was customary] they killed the Passover lamb, [Jesus'] disciples said to Him, Where do You wish us to go [and] prepare the Passover [supper] for You to eat? 













###### 13 






And He sent two of His disciples and said to them, Go into the city, and a man carrying an [earthen] jar _or_ pitcher of water will meet you; follow him. 













###### 14 






And whatever [house] he enters, say to the master of the house, The Teacher says: Where is My guest room, where I may eat the Passover [supper] with My disciples? 













###### 15 






And he will [himself] show you a large upper room, furnished [with carpets and with dining couches properly spread] and ready; there prepare for us. 













###### 16 






Then the disciples set out and came to the city and found [everything] just as He had told them; and they prepared the Passover. 













###### 17 






And when it was evening, He came with the Twelve [apostles]. 













###### 18 






And while they were at the table eating, Jesus said, Surely I say to you, one of you will betray Me, [one] who is eating [here] with Me. 













###### 19 






And they began to show that they were sad _and_ hurt, and to say to Him one after another, Is it I? _or_, It is not I, is it? 













###### 20 






He replied to them, It is one of the Twelve [apostles], one who is dipping [bread] into the [same deep] dish with Me. 













###### 21 






For the Son of Man is going as it stands written concerning Him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good (profitable and wholesome) for that man if he had never been born. 













###### 22 






And while they were eating, He took a loaf [of bread], praised God _and_ gave thanks _and_ asked Him to bless it to their use. [Then] He broke [it] and gave to them and said, Take. _Eat_. This is My body. 













###### 23 






He also took a cup [of the juice of grapes], and when He had given thanks, He gave [it] to them, and they all drank of it. 













###### 24 






And He said to them, This is My blood [which ratifies] the _new_ covenant, [the blood] which is being poured out for (on account of) many. 













###### 25 






Solemnly _and_ surely I tell you, I shall not again drink of the fruit of the vine till that day when I drink it [^c]of a new _and_ a higher quality in God's kingdom. 













###### 26 






And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. 













###### 27 






And Jesus said to them, You will all fall away _this night_ [that is, you will be caused to stumble and will begin to distrust and desert Me], for it stands written, I will strike the Shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered. 













###### 28 






But after I am raised [to life], I will go before you into Galilee. 













###### 29 






But Peter said to Him, Even if they all fall away _and_ are caused to stumble _and_ distrust _and_ desert You, yet I will not [do so]! 













###### 30 






And Jesus said to him, Truly I tell you, this very night, before a cock crows twice, you will utterly deny Me [disclaiming all connection with Me] three times. 













###### 31 






But [Peter] said more vehemently _and_ repeatedly, [Even] if it should be necessary for me to die with You, I will not deny _or_ disown You! And they all kept saying the same thing. 













###### 32 






Then they went to a place called Gethsemane, and He said to His disciples, Sit down here while I pray. 













###### 33 






And He took with Him Peter and James and John, and began to be [^d]struck with terror _and_ amazement and deeply troubled _and_ depressed. 













###### 34 






And He said to them, My soul is exceedingly sad (overwhelmed with grief) so that it almost kills Me! Remain here and keep awake _and_ be watching. 













###### 35 






And going a little farther, He fell on the ground and kept praying that if it were possible the [[^e]fatal] hour might pass from Him. 













###### 36 






And He was saying, Abba, [which means] Father, everything is possible for You. Take away this cup from Me; yet not what I will, but what You [will]. 













###### 37 






And He came back and found them sleeping, and He said to Peter, Simon, are you asleep? Have you not the strength to keep awake _and_ watch [with Me for] one hour? 













###### 38 






Keep awake _and_ watch and pray [constantly], that you may not enter into temptation; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. 













###### 39 






He went away again and prayed, saying the same words. 













###### 40 






And again He came back and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy; and they did not know what answer to give Him. 













###### 41 






And He came back a third time and said to them, Are you still sleeping and resting? It is enough [of that]! The hour has come. The Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinful men (men [^f]whose way or nature is to act in opposition to God). 













###### 42 






Get up, let us be going! See, My betrayer is at hand! 













###### 43 






And at once, while He was still speaking, Judas came, one of the Twelve [apostles], and with him a crowd of men with swords and clubs, [who came] from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders [of the Sanhedrin]. 













###### 44 






Now the betrayer had given them a signal, saying, The One I shall kiss is [the Man]; seize Him and lead [Him] away safely [so as to prevent His escape]. 













###### 45 






And when he came, he went up to Jesus immediately and said, Master! _Master_! and he [^g]embraced Him _and_ kissed Him fervently. 













###### 46 






And they threw their hands on Him and arrested Him. 













###### 47 






But one of the bystanders drew his sword and struck the bond servant of the high priest and cut off his ear. 













###### 48 






And Jesus said to them, Have you come out with swords and clubs as [you would] against a robber to capture Me? 













###### 49 






I was with you daily in the temple [[^h]porches and courts] teaching, and you did not seize Me; but [this has happened] that the Scriptures might be fulfilled. 













###### 50 






Then [His disciples], forsaking Him, fled, all [of them]. 













###### 51 






And a young man was following Him, with nothing but a linen cloth ([^i]sheet) thrown about [his] naked [body]; and they laid hold of him, 













###### 52 






But, leaving behind the linen cloth ([^j]sheet), he fled from them naked. 













###### 53 






And they led Jesus away to the high priest, and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes were gathered together. 













###### 54 






And Peter followed Him at a distance, even right into the courtyard of the high priest. And he was sitting [[^k]in the firelight] with the guards and warming himself at the fire. 













###### 55 






Now the chief priests and the entire council (the Sanhedrin) were constantly seeking [to get] testimony against Jesus with a view to condemning Him _and_ putting Him to death, but they did not find any. 













###### 56 






For many were repeatedly bearing false witness against Him, but their testimonies did not agree. 













###### 57 






And some stood up and were bearing false witness against Him, saying, 













###### 58 






We heard Him say, I will destroy this temple (sanctuary) which is made with hands, and in three days I will build another, made without hands. 













###### 59 






Still not even [in this] did their testimony agree. 













###### 60 






And the high priest stood up in the midst and asked Jesus, Have You not even one answer to make? What [about this which] these [men] are testifying against You? 













###### 61 






But He kept still and did not answer at all. Again the high priest asked Him, Are You the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One), the Son of the Blessed? 













###### 62 






And Jesus said, I Am; and you will [all] see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power ([^l]the Almighty) and coming on the clouds of heaven. 













###### 63 






Then the high priest tore his garments and said, What need have we for more witnesses? 













###### 64 






You have heard His blasphemy. What is your decision? And they all condemned Him as being guilty _and_ deserving of death. 













###### 65 






And some of them began to spit on Him and to blindfold Him and to strike Him with their fists, saying to Him, Prophesy! And the guards received Him with blows _and_ by slapping Him. 













###### 66 






While Peter was down below in the courtyard, one of the [serving] maids of the high priest came; 













###### 67 






And when she saw Peter warming himself, she gazed intently at him and said, You were with Jesus of Nazareth too. 













###### 68 






But he denied it [^m]falsely _and_ disowned Him, saying, I neither know nor understand what you say. Then he went outside [the courtyard and was] into the [^n]vestibule. [^o]_And a cock crowed_. 













###### 69 






And the maidservant saw him, and began again to say to the bystanders, This [man] is [one] of them. 













###### 70 






But again he denied it [^p]falsely _and_ disowned Him. And after a short while, again the bystanders said to Peter, [^q]Really, you are one of them, for you are a Galilean [^r]_and your dialect shows it_. 













###### 71 






Then he commenced invoking a curse on himself [should he not be telling the truth] and swearing, I do not know the Man about Whom you are talking! 













###### 72 






And at once for the second time a cock crowed. And Peter remembered how Jesus said to him, Before a cock crows twice, you will [^s]utterly deny Me [disclaiming all connection with Me] three times. And [^t]having put his thought upon it [and remembering], he broke down _and_ wept aloud _and_ [^u]lamented.

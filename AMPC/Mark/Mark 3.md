# Mark 3

***














###### 1 






Again Jesus went into a synagogue, and a man was there who had one withered hand [[^a]as the result of accident or disease]. 













###### 2 






And [the Pharisees] kept watching Jesus [closely] to see whether He would cure him on the Sabbath, so that they might get a charge to bring against Him [[^b]formally]. 













###### 3 






And He said to the man who had the withered hand, Get up [and stand here] in the midst. 













###### 4 






And He said to them, Is it lawful _and_ right on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to take it? But they kept silence. 













###### 5 






And He glanced around at them with vexation _and_ anger, grieved at the hardening of their hearts, and said to the man, Hold out your hand. He held it out, and his hand was [completely] restored. 













###### 6 






Then the Pharisees went out and immediately held a consultation with the Herodians against Him, how they might [devise some means to] put Him to death. 













###### 7 






And Jesus retired with His disciples to the lake, and a great throng from Galilee followed Him. Also from Judea 













###### 8 






And from Jerusalem and Idumea and from beyond the Jordan and from about Tyre and Sidon--a vast multitude, hearing all the many things that He was doing, came to Him. 













###### 9 






And He told His disciples to have a little boat in [constant] readiness for Him because of the crowd, lest they press hard upon Him _and_ crush Him. 













###### 10 






For He had healed so many that all who had distressing bodily diseases kept falling upon Him _and_ pressing upon Him in order that they might touch Him. 













###### 11 






And the spirits, the unclean ones, [^c]as often as they might see Him, fell down before Him and kept screaming out, You are the Son of God! 













###### 12 






And He charged them strictly _and_ severely under penalty again _and_ again that they should not make Him known. 













###### 13 






And He went up on the hillside and called to Him [[^d]for Himself] those whom He wanted _and_ chose, and they came to Him. 













###### 14 






And He appointed twelve to [^e]continue to be with Him, and that He might send them out to preach [as apostles or special messengers] 













###### 15 






And to have authority _and_ power to _heal the sick and to_ drive out demons: 













###### 16 






[They were] Simon, and He surnamed [him] Peter; 













###### 17 






James son of Zebedee and John the brother of James, and He surnamed them Boanerges, that is, Sons of Thunder; 













###### 18 






And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew (Nathaniel), and Matthew, and Thomas, and James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus (Judas, not Iscariot), and Simon the Cananaean [also called Zelotes], 













###### 19 






And Judas Iscariot, he who betrayed Him. 













###### 20 






Then He went to a house [probably Peter's], but a throng came together again, so that Jesus and His disciples could not even take food. 













###### 21 






And when those [^f]who belonged to Him ([^g]His kinsmen) heard it, they went out to take Him by force, for they kept saying, He is out of [^h]His mind (beside Himself, deranged)! 













###### 22 






And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, He is possessed by Beelzebub, and, By [the help of] the prince of demons He is casting out demons. 













###### 23 






And He summoned them to Him and said to them in parables (illustrations or comparisons put beside truths to explain them), How can Satan drive out Satan? 













###### 24 






And if a kingdom is divided _and_ rebelling against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. 













###### 25 






And if a house is divided (split into factions and rebelling) against itself, that house will not be able to last. 













###### 26 






And if Satan has raised an insurrection against himself and is divided, he cannot stand but is [surely] coming to an end. 













###### 27 






But no one can go into a strong man's house and ransack his household goods right and left _and_ seize them as plunder unless he first binds the strong man; then indeed he may [thoroughly] plunder his house. 













###### 28 






Truly _and_ solemnly I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever abusive _and_ blasphemous things they utter; 













###### 29 






But whoever speaks abusively against _or_ maliciously misrepresents the Holy Spirit can never get forgiveness, but is guilty of _and_ is in the grasp of [^i]an everlasting trespass. 













###### 30 






For they [^j]persisted in saying, [^k]He has an unclean spirit. 













###### 31 






Then His mother and His brothers came and, standing outside, they sent word to Him, calling [for] Him. 













###### 32 






And a crowd was sitting around Him, and they said to Him, Your mother and Your brothers _and Your sisters_ are outside asking for You. 













###### 33 






And He replied, Who are My mother and My brothers? 













###### 34 






And looking around on those who sat in a circle about Him, He said, See! Here are My mother and My brothers; 













###### 35 






For whoever does the things God wills is My brother and sister and mother! ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Mark 7

***














###### 1 






Now there gathered together to [Jesus] the Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem, 













###### 2 






For they had seen that some of His disciples ate with [^a]common hands, that is, unwashed [with hands defiled and unhallowed, because they had not given them a [^b]ceremonial washing]-- 













###### 3 






For the Pharisees and all of the Jews do not eat unless [merely for ceremonial reasons] they wash their hands [diligently [^c]up to the elbow] with clenched fist, adhering [carefully and faithfully] to the tradition of [practices and customs handed down to them by] their forefathers [to be observed]. 













###### 4 






And [when they come] from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they purify themselves; and there are many other traditions [oral, man-made laws handed down to them, which they observe faithfully and diligently, such as], the washing of cups and wooden pitchers and widemouthed jugs and utensils of copper and [^d]beds-- 













###### 5 






And the Pharisees and scribes kept asking [Jesus], Why do Your disciples not order their way of living according to the tradition handed down by the forefathers [to be observed], but eat with hands unwashed _and_ ceremonially not purified? 













###### 6 






But He said to them, Excellently _and_ truly [[^e]so that there will be no room for blame] did Isaiah prophesy of you, the pretenders _and_ hypocrites, as it stands written: These people [constantly] honor Me with their lips, but their hearts hold off _and_ are far distant from Me. 













###### 7 






In vain (fruitlessly and without profit) do they worship Me, ordering _and_ teaching [to be obeyed] as doctrines the commandments _and_ precepts of men. 













###### 8 






You disregard _and_ give up _and_ ask to depart from you the commandment of God and cling to the tradition of men [keeping it carefully and faithfully]. 













###### 9 






And He said to them, You have a fine way of rejecting [thus thwarting and nullifying and doing away with] the commandment of God in order to keep your tradition (your own human regulations)! 













###### 10 






For Moses said, Honor (revere with tenderness of feeling and deference) your father and your mother, and, He who curses _or_ reviles _or_ speaks evil of _or_ abuses _or_ treats improperly his father or mother, let him surely die. 













###### 11 






But [as for you] you say, A man is exempt if he tells [his] father or [his] mother, What you would otherwise have gained from me [everything I have that would have been of use to you] is Corban, that is, is a gift [already given as an offering to God], 













###### 12 






Then you no longer are permitting him to do anything for [his] father or mother [but are letting him off from helping them]. 













###### 13 






Thus you are nullifying _and_ making void _and_ of no effect [the authority of] the Word of God through your tradition, which you [in turn] hand on. And many things of this kind you are doing. 













###### 14 






And He called the people to [Him] again and said to them, Listen to Me, all of you, and understand [what I say]. 













###### 15 






There is not [even] one thing outside a man which by going into him can pollute _and_ defile him; but the things which come out of a man are what defile him _and_ make him unhallowed _and_ unclean. 













###### 16 






[^f]_If any man has ears to hear, let him be listening [and let him_ [^g]_perceive and comprehend by hearing]._ 













###### 17 






And when He had left the crowd and had gone into the house, His disciples began asking Him about the parable. 













###### 18 






And He said to them, Then are you also unintelligent _and_ dull _and_ without understanding? Do you not discern _and_ see that whatever goes into a man from the outside cannot make him unhallowed _or_ unclean, 













###### 19 






Since it does not reach _and_ enter his heart but [only his] digestive tract, and so passes on [into the place designed to receive waste]? Thus He was making _and_ declaring all foods [ceremonially] clean [that is, [^h]abolishing the ceremonial distinctions of the Levitical Law]. 













###### 20 






And He said, What comes out of a man is what makes a man unclean _and_ renders [him] unhallowed. 













###### 21 






For from within, [that is] out of the hearts of men, come base _and_ wicked thoughts, sexual immorality, stealing, murder, adultery, 













###### 22 






Coveting (a greedy desire to have more wealth), dangerous _and_ destructive wickedness, deceit; [^i]unrestrained (indecent) conduct; an evil eye (envy), slander (evil speaking, malicious misrepresentation, abusiveness), pride ([^j]the sin of an uplifted heart against God and man), foolishness (folly, lack of sense, recklessness, thoughtlessness). 













###### 23 






All these evil [purposes and desires] come from within, and they make the man unclean _and_ render him unhallowed. 













###### 24 






And Jesus arose and went away from there to the region of Tyre _and Sidon_. And He went into a house and did not want anyone to know [that He was there]; but it was not possible for Him to be hidden [from public notice]. 













###### 25 






Instead, at once, a woman whose little daughter had (was under the control of) an unclean spirit heard about Him and came and flung herself down at His feet. 













###### 26 






Now the woman was a Greek (Gentile), a Syrophoenician by nationality. And she kept begging Him to drive the demon out of her little daughter. 













###### 27 






And He said to her, First let the children be fed, for it is not becoming _or_ proper _or_ right to take the children's bread and throw it to the [little house] dogs. 













###### 28 






But she answered Him, Yes, Lord, yet even the small pups under the table eat the little children's scraps of food. 













###### 29 






And He said to her, Because of this saying, you may go your way; the demon has gone out of your daughter [permanently]. 













###### 30 






And she went home and found the child thrown on the couch, and the demon departed. 













###### 31 






Soon after this, Jesus, coming back from the region of Tyre, passed through Sidon on to the Sea of Galilee, through the region of Decapolis [the ten cities]. 













###### 32 






And they brought to Him a man who was deaf and had difficulty in speaking, and they begged Jesus to place His hand upon him. 













###### 33 






And taking him aside from the crowd [privately], He thrust His fingers into the man's ears and spat and touched his tongue; 













###### 34 






And looking up to heaven, He sighed as He said, Ephphatha, which means, Be opened! 













###### 35 






And his ears were opened, his tongue was loosed, and he began to speak distinctly _and_ as he should. 













###### 36 






And Jesus [[^k]in His own interest] admonished _and_ ordered them sternly _and_ expressly to tell no one; but the more He commanded them, the more zealously they proclaimed it. 













###### 37 






And they were overwhelmingly astonished, saying, He has done everything excellently (commendably and nobly)! He even makes the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak!

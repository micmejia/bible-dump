# Matthew 10

***














###### 1 






And Jesus summoned to Him His twelve disciples and gave them power _and_ authority over unclean spirits, to drive them out, and to cure all kinds of disease and all kinds of weakness _and_ infirmity. 













###### 2 






Now these are the names of the twelve apostles (special messengers): first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James son of Zebedee, and John his brother; 













###### 3 






Philip and Bartholomew [Nathaniel]; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus [Judas, not Iscariot]; 













###### 4 






Simon the Cananaean, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him. 













###### 5 






Jesus sent out these twelve, charging them, Go nowhere among the Gentiles and do not go into any town of the Samaritans; 













###### 6 






But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. 













###### 7 






And as you go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand! 













###### 8 






Cure the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, drive out demons. Freely (without pay) you have received, freely (without charge) give. 













###### 9 






Take no gold nor silver nor [even] copper money in your purses (belts); 













###### 10 






And do not take a provision bag _or_ a [^a]wallet for a collection bag for your journey, nor two undergarments, nor sandals, nor a staff; for the workman deserves his support (his living, his food). 













###### 11 






And into whatever town or village you go, inquire who in it is deserving, and stay there [at his house] until you leave [that vicinity]. 













###### 12 






As you go into the house, give your greetings _and_ wish it well. 













###### 13 






Then if indeed that house is deserving, let come upon it your peace [that is, [^b]freedom from all the distresses that are experienced as the result of sin]. But if it is not deserving, let your peace return to you. 













###### 14 






And whoever will not receive _and_ accept _and_ welcome you nor listen to your message, as you leave that house or town, shake the dust [of it] from your feet. 













###### 15 






Truly I tell you, it shall be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town. 













###### 16 






Behold, I am sending you out like sheep in the midst of wolves; be [^c]wary _and_ wise as serpents, and be innocent (harmless, guileless, and [^d]without falsity) as doves. 













###### 17 






Be on guard against men [whose [^e]way or nature is to act in opposition to God]; for they will deliver you up to councils and flog you in their synagogues, 













###### 18 






And you will be brought before governors and kings for My sake, as a witness to bear testimony before them and to the Gentiles (the nations). 













###### 19 






But when they deliver you up, do not be anxious about how _or_ what you are to speak; for what you are to say will be given you in that very hour _and_ [^f]moment, 













###### 20 






For it is not you who are speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you. 













###### 21 






Brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child; and children will take a stand against their parents and will have them put to death. 













###### 22 






And you will be hated by all for My name's sake, but he who perseveres _and_ endures to the end will be saved [[^g]from spiritual disease and death in the world to come]. 













###### 23 






When they persecute you in one town [that is, pursue you in a manner that would injure you and cause you to suffer because of your belief], flee to another town; for truly I tell you, you will not have gone through all the towns of Israel before [^h] the Son of Man comes. 













###### 24 






A disciple is not above his teacher, nor is a servant _or_ slave above his master. 













###### 25 






It is sufficient for the disciple to be like his teacher, and the servant _or_ slave like his master. If they have called the Master of the house Beelzebub [[^i]master of the dwelling], how much more will they speak evil of those of His household. 













###### 26 






So have no fear of them; for nothing is concealed that will not be revealed, or kept secret that will not become known. 













###### 27 






What I say to you in the dark, tell in the light; and what you hear whispered in the ear, proclaim upon the housetops. 













###### 28 






And do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; but rather be afraid of Him who can destroy both soul and body in hell (Gehenna). 













###### 29 






Are not two [^j]little sparrows sold for a penny? And yet not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father's leave (consent) _and_ notice. 













###### 30 






But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. 













###### 31 






Fear not, then; you are of more value than many sparrows. 













###### 32 






Therefore, everyone who acknowledges Me before men _and_ confesses Me [[^k]out of a state of oneness with Me], I will also acknowledge him before My Father Who is in heaven _and_ [^l]confess [that I am abiding in] him. 













###### 33 






But whoever denies _and_ disowns Me before men, I also will deny _and_ disown him before My Father Who is in heaven. 













###### 34 






Do not think that I have come to bring peace upon the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword. 













###### 35 






For I have come to part asunder a man from his father, and a daughter from her mother, and a [^m]newly married wife from her mother-in-law-- 













###### 36 






And a man's foes will be they of his own household. 













###### 37 






He who loves [and [^n]takes more pleasure in] father or mother more than [in] Me is not worthy of Me; and he who loves [and takes more pleasure in] son or daughter more than [in] Me is not worthy of Me; 













###### 38 






And he who does not take up his cross and follow Me [[^o]cleave steadfastly to Me, conforming wholly to My example in living and, if need be, in dying also] is not worthy of Me. 













###### 39 






Whoever finds his [[^p]lower] life will lose it [the higher life], and whoever loses his [lower] life on My account will find it [the higher life]. 













###### 40 






He who receives _and_ welcomes _and_ accepts you receives _and_ welcomes _and_ accepts Me, and he who receives _and_ welcomes _and_ accepts Me receives _and_ welcomes _and_ accepts Him Who sent Me. 













###### 41 






He who receives _and_ welcomes _and_ accepts a prophet because he is a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward, and he who receives _and_ welcomes _and_ accepts a righteous man because he is a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward. 













###### 42 






And whoever gives to one of these little ones [in rank or influence] even a cup of cold water because he is My disciple, surely I declare to you, he shall not lose his reward.

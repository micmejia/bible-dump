# Matthew 13

***














###### 1 






That same day Jesus went out of the house and was sitting beside the sea. 













###### 2 






But such great crowds gathered about Him that He got into a boat and remained sitting there, while all the throng stood on the shore. 













###### 3 






And He told them many things in parables (stories by way of illustration and comparison), saying, A sower went out to sow. 













###### 4 






And as he sowed, some seeds fell by the roadside, and the birds came and ate them up. 













###### 5 






Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they had not much soil; and at once they sprang up, because they had no depth of soil. 













###### 6 






But when the sun rose, they were scorched, and because they had no root, they dried up _and_ withered away. 













###### 7 






Other seeds fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them out. 













###### 8 






Other seeds fell on good soil, and yielded grain--some a hundred times as much as was sown, some sixty times as much, and some thirty. 













###### 9 






He who has ears [to hear], let him be listening _and_ let him [^a]consider _and_ [^b]perceive _and_ comprehend by hearing. 













###### 10 






Then the disciples came to Him and said, Why do You speak to them in parables? 













###### 11 






And He replied to them, To you it has been given to know the secrets _and_ mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given. 













###### 12 






For whoever has [spiritual knowledge], to him will more be given _and_ he will [^c]be furnished richly so that he will have abundance; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away. 













###### 13 






This is the reason that I speak to them in parables: because [^d]having the power of seeing, they do not see; and [^e]having the power of hearing, they do not hear, nor do they grasp _and_ understand. 













###### 14 






In them indeed is [^f]the process of fulfillment of the prophecy of Isaiah, which says: You shall indeed hear _and_ hear but never grasp _and_ understand; and you shall indeed look _and_ look but never see _and_ perceive. 













###### 15 






For this nation's heart has grown gross (fat and dull), and their ears heavy _and_ difficult of hearing, and their eyes they have tightly closed, lest they see _and_ perceive with their eyes, and hear _and_ comprehend the sense with their ears, and grasp _and_ understand with their heart, and turn _and_ I should heal them. 













###### 16 






But blessed (happy, fortunate, and [^g]to be envied) are your eyes because they do see, and your ears because they do hear. 













###### 17 






Truly I tell you, many prophets and righteous men [men who were upright and in right standing with God] yearned to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it. 













###### 18 






Listen then to the [meaning of the] parable of the sower: 













###### 19 






[^h]While anyone is hearing the Word of the kingdom and does not grasp _and_ comprehend it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is what was sown along the roadside. 













###### 20 






As for what was sown on thin (rocky) soil, this is he who hears the Word and at once welcomes _and_ accepts it with joy; 













###### 21 






Yet it has no real root in him, but is temporary (inconstant, [^i]lasts but a little while); and when affliction _or_ trouble _or_ persecution comes on account of the Word, at once he is caused to stumble [he is repelled and [^j]begins to distrust and desert Him Whom he ought to trust and obey] _and_ he falls away. 













###### 22 






As for what was sown among thorns, this is he who hears the Word, but the cares of the world and the pleasure _and_ delight _and_ glamour _and_ deceitfulness of riches choke _and_ suffocate the Word, and it yields no fruit. 













###### 23 






As for what was sown on good soil, this is he who hears the Word and grasps _and_ comprehends it; he indeed bears fruit and yields in one case a hundred times as much as was sown, in another sixty times as much, and in another thirty. 













###### 24 






Another parable He set forth before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. 













###### 25 






But while he was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed also darnel (weeds resembling wheat) among the wheat, and went on his way. 













###### 26 






So when the plants sprouted and formed grain, the darnel (weeds) appeared also. 













###### 27 






And the servants of the owner came to him and said, Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? Then how does it have darnel shoots in it? 













###### 28 






He replied to them, An enemy has done this. The servants said to him, Then do you want us to go and weed them out? 













###### 29 






But he said, No, lest in gathering the wild wheat (weeds resembling wheat), you root up the [true] wheat along with it. 













###### 30 






Let them grow together until the harvest; and at harvest time I will say to the reapers, Gather the darnel first and bind it in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my granary. 













###### 31 






Another story by way of comparison He set forth before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field. 













###### 32 






Of all the seeds it is the smallest, but when it has grown it is the largest of the garden herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and find shelter in its branches. 













###### 33 






He told them another parable: The kingdom of heaven is like leaven ([^k]sour dough) which a woman took and covered over in three measures of meal _or_ flour till all of it was leavened. 













###### 34 






These things [^l]all taken together Jesus said to the crowds in parables; indeed, without a parable He said nothing to them. 













###### 35 






This was in fulfillment of what was spoken by the prophet: I will open My mouth in parables; I will utter things that have been hidden since the foundation of the world. 













###### 36 






Then He left the throngs and went into the house. And His disciples came to Him saying, Explain to us the parable of the darnel in the field. 













###### 37 






He answered, He Who sows the good seed is the Son of Man. 













###### 38 






The field is the world, and the good seed means the children of the kingdom; the darnel is the children of the evil one, 













###### 39 






And the enemy who sowed it is the devil. The harvest is the close _and_ consummation of the age, and the reapers are angels. 













###### 40 






Just as the darnel (weeds resembling wheat) is gathered and burned with fire, so it will be at the close of the age. 













###### 41 






The Son of Man will send forth His angels, and they will gather out of His kingdom all causes of offense [[^m]persons by whom others are drawn into error or sin] and all who do iniquity _and_ act wickedly, 













###### 42 






And will cast them into the furnace of fire; there will be weeping _and_ wailing and grinding of teeth. 













###### 43 






Then will the righteous (those who are upright and in right standing with God) shine forth like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Let him who has ears [to hear] be listening, _and_ let him [^n]consider _and_ perceive _and_ understand by hearing. 













###### 44 






The kingdom of heaven is like [^o]something precious buried in a field, which a man found and hid again; then in his joy he goes and sells all he has and buys that field. 













###### 45 






Again the kingdom of heaven is like a man who is a dealer in search of fine _and_ [^p]precious pearls, 













###### 46 






Who, on finding a single pearl of great price, went and sold all he had and bought it. 













###### 47 






Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a [^q]dragnet which was cast into the sea and gathered in fish of every sort. 













###### 48 






When it was full, men dragged it up on the beach, and sat down and sorted out the good fish into baskets, but the worthless ones they threw away. 













###### 49 






So it will be at the close _and_ consummation of the age. The angels will go forth and separate the wicked from the righteous (those who are upright and in right standing with God) 













###### 50 






And cast them [the wicked] into the furnace of fire; there will be weeping _and_ wailing and grinding of teeth. 













###### 51 






Have you understood [^r]all these things [parables] taken together? They said to Him, Yes, _Lord_. 













###### 52 






He said to them, Therefore every [^s]teacher _and_ interpreter of the Sacred Writings who has been instructed about _and_ trained for the kingdom of heaven and has [^t]become a disciple is like a householder who brings forth out of his storehouse treasure that is new and [treasure that is] old [the fresh as well as the familiar]. 













###### 53 






When Jesus had finished these parables (these comparisons), He left there. 













###### 54 






And coming to His own country [Nazareth], He taught in their synagogue so that they were amazed with bewildered wonder, and said, Where did this [^u]Man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers? 













###### 55 






Is not this the carpenter's Son? Is not His mother called Mary? And are not His brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas? 













###### 56 






And do not all His sisters live here among us? Where then did this Man get all this? 













###### 57 






And they took offense at Him [they were repelled and hindered from acknowledging His authority, and caused to stumble]. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house. 













###### 58 






And He did not do many works of power there, because of their unbelief (their lack of faith [^v]in the divine mission of Jesus). ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

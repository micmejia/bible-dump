# Matthew 15

***














###### 1 






Then from Jerusalem came scribes and Pharisees and said, 













###### 2 






Why do Your disciples transgress _and_ violate the rules handed down by the elders of the past? For they do not practice [ceremonially] washing their hands before they eat. 













###### 3 






He replied to them, And why also do you transgress _and_ violate the commandment of God for the sake of the rules handed down to you by your forefathers (the elders)? 













###### 4 






For God commanded, Honor your father and your mother, and, He who curses _or_ reviles _or_ speaks evil of _or_ abuses _or_ treats improperly his father or mother, let him surely come to his end by death. 













###### 5 






But you say, If anyone tells his father or mother, What you would have gained from me [that is, the money and whatever I have that might be used for helping you] is already dedicated as a gift to God, then he is exempt _and_ no longer under obligation to honor _and_ help his father _or his mother_. 













###### 6 






So for the sake of your tradition (the rules handed down by your forefathers), you have set aside the Word of God [depriving it of force and authority and making it of no effect]. 













###### 7 






You pretenders (hypocrites)! Admirably _and_ truly did Isaiah prophesy of you when he said: 













###### 8 






These people _draw near Me with their mouths and_ honor Me with their lips, but their hearts hold off _and_ are far away from Me. 













###### 9 






Uselessly do they worship Me, for they teach as doctrines the commands of men. 













###### 10 






And Jesus called the people to Him and said to them, Listen and grasp _and_ comprehend this: 













###### 11 






It is not what goes into the mouth of a man that makes him unclean _and_ defiled, but what comes out of the mouth; this makes a man unclean _and_ defiles [him]. 













###### 12 






Then the disciples came and said to Him, Do You know that the Pharisees were displeased _and_ offended _and_ indignant when they heard this saying? 













###### 13 






He answered, Every plant which My heavenly Father has not planted will be torn up by the roots. 













###### 14 






Let them alone _and_ disregard them; they are blind guides _and_ teachers. And if a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a ditch. 













###### 15 






But Peter said to Him, Explain this [^a]proverb (this [^b]maxim) to us. 













###### 16 






And He said, Are you also even yet dull _and_ ignorant [without understanding and [^c]unable to put things together]? 













###### 17 






Do you not see _and_ understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the [^d]abdomen and so passes on into the place where discharges are deposited? 













###### 18 






But whatever comes out of the mouth comes from the heart, and this is what makes a man unclean _and_ defiles [him]. 













###### 19 






For out of the heart come evil thoughts (reasonings and disputings and designs) such as murder, adultery, sexual vice, theft, false witnessing, slander, _and_ irreverent speech. 













###### 20 






These are what make a man unclean _and_ defile [him]; but eating with unwashed hands does not make him unclean _or_ defile [him]. 













###### 21 






And going away from there, Jesus withdrew to the district of Tyre and Sidon. 













###### 22 






And behold, a woman who was a Canaanite from that district came out and, with a [loud, troublesomely urgent] cry, begged, Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David! My daughter is miserably _and_ distressingly _and_ cruelly possessed by a demon! 













###### 23 






But He did not answer her a word. And His disciples came and implored Him, saying, Send her away, for she is crying out after us. 













###### 24 






He answered, I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. 













###### 25 






But she came and, kneeling, worshiped Him and kept praying, Lord, help me! 













###### 26 






And He answered, It is not right (proper, becoming, or fair) to take the children's bread and throw it to the [^e]little dogs. 













###### 27 






She said, Yes, Lord, yet even the little pups ([^f]little whelps) eat the crumbs that fall from their [young] masters' table. 













###### 28 






Then Jesus answered her, O woman, great is your faith! Be it done for you as you wish. And her daughter was cured from that [^g]moment. 













###### 29 






And Jesus went on from there and passed along the shore of the Sea of Galilee. Then He went up into the hills and kept sitting there. 













###### 30 






And a great multitude came to Him, bringing with them the lame, the maimed, the blind, the dumb, and many others, and they put them down at His feet; and He cured them, 













###### 31 






So that the crowd was amazed when they saw the dumb speaking, the maimed made whole, the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they [^h]recognized _and_ praised _and_ thanked _and_ glorified the God of Israel. 













###### 32 






Then Jesus called His disciples to Him and said, I have pity _and_ sympathy _and_ am deeply moved for the crowd, because they have been with Me now three days and they have nothing [at all left] to eat; and I am not willing to send them away hungry, lest they faint _or_ become exhausted on the way. 













###### 33 






And the disciples said to Him, Where are we to get bread sufficient to feed so great a crowd in this isolated _and_ desert place? 













###### 34 






And Jesus asked them, How many loaves of bread do you have? They replied, Seven, and a few small fish. 













###### 35 






And ordering the crowd to recline on the ground, 













###### 36 






He took the seven loaves and the fish, and when He had given thanks, He broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people. 













###### 37 






And they all ate and were satisfied. And they gathered up seven [[^i]large provision] baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over. 













###### 38 






Those who ate were 4,000 men, not including the women and the children. 













###### 39 






Then He dismissed the crowds, got into the boat, and went to the district of Magadan.

# Matthew 17

***














###### 1 






And six days after this, Jesus took with Him Peter and James and John his brother, and led them up on a high mountain by themselves. 













###### 2 






And His appearance underwent a change in their presence; and His face shone [^a]clear and bright like the sun, and His clothing became as white as light. 













###### 3 






And behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, who kept talking with Him. 













###### 4 






Then Peter began to speak and said to Jesus, Lord, it is good _and_ delightful that we are here; if You approve, I will put up three booths here--one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah. 













###### 5 






While he was still speaking, behold, a shining cloud [[^b]composed of light] overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, This is My Son, My Beloved, with Whom I am [and [^c]have always been] delighted. Listen to Him! 













###### 6 






When the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces and were [^d]seized with alarm _and_ struck with fear. 













###### 7 






But Jesus came and touched them and said, Get up, and do not be afraid. 













###### 8 






And when they raised their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only. 













###### 9 






And as they were going down the mountain, Jesus cautioned _and_ commanded them, Do not mention to anyone what you have seen, until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead. 













###### 10 






The disciples asked Him, Then why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first? 













###### 11 






He replied, Elijah does come and will get everything restored _and_ ready. 













###### 12 






But I tell you that Elijah has come already, and they did not know _or_ recognize him, but did to him as they liked. So also the Son of Man is going to be treated _and_ suffer at their hands. 













###### 13 






Then the disciples understood that He spoke to them about John the Baptist. 













###### 14 






And when they approached the multitude, a man came up to Him, kneeling before Him and saying, 













###### 15 






Lord, do pity _and_ have mercy on my son, for he has epilepsy (is [^e]moonstruck) and he suffers terribly; for frequently he falls into the fire and many times into the water. 













###### 16 






And I brought him to Your disciples, and they were not able to cure him. 













###### 17 






And Jesus answered, O you unbelieving ([^f]warped, wayward, rebellious) and [^g]thoroughly perverse generation! How long am I to remain with you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring him here to Me. 













###### 18 






And Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of him, and the boy was cured instantly. 













###### 19 






Then the disciples came to Jesus and asked privately, Why could we not drive it out? 













###### 20 






He said to them, Because of the littleness of your faith [that is, your lack of [^h]firmly relying trust]. For truly I say to you, if you have faith [[^i]that is living] like a grain of mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, Move from here to yonder place, and it will move; and nothing will be impossible to you. 













###### 21 






[^j]_But this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting_. 













###### 22 






When they were going about here and there in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of Man is going to be turned over into the hands of men. 













###### 23 






And they will kill Him, and He will be raised [to life] again on the third day. And they were deeply _and_ exceedingly grieved _and_ distressed. 













###### 24 






When they arrived in Capernaum, the collectors of the half shekel [the temple tax] went up to Peter and said, Does not your Teacher pay the half shekel? 













###### 25 






He answered, Yes. And when he came home, Jesus spoke to him [about it] first, saying, What do you think, Simon? From whom do earthly rulers collect duties _or_ tribute--from their own sons or from others [^k]not of their own family? 













###### 26 






And when Peter said, From other people [^l]not of their own family, Jesus said to him, Then the sons are exempt. 













###### 27 






However, in order not to give offense _and_ cause them to stumble [that is, to cause them [^m]to judge unfavorably and unjustly] go down to the sea and throw in a hook. Take the first fish that comes up, and when you open its mouth you will find there a shekel. Take it and give it to them to pay the temple tax for Me and for yourself. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Matthew 19

***














###### 1 






Now when Jesus had finished saying these things, He left Galilee and went into the part of Judea that is beyond the Jordan; 













###### 2 






And great throngs accompanied Him, and He cured them there. 













###### 3 






And Pharisees came to Him and put Him to the test by asking, Is it lawful _and_ right to dismiss _and_ repudiate _and_ divorce one's wife for any _and_ [^a]every cause? 













###### 4 






He replied, Have you never read that He Who made them from the beginning made them male and female, 













###### 5 






And said, For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be united firmly (joined inseparably) to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh? 













###### 6 






So they are no longer two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man put asunder (separate). 













###### 7 






They said to Him, Why then did Moses command [us] to give a certificate of divorce and thus to dismiss _and_ repudiate a wife? 













###### 8 






He said to them, Because of the hardness (stubbornness and perversity) of your hearts Moses permitted you to dismiss _and_ repudiate _and_ divorce your wives; but from the beginning it has not been [^b]so [ordained]. 













###### 9 






I say to you: whoever dismisses (repudiates, divorces) his wife, except for unchastity, and marries another commits adultery, [^c]_and he who marries a divorced woman commits adultery_. 













###### 10 






The disciples said to Him, If the case of a man with his wife is like this, it is neither profitable _nor_ advisable to marry. 













###### 11 






But He said to them, Not all men can accept this saying, but it is for those to whom [the capacity to receive] it has been given. 













###### 12 






For there are eunuchs who have been born incapable of marriage; and there are eunuchs who have been made so by men; and there are eunuchs who have made themselves incapable of marriage for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let him who is able to accept this accept it. 













###### 13 






Then little children were brought to Jesus, that He might put His hands on them and pray; but the disciples rebuked those who brought them. 













###### 14 






But He said, Leave the children alone! Allow the little ones to come to Me, and do not forbid _or_ restrain _or_ hinder them, for of such [as these] is the kingdom of heaven _composed_. 













###### 15 






And He put His hands upon them, and then went on His way. 













###### 16 






And behold, there came a man up to Him, saying, Teacher, what excellent _and_ perfectly _and_ essentially good deed must I do to possess eternal life? 













###### 17 






And He said to him, Why do you ask Me about the perfectly _and_ essentially good? There is only One Who is good [perfectly and essentially]--God. If you would enter into the Life, you must continually keep the commandments. 













###### 18 






He said to Him, What [^d]sort of commandments? [Or, which ones?] And Jesus answered, You shall not kill, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, 













###### 19 






Honor your father and your mother, and, You shall love your neighbor as [you do] yourself. 













###### 20 






The young man said, I have observed all these _from my youth_; what still do I lack? 













###### 21 






Jesus answered him, If you would be perfect [that is, [^e]have that spiritual maturity which accompanies self-sacrificing character], go and sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have riches in heaven; and come, [^f]be My disciple [side with My party and follow Me]. 













###### 22 






But when the young man heard this, he went away sad (grieved and in much distress), for he had great possessions. 













###### 23 






And Jesus said to His disciples, Truly I say to you, it will be difficult for a rich man to get into the kingdom of heaven. 













###### 24 






Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to go into the kingdom of heaven. 













###### 25 






When the disciples heard this, they were utterly puzzled (astonished, bewildered), saying, Who then can be saved [[^g]from eternal death]? 













###### 26 






But Jesus looked at them and said, With men this is impossible, but all things are possible with God. 













###### 27 






Then Peter answered Him, saying, Behold, we have left [our] all and have become [^h]Your disciples [sided with Your party and followed You]. What then shall we receive? 













###### 28 






Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you, in the new age [the [^i]Messianic rebirth of the world], when the Son of Man shall sit down on the throne of His glory, you who have [become My disciples, sided with My party and] followed Me will also sit on twelve thrones and judge the twelve tribes of Israel. 













###### 29 






And anyone _and_ everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for My name's sake will receive [^j]many [even a hundred] times more and will inherit eternal life. 













###### 30 






But many who [now] are first will be last [then], and many who [now] are last will be first [then].

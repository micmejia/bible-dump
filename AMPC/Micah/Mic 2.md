# Micah 2

***














###### 1 






Woe to those who devise iniquity and work out evil upon their beds! When the morning is light, they perform _and_ practice it because it is in their power. 













###### 2 






They covet fields and seize them, and houses and take them away; they oppress _and_ crush a man and his house, a man and his inheritance. 













###### 3 






Therefore thus says the Lord: Behold, against this family I am planning a disaster from which you cannot remove your necks, nor will you be able to walk erect; for it will be an evil time. 













###### 4 






In that day shall they take up a [taunting] parable against you and wail with a doleful _and_ bitter lamentation and say, We are utterly ruined _and_ laid waste! [God] changes the portion of my people. How He removes it from me! He divides our fields [to the rebellious, our captors]. 













###### 5 






Therefore you shall have no one to cast a line by lot upon a plot [of ground] in the assembly of the Lord. 













###### 6 






Do not preach, say the prophesying false prophets; one should not babble _and_ harp on such things; disgrace will not overtake us [the reviling has no end]. 













###### 7 






O house of Jacob, shall it be said, Is the Spirit of the Lord restricted, impatient, _and_ shortened? Or are these [prophesied plagues] His doings? Do not My words do good to him who walks uprightly? 













###### 8 






But lately (yesterday) My people have stood up as an enemy [and have made Me their antagonist]. Off from the garment you strip the cloak of those who pass by in secure confidence of safety _and_ are averse to war. 













###### 9 






The women of My people you cast out from their pleasant houses; from their young children you take away My glory forever. 













###### 10 






Arise and depart, for this is not the rest [which was promised to the righteous in Canaan], because of uncleanness that works destruction, even a sharp _and_ grievous destruction. 













###### 11 






If a man walking in a spirit [of vanity] and in falsehood should lie and say, I will prophesy to you of wine and strong drink, O Israel, he would even be the acceptable prophet of this people! 













###### 12 






I will surely gather all of you, O Jacob; I will surely collect the remnant of Israel. I will bring them [Israel] together like sheep in a fold, like a flock in the midst of their pasture. They [the fold and the pasture] shall swarm with men _and_ hum with much noise. 













###### 13 






The Breaker [the Messiah] will go up before them. They will break through, pass in through the gate and go out through it, and their King will pass on before them, the Lord at their head.

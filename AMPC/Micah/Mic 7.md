# Micah 7

***














###### 1 






Woe is me! For I am as when the summer fruits have been gathered, as when the vintage grapes have been gleaned and there is no cluster to eat, no first-ripe fig for which my appetite craves. 













###### 2 






The godly man has perished from the earth, and there is none upright among men. They all lie in wait for blood; each hunts his brother with a net. 













###### 3 






Both their hands are put forth _and_ are upon what is evil to do it diligently; the prince and the judge ask for a bribe, and the great man utters his evil desire. Thus they twist between them [the course of justice]. 













###### 4 






The best of them is like a brier; the most upright _or_ the straightest is like a thorn hedge. The day of your watchmen, even of [God's] judgment _and_ your punishment, has come; now shall be their perplexity _and_ confusion. 













###### 5 






Trust not in a neighbor; put no confidence in a friend. Keep the doors of your mouth from her who lies in your bosom. 













###### 6 






For the son dishonors the father, the daughter rises up against her mother, the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law--a man's enemies are the men (members) of his own house. 













###### 7 






But as for me, I will look to the Lord _and_ confident in Him I will keep watch; I will wait with hope _and_ expectancy for the God of my salvation; my God will hear me. 













###### 8 






Rejoice not against me, O my enemy! When I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a light to me. 













###### 9 






I will bear the indignation of the Lord because I have sinned against Him, until He pleads my cause and executes judgment for me. He will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold His righteous deliverance. 













###### 10 






Then my enemy will see it, and shame will cover her who said to me, Where is the Lord your God? My eyes will see my desire upon her; now she will be trodden down as the mire of the streets. 













###### 11 






In the day that your walls are to be built [a day for building], in that day shall the boundary [of Israel] be far extended _and_ the decree [against her] be far removed. 













###### 12 






In that day they will come to you from Assyria and from the cities of Matzor [Egypt] and from Egypt even to the river [Euphrates], from sea to sea and from mountain to mountain. 













###### 13 






Yet shall the earth be desolate because of those who dwell in it, for the fruit of their doings. 













###### 14 






Rule _and_ feed Your people with Your rod _and_ scepter, the flock of Your inheritance who dwell alone in a forest in the midst of Carmel [a garden land]; they shall feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old. 













###### 15 






As in the days of your coming forth from the land of Egypt, I will show them marvelous things. 













###### 16 






The nations shall see [God's deliverance] and be ashamed of all their might [which cannot be compared to His]. They shall lay their hands upon their mouths in consternation; their ears shall be deaf. 













###### 17 






They shall lick the dust like a serpent; like crawling things of the earth they shall come trembling out of their strongholds _and_ close places. They shall turn _and_ come with fear _and_ dread to the Lord our God and shall be afraid _and_ stand in awe because of You [O Lord]. 













###### 18 






Who is a God like You, Who forgives iniquity and passes over the transgression of the remnant of His heritage? He retains not His anger forever, because He delights in mercy _and_ loving-kindness. 













###### 19 






He will again have compassion on us; He will subdue _and_ tread underfoot our iniquities. You will cast all _our_ sins into the depths of the sea. 













###### 20 






You will show Your faithfulness _and_ perform the sure promise to Jacob and loving-kindness _and_ mercy to Abraham, as You have sworn to our fathers from the days of old.

# Nahum 1

***














###### 1 






The burden _or_ oracle (the thing to be lifted up) concerning [^a]Nineveh [the capital of Assyria]. The book of the vision of Nahum of Elkosh. 













###### 2 






The Lord is a jealous God and avenging; the Lord avenges and He is full of wrath. The Lord takes vengeance on His adversaries and reserves wrath for His enemies. 













###### 3 






The Lord is slow to anger and great in power and will by no means clear the guilty. The Lord has His way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of His feet. 













###### 4 






He rebukes _and_ threatens the sea and makes it dry, and dries up all the rivers. Bashan [on the east] and Mount Carmel [on the west] wither, and [in the north] the blossom of Lebanon fades. 













###### 5 






The mountains tremble _and_ quake before Him and the hills melt away, and the earth is upheaved at His presence--yes, the world and all that dwell in it. 













###### 6 






Who can stand before His indignation? And who can stand up _and_ endure the fierceness of His anger? His wrath is poured out like fire, and the rocks are broken asunder by Him. 













###### 7 






The Lord is good, a Strength _and_ Stronghold in the day of trouble; He knows (recognizes, has knowledge of, and understands) those who take refuge _and_ trust in Him. 













###### 8 






But with an [^b]overrunning flood He will make a full end of [Nineveh's very] site and pursue His enemies into darkness. 













###### 9 






What do you devise _and_ [how mad is your attempt to] plot against the Lord? He will make a full end [of Nineveh]; affliction [which My people shall suffer from Assyria] shall not rise up the second time. 













###### 10 






For [the Ninevites] are as bundles of thorn branches [for fuel], and even while drowned in their drunken [carousing] they shall be consumed like stubble fully dry [in the day of the Lord's wrath]. 













###### 11 






There is one gone forth out of you [O Nineveh] who plots evil against the Lord, a villainous [^c]counselor [the king of Assyria, who counsels for wickedness and worthlessness]. 













###### 12 






Thus says the Lord: Though they be in full strength and likewise many, even so shall [the Assyrians] be cut down when [their evil counselor] shall pass away. Though I have afflicted you [Jerusalem], I will not cause you to be afflicted [for your past sins] any more. 













###### 13 






For now will I break his yoke from off you and will burst your bonds asunder. 













###### 14 






And the Lord has given a commandment concerning you [evil Assyrian counselor], that no more of your name shall be born _nor_ shall your name be perpetuated. Out of the house of your gods I will cut off the graven and molten images; I will make [their temple] your tomb, for you are vile _and_ despised. 













###### 15 






Behold! upon the mountains the feet of him who brings good tidings [telling of the Assyrian's death], who publishes peace! Celebrate your feasts, O Judah; perform your vows. For the wicked counselor [the king of Assyria] shall no more come against you _or_ pass through your land; he is utterly cut off. [Then the prophet Nahum sarcastically addresses his message to Nineveh:]

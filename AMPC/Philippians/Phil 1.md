# Philippians 1

***














###### 1 






Paul and Timothy, bond servants of Christ Jesus (the Messiah), to all the saints (God's consecrated people) in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the bishops (overseers) and deacons (assistants): 













###### 2 






Grace (favor and blessing) to you and [heart] peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah). 













###### 3 






I thank my God in all my remembrance of you. 













###### 4 






In every prayer of mine I always make my entreaty _and_ petition for you all with joy (delight). 













###### 5 






[I thank my God] for your fellowship (your [^a]sympathetic cooperation and contributions and partnership) in advancing the good news (the Gospel) from the first day [you heard it] until now. 













###### 6 






And I am convinced _and_ sure of this very thing, that He Who began a good work in you will continue until the day of Jesus Christ [right up to the time of His return], developing [that good work] _and_ perfecting _and_ bringing it to full completion in you. 













###### 7 






It is right _and_ appropriate for me to have this confidence _and_ feel this way about you all, because [^b]you have me in your heart _and_ I hold you in my heart as partakers _and_ sharers, one _and_ all with me, of grace (God's unmerited favor and spiritual blessing). [This is true] both when I am shut up in prison and when I am out in the defense and confirmation of the good news (the Gospel). 













###### 8 






For God is my witness how I long for _and_ [^c]pursue you all with love, in the tender mercy of Christ Jesus [Himself]! 













###### 9 






And this I pray: that your love may abound yet more and more _and_ extend to its fullest development in knowledge and all keen insight [that your love may [^d]display itself in greater depth of acquaintance and more comprehensive discernment], 













###### 10 






So that you may surely learn to sense what is vital, _and_ approve _and_ prize what is excellent _and_ of real value [recognizing the highest and the best, and distinguishing the moral differences], and that you may be untainted _and_ pure and unerring _and_ blameless [so that with hearts sincere and certain and unsullied, you may approach] the day of Christ [not stumbling _nor_ causing others to stumble]. 













###### 11 






May you abound in _and_ be filled with the fruits of righteousness (of right standing with God and right doing) which come through Jesus Christ (the Anointed One), to the honor and praise of God [[^e]that His glory may be both manifested and recognized]. 













###### 12 






Now I want you to know _and_ continue to rest assured, brethren, that what [has happened] to me [this imprisonment] has actually only served to advance _and_ give a renewed impetus to the [spreading of the] good news (the Gospel). 













###### 13 






So much is this a fact that throughout the whole imperial guard and to all the rest [here] my imprisonment has become generally known to be in Christ [that I am a prisoner in His service and for Him]. 













###### 14 






And [also] most of the brethren have derived fresh confidence in the Lord because of my chains and are much more bold to speak _and_ publish fearlessly the Word of God [acting with more freedom and indifference to the consequences]. 













###### 15 






Some, it is true, [actually] preach Christ (the Messiah) [for no better reason than] out of envy and rivalry (party spirit), but others are doing so out of a loyal spirit _and_ goodwill. 













###### 16 






[^f]The latter [proclaim Christ] out of love, because they recognize _and_ know that I am [providentially] put here for the defense of the good news (the Gospel). 













###### 17 






[^g]But the former preach Christ out of a party spirit, insincerely [out of no pure motive, but thinking to annoy me], supposing they are making my bondage more bitter _and_ my chains more galling. 













###### 18 






But what does it matter, so long as either way, whether in pretense [for personal ends] or in all honesty [for the furtherance of the Truth], Christ is being proclaimed? And in that I [now] rejoice, yes, and I shall rejoice [hereafter] also. 













###### 19 






For I am well assured _and_ indeed know that through your prayers and a [^h]bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ (the Messiah) this will turn out for my preservation (for the spiritual health and [^i]welfare of my own soul) _and_ avail toward the saving work of the Gospel. 













###### 20 






This is in keeping with my own eager desire _and_ persistent expectation _and_ hope, that I shall not disgrace myself _nor_ be put to shame in anything; but that with the utmost freedom of speech _and_ unfailing courage, now as always heretofore, Christ (the Messiah) will be magnified _and_ get glory _and_ praise in this body of mine _and_ be boldly exalted in my person, whether through (by) life or through (by) death. 













###### 21 






For me to live is Christ [His life in me], and to die is gain [the gain of the glory of eternity]. 













###### 22 






If, however, it is to be life in the flesh _and_ I am to live on here, that means fruitful service for me; so I can say nothing as to my personal preference [I cannot choose], 













###### 23 






But I am hard pressed between the two. My yearning desire is to depart (to be free of this world, to set forth) and be with Christ, for that is far, far better; 













###### 24 






But to remain in my body is more needful _and_ essential for your sake. 













###### 25 






Since I am convinced of this, I know that I shall remain and stay by you all, to promote your progress and joy in believing, 













###### 26 






So that in me you may have abundant cause for exultation _and_ glorying in Christ Jesus, through my coming to you again. 













###### 27 






Only be sure as citizens so to conduct yourselves [that] your manner of life [will be] worthy of the good news (the Gospel) of Christ, so that whether I [do] come and see you or am absent, I may hear this of you: that you are standing firm in united spirit _and_ purpose, striving side by side _and_ contending with a single mind for the faith of the glad tidings (the Gospel). 













###### 28 






And do not [for a moment] be frightened _or_ intimidated in anything by your opponents _and_ adversaries, for such [constancy and fearlessness] will be a clear sign (proof and seal) to them of [their impending] destruction, but [a sure token and evidence] of your deliverance _and_ salvation, and that from God. 













###### 29 






For you have been granted [the privilege] for Christ's sake not only to believe in (adhere to, rely on, and trust in) Him, but also to suffer in His behalf. 













###### 30 






So you are engaged in the same conflict which you saw me [wage] and which you now hear to be mine [still]. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

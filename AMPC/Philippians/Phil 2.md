# Philippians 2

***


###### 1 


So by whatever [appeal to you there is in our mutual dwelling in Christ, by whatever] strengthening _and_ consoling _and_ encouraging [our relationship] in Him [affords], by whatever persuasive incentive there is in love, by whatever participation in the [Holy] Spirit [we share], and by whatever depth of affection and compassionate sympathy, 


###### 2 


Fill up _and_ complete my joy by living in harmony _and_ being of the same mind _and_ one in purpose, having the same love, being in full accord and of one harmonious mind _and_ intention. 


###### 3 


Do nothing from factional motives [through contentiousness, strife, selfishness, or for unworthy ends] or prompted by conceit _and_ empty arrogance. Instead, in the true spirit of humility (lowliness of mind) let each regard the others as better than _and_ superior to himself [thinking more highly of one another than you do of yourselves]. 


###### 4 


Let each of you esteem _and_ look upon _and_ be concerned for not [merely] his own interests, but also each for the interests of others. 


###### 5 


Let this same attitude _and_ purpose _and_ [humble] mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus: [Let Him be your example in humility:] 


###### 6 


Who, although being essentially one with God _and_ in the form of God [possessing the fullness of the attributes which make God God], did not think this equality with God was a thing to be eagerly grasped _or_ retained, 


###### 7 


But stripped Himself [of all privileges and rightful dignity], so as to assume the guise of a servant (slave), in that He became like men _and_ was born a human being. 


###### 8 


And after He had appeared in human form, He abased _and_ humbled Himself [still further] and carried His obedience to the extreme of death, even the death of the cross! 


###### 9 


Therefore [because He stooped so low] God has highly exalted Him and has freely bestowed on Him the name that is above every name, 


###### 10 


That in (at) the name of Jesus every knee should (must) bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, 


###### 11 


And every tongue [frankly and openly] confess _and_ acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. 


###### 12 


Therefore, my dear ones, as you have always obeyed [my suggestions], so now, not only [with the enthusiasm you would show] in my presence but much more because I am absent, work out (cultivate, carry out to the goal, and fully complete) your own salvation with reverence _and_ awe and trembling (self-distrust, with serious caution, tenderness of conscience, watchfulness against temptation, timidly shrinking from whatever might offend God and discredit the name of Christ). 


###### 13 


[Not in your own strength] for it is God Who is all the while effectually at work in you [energizing and creating in you the power and desire], both to will and to work for His good pleasure _and_ satisfaction _and_ delight. 


###### 14 


Do all things without grumbling _and_ faultfinding _and_ complaining [against God] and questioning _and_ doubting [among yourselves], 


###### 15 


That you may show yourselves to be blameless _and_ guileless, innocent _and_ uncontaminated, children of God without blemish (faultless, unrebukable) in the midst of a crooked _and_ wicked generation [spiritually perverted and perverse], among whom you are seen as bright lights (stars or beacons shining out clearly) in the [dark] world, 


###### 16 


Holding out [to it] _and_ offering [to all men] the Word of Life, so that in the day of Christ I may have something of which exultantly to rejoice _and_ glory in that I did not run my race in vain or spend my labor to no purpose. 


###### 17 


Even if [my lifeblood] must be poured out as a libation on the sacrificial offering of your faith [to God], still I am glad [to do it] and congratulate you all on [your share in] it. 


###### 18 


And you also in like manner be glad and congratulate me on [my share in] it. 


###### 19 


But I hope _and_ trust in the Lord Jesus soon to send Timothy to you, so that I may also be encouraged _and_ cheered by learning news of you. 


###### 20 


For I have no one like him [no one of so kindred a spirit] who will be so genuinely interested in your welfare _and_ devoted to your interests. 


###### 21 


For the others all seek [to advance] their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ (the Messiah). 


###### 22 


But Timothy's tested worth you know, how as a son with his father he has toiled with me zealously in [serving and helping to advance] the good news (the Gospel). 


###### 23 


I hope therefore to send him promptly, just as soon as I know how my case is going to turn out. 


###### 24 


But [really] I am confident _and_ fully trusting in the Lord that shortly I myself shall come to you also. 


###### 25 


However, I thought it necessary to send Epaphroditus [back] to you. [He has been] my brother and companion in labor and my fellow soldier, as well as [having come as] your special messenger (apostle) and minister to my need. 


###### 26 


For he has been [homesick] longing for you all and has been distressed because you had heard that he was ill. 


###### 27 


He certainly was ill [too], near to death. But God had compassion on him, and not only on him but also on me, lest I should have sorrow [over him] coming upon sorrow. 


###### 28 


So I have sent him the more willingly _and_ eagerly, that you may be gladdened at seeing him again, and that I may be the less disquieted. 


###### 29 


Welcome him [home] then in the Lord with all joy, and honor _and_ highly appreciate men like him, 


###### 30 


For it was through working for Christ that he came so near death, risking his [very] life to complete the deficiencies in your service to me [which distance prevented you yourselves from rendering].

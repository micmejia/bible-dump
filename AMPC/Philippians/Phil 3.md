# Philippians 3

***


###### 1 


For the rest, my brethren, delight yourselves in the Lord _and_ continue to rejoice that you are in Him. To keep writing to you [over and over] of the same things is not irksome to me, and it is [a precaution] for your safety. 


###### 2 


Look out for those dogs [Judaizers, legalists], look out for those mischief-makers, look out for those who mutilate the flesh. 


###### 3 


For we [Christians] are the true circumcision, who worship God in spirit _and_ by the Spirit of God and exult _and_ glory _and_ pride ourselves in Jesus Christ, and put no confidence _or_ dependence [on what we are] in the flesh _and_ on outward privileges _and_ physical advantages _and_ external appearances-- 


###### 4 


Though for myself I have [at least grounds] to rely on the flesh. If any other man considers that he has _or_ seems to have reason to rely on the flesh _and_ his physical _and_ outward advantages, I have still more! 


###### 5 


Circumcised when I was eight days old, of the race of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew [and the son] of Hebrews; as to the observance of the Law I was of [the party of] the Pharisees, 


###### 6 


As to my zeal, I was a persecutor of the church, and by the Law's standard of righteousness (supposed justice, uprightness, and right standing with God) I was proven to be blameless _and_ no fault was found with me. 


###### 7 


But whatever former things I had that might have been gains to me, I have come to consider as [one combined] loss for Christ's sake. 


###### 8 


Yes, furthermore, I count everything as loss compared to the possession of the priceless privilege (the overwhelming preciousness, the surpassing worth, and supreme advantage) of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord _and_ of progressively becoming more deeply _and_ intimately acquainted with Him [of perceiving and recognizing and understanding Him more fully and clearly]. For His sake I have lost everything and consider it all to be mere rubbish (refuse, dregs), in order that I may win (gain) Christ (the Anointed One), 


###### 9 


And that I may [actually] be found _and_ known as in Him, not having any [self-achieved] righteousness that can be called my own, based on my obedience to the Law's demands (ritualistic uprightness and supposed right standing with God thus acquired), but possessing that [genuine righteousness] which comes through faith in Christ (the Anointed One), the [truly] right standing with God, which comes from God by [saving] faith. 


###### 10 


[For my determined purpose is] that I may know Him [that I may progressively become more deeply and intimately acquainted with Him, perceiving and recognizing and understanding the wonders of His Person more strongly and more clearly], and that I may in that same way come to know the power outflowing from His resurrection [which it exerts over believers], and that I may so share His sufferings as to be continually transformed [in spirit into His likeness even] to His death, [in the hope] 


###### 11 


That if possible I may attain to the [spiritual and moral] resurrection [that lifts me] out from among the dead [even while in the body]. 


###### 12 


Not that I have now attained [this ideal], or have already been made perfect, but I press on to lay hold of (grasp) _and_ make my own, that for which Christ Jesus (the Messiah) has laid hold of me _and_ made me His own. 


###### 13 


I do not consider, brethren, that I have captured _and_ made it my own [yet]; but one thing I do [it is my one aspiration]: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, 


###### 14 


I press on toward the goal to win the [supreme and heavenly] prize to which God in Christ Jesus is calling us upward. 


###### 15 


So let those [of us] who are spiritually mature _and_ full-grown have this mind _and_ hold these convictions; and if in any respect you have a different attitude of mind, God will make that clear to you also. 


###### 16 


Only let us hold true to what we have already attained _and_ walk _and_ order our lives by that. 


###### 17 


Brethren, together follow my example and observe those who live after the pattern we have set for you. 


###### 18 


For there are many, of whom I have often told you and now tell you even with tears, who walk (live) as enemies of the cross of Christ (the Anointed One). 


###### 19 


They are doomed _and_ their fate is eternal misery (perdition); their god is their stomach (their appetites, their sensuality) and they glory in their shame, siding with earthly things _and_ being of their party. 


###### 20 


But we are citizens of the state (commonwealth, homeland) which is in heaven, and from it also we earnestly _and_ patiently await [the coming of] the Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) [as] Savior, 


###### 21 


Who will transform _and_ fashion anew the body of our humiliation to conform to _and_ be like the body of His glory _and_ majesty, by exerting that power which enables Him even to subject everything to Himself.

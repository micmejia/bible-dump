# Philippians 4

***


###### 1 


Therefore, my brethren, whom I love and yearn to see, my delight and crown (wreath of victory), thus stand firm in the Lord, my beloved. 


###### 2 


I entreat _and_ advise Euodia and I entreat _and_ advise Syntyche to agree _and_ to work in harmony in the Lord. 


###### 3 


And I exhort you too, [my] genuine yokefellow, help these [two women to keep on cooperating], for they have toiled along with me in [the spreading of] the good news (the Gospel), as have Clement and the rest of my fellow workers whose names are in the Book of Life. 


###### 4 


Rejoice in the Lord always [delight, gladden yourselves in Him]; again I say, Rejoice! 


###### 5 


Let all men know _and_ perceive _and_ recognize your unselfishness (your considerateness, your forbearing spirit). The Lord is near [He is coming soon]. 


###### 6 


Do not fret _or_ have any anxiety about anything, but in every circumstance _and_ in everything, by prayer and petition (definite requests), with thanksgiving, continue to make your wants known to God. 


###### 7 


And God's peace [shall be yours, that tranquil state of a soul assured of its salvation through Christ, and so fearing nothing from God and being content with its earthly lot of whatever sort that is, that peace] which transcends all understanding shall garrison _and_ mount guard over your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus. 


###### 8 


For the rest, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is worthy of reverence _and_ is honorable _and_ seemly, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely _and_ lovable, whatever is kind _and_ winsome _and_ gracious, if there is any virtue _and_ excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think on _and_ weigh _and_ take account of these things [fix your minds on them]. 


###### 9 


Practice what you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, _and_ model your way of living on it, and the God of peace (of untroubled, undisturbed well-being) will be with you. 


###### 10 


I was made very happy in the Lord that now you have revived your interest in my welfare after so long a time; you were indeed thinking of me, but you had no opportunity to show it. 


###### 11 


Not that I am implying that I was in any personal want, for I have learned how to be  content (satisfied to the point where I am not disturbed or disquieted) in whatever state I am. 


###### 12 


I know how to be abased _and_ live humbly in straitened circumstances, and I know also how to enjoy plenty _and_ live in abundance. I have learned in any and all circumstances the secret of facing every situation, whether well-fed or going hungry, having a sufficiency _and_ enough to spare or going without _and_ being in want. 


###### 13 


I have strength for all things in Christ Who empowers me [I am ready for anything and equal to anything through Him Who infuses inner strength into me; I am self-sufficient in Christ's sufficiency]. 


###### 14 


But it was right _and_ commendable _and_ noble of you to contribute for my needs _and_ to share my difficulties with me. 


###### 15 


And you Philippians yourselves well know that in the early days of the Gospel ministry, when I left Macedonia, no church (assembly) entered into partnership with me _and_ opened up [a debit and credit] account in giving and receiving except you only. 


###### 16 


For even in Thessalonica you sent [me contributions] for my needs, not only once but a second time. 


###### 17 


Not that I seek _or_ am eager for [your] gift, but I do seek _and_ am eager for the fruit which increases to your credit [the harvest of blessing that is accumulating to your account]. 


###### 18 


But I have [your full payment] and more; I have everything I need _and_ am amply supplied, now that I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent me. [They are the] fragrant odor of an offering _and_ sacrifice which God welcomes _and_ in which He delights. 


###### 19 


And my God will liberally supply (fill to the full) your every need according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus. 


###### 20 


To our God and Father be glory forever and ever (through the endless eternities of the eternities). _Amen (so be it)._ 


###### 21 


Remember me to every saint (every born-again believer) in Christ Jesus. The brethren (my associates) who are with me greet you. 


###### 22 


All the saints (God's consecrated ones here) wish to be remembered to you, especially those of Caesar's household. 


###### 23 


The grace (spiritual favor and blessing) of the Lord Jesus Christ (the Anointed One) be with your spirit. _Amen (so be it)._

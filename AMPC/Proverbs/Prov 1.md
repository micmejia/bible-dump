# Proverbs 1

***














###### 1 






The proverbs (truths obscurely expressed, maxims, and parables) of Solomon son of David, king of Israel: 













###### 2 






[^a]That people may know skillful _and_ godly [^b]Wisdom and instruction, discern _and_ comprehend the words of understanding _and_ insight, 













###### 3 






Receive instruction in wise dealing _and_ the discipline of wise thoughtfulness, righteousness, justice, and integrity, 













###### 4 






That prudence may be given to the simple, and knowledge, discretion, _and_ discernment to the youth-- 













###### 5 






The wise also will hear and increase in learning, and the person of understanding will acquire skill _and_ attain to sound counsel [so that he may be able to steer his course rightly]-- 













###### 6 






That people may understand a proverb and a figure of speech _or_ an enigma with its interpretation, and the words of the wise and their dark sayings _or_ riddles. 













###### 7 






The reverent _and_ worshipful fear of the Lord is the beginning _and_ the principal _and_ choice part of knowledge [its starting point and its essence]; but fools despise skillful _and_ godly Wisdom, instruction, _and_ discipline. 













###### 8 






My son, hear the instruction of your father; reject not _nor_ forsake the teaching of your mother. 













###### 9 






For they are a [victor's] chaplet (garland) of grace upon your head and chains _and_ pendants [of gold worn by kings] for your neck. 













###### 10 






My son, if sinners entice you, do not consent. 













###### 11 






If they say, Come with us; let us lie in wait [to shed] blood, let us ambush the innocent without cause [and show that his piety is in vain]; 













###### 12 






Let us swallow them up alive as does Sheol (the place of the dead), and whole, as those who go down into the pit [of the dead]; 













###### 13 






We shall find _and_ take all kinds of precious goods [when our victims are put out of the way], we shall fill our houses with plunder; 













###### 14 






Throw in your lot with us [they insist] _and_ be a sworn brother _and_ comrade; let us all have one purse in common-- 













###### 15 






My son, do not walk in the way with them; restrain your foot from their path; 













###### 16 






For their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed blood. 













###### 17 






For in vain is the net spread in the sight of any bird! 













###### 18 






But [when these men set a trap for others] they are lying in wait for their own blood; they set an ambush for their own lives. 













###### 19 






So are the ways of everyone who is greedy of gain; such [greed for plunder] takes away the lives of its possessors. 













###### 20 






[^c]Wisdom cries aloud in the street, she raises her voice in the markets; 













###### 21 






She cries at the head of the noisy intersections [in the chief gathering places]; at the entrance of the city gates she speaks: 













###### 22 






How long, O simple ones [open to evil], will you love being simple? And the scoffers delight in scoffing and [self-confident] fools hate knowledge? 













###### 23 






If you will turn (repent) _and_ give heed to my reproof, behold, I [[^d]Wisdom] will pour out my spirit upon you, I will make my words known to you. 













###### 24 






Because I have called and you have refused [to answer], have stretched out my hand and no man has heeded it, 













###### 25 






And you treated as nothing all my counsel and would accept none of my reproof, 













###### 26 






I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when the thing comes that shall cause you terror _and_ panic-- 













###### 27 






When your panic comes as a storm _and_ desolation and your calamity comes on as a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come upon you. 













###### 28 






Then will they call upon me [Wisdom] but I will not answer; they will seek me early _and_ diligently but they will not find me. 













###### 29 






Because they hated knowledge and did not choose the reverent _and_ worshipful fear of the Lord, 













###### 30 






Would accept none of my counsel, and despised all my reproof, 













###### 31 






Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way and be satiated with their own devices. 













###### 32 






For the backsliding of the simple shall slay them, and the careless ease of [self-confident] fools shall destroy them. 













###### 33 






But whoso hearkens to me [Wisdom] shall dwell securely _and_ in confident trust and shall be quiet, without fear _or_ dread of evil. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: Proverbs 1:2 A key term in the book of Proverbs, “Wisdom” is capitalized throughout, as God’s design for living and as a reminder of Christ, Whom the apostle Paul calls “the wisdom of God... in Whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge” (I Cor. 1:24; Col. 2:3 kjv). [^c]: Proverbs 1:20 Wisdom here is personified. Read “the Wisdom of God” instead of “Wisdom” and see the wonderful power of this book. [^d]: Proverbs 1:23 See footnotes on Prov. 1:2 and 1:20.

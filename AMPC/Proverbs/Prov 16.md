# Proverbs 16

***














###### 1 






The plans of the mind _and_ orderly thinking belong to man, but from the Lord comes the [wise] answer of the tongue. 













###### 2 






All the ways of a man are pure in his own eyes, but the Lord weighs the spirits (the thoughts and intents of the heart). 













###### 3 






Roll your works upon the Lord [commit and trust them wholly to Him; He will cause your thoughts to become agreeable to His will, and] so shall your plans be established _and_ succeed. 













###### 4 






The Lord has made everything [to accommodate itself and contribute] to its own end _and_ His own purpose--even the wicked [are fitted for their role] for the day of calamity _and_ evil. 













###### 5 






Everyone proud _and_ arrogant in heart is disgusting, hateful, _and_ exceedingly offensive to the Lord; be assured [I pledge it] they will not go unpunished. 













###### 6 






By mercy _and_ love, truth _and_ fidelity [to God and man--not by sacrificial offerings], iniquity is purged out of the heart, and by the reverent, worshipful fear of the Lord men depart from _and_ avoid evil. 













###### 7 






When a man's ways please the Lord, He makes even his enemies to be at peace with him. 













###### 8 






Better is a little with righteousness (uprightness in every area and relation and right standing with God) than great revenues with injustice. 













###### 9 






A man's mind plans his way, but the Lord directs his steps _and_ makes them sure. 













###### 10 






Divinely directed decisions are on the lips of the king; his mouth should not transgress in judgment. 













###### 11 






A just balance _and_ scales are the Lord's; all the weights of the bag are His work [established on His eternal principles]. 













###### 12 






It is an abomination [to God and men] for kings to commit wickedness, for a throne is established _and_ made secure by righteousness (moral and spiritual rectitude in every area and relation). 













###### 13 






Right _and_ just lips are the delight of a king, and he loves him who speaks what is right. 













###### 14 






The wrath of a king is as messengers of death, but a wise man will pacify it. 













###### 15 






In the light of the king's countenance is life, and his favor is as a cloud bringing the spring rain. 













###### 16 






How much better it is to get skillful _and_ godly Wisdom than gold! And to get understanding is to be chosen rather than silver. 













###### 17 






The highway of the upright turns aside from evil; he who guards his way preserves his life. 













###### 18 






Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall. 













###### 19 






Better it is to be of a humble spirit with the meek _and_ poor than to divide the spoil with the proud. 













###### 20 






He who deals wisely _and_ heeds [God's] word _and_ counsel shall find good, and whoever leans on, trusts in, _and_ is confident in the Lord--happy, blessed, _and_ fortunate is he. 













###### 21 






The wise in heart are called prudent, understanding, _and_ knowing, and winsome speech increases learning [in both speaker and listener]. 













###### 22 






Understanding is a wellspring of life to those who have it, but to give instruction to fools is folly. 













###### 23 






The mind of the wise instructs his mouth, and adds learning _and_ persuasiveness to his lips. 













###### 24 






Pleasant words are as a honeycomb, sweet to the mind and healing to the body. 













###### 25 






There is a way that seems right to a man _and_ appears straight before him, but at the end of it is the way of death. 













###### 26 






The appetite of the laborer works for him, for [the need of] his mouth urges him on. 













###### 27 






A worthless man devises _and_ digs up mischief, and in his lips there is as a scorching fire. 













###### 28 






A perverse man sows strife, and a whisperer separates close friends. 













###### 29 






The exceedingly grasping, covetous, _and_ violent man entices his neighbor, leading him in a way that is not good. 













###### 30 






He who shuts his eyes to devise perverse things and who compresses his lips [as if in concealment] brings evil to pass. 













###### 31 






The hoary head is a crown of beauty _and_ glory if it is found in the way of righteousness (moral and spiritual rectitude in every area and relation). 













###### 32 






He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty, he who rules his [own] spirit than he who takes a city. 













###### 33 






The lot is cast into the lap, but the decision is wholly of the Lord [even the events that seem accidental are really ordered by Him]. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

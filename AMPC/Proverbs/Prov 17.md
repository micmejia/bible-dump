# Proverbs 17

***














###### 1 






Better is a dry morsel with quietness than a house full of feasting [on offered sacrifices] with strife. 













###### 2 






A wise servant shall have rule over a son who causes shame, and shall share in the inheritance among the brothers. 













###### 3 






The refining pot is for silver and the furnace for gold, but the Lord tries the hearts. 













###### 4 






An evildoer gives heed to wicked lips; and a liar listens to a mischievous tongue. 













###### 5 






Whoever mocks the poor reproaches his Maker, and he who is glad at calamity shall not be held innocent or go unpunished. 













###### 6 






Children's children are the crown of old men, and the glory of children is their fathers. 













###### 7 






Fine or arrogant speech does not befit [an empty-headed] fool--much less do lying lips befit a prince. 













###### 8 






A bribe is like a bright, precious stone that dazzles the eyes and affects the mind of him who gives it; [as if by magic] he prospers, whichever way he turns. 













###### 9 






He who covers and forgives an offense seeks love, but he who repeats or harps on a matter separates even close friends. 













###### 10 






A reproof enters deeper into a man of understanding than a hundred lashes into a [self-confident] fool. 













###### 11 






An evil man seeks only rebellion; therefore a stern and pitiless messenger shall be sent against him. 













###### 12 






Let [the brute ferocity of] a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man rather than a [self-confident] fool in his folly [when he is in a rage]. 













###### 13 






Whoever rewards evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house. 













###### 14 






The beginning of strife is as when water first trickles [from a crack in a dam]; therefore stop contention before it becomes worse and quarreling breaks out. 













###### 15 






He who justifies the wicked and he who condemns the righteous are both an abomination [exceedingly disgusting and hateful] to the Lord. 













###### 16 






Of what use is money in the hand of a [self-confident] fool to buy skillful and godly Wisdom--when he has no understanding or heart for it? 













###### 17 






A friend loves at all times, and is born, as is a brother, for adversity. 













###### 18 






A man void of good sense gives a pledge and becomes security for another in the presence of his neighbor. 













###### 19 






He who loves strife and is quarrelsome loves transgression and involves himself in guilt; he who raises high his gateway and is boastful and arrogant invites destruction. 













###### 20 






He who has a wayward and crooked mind finds no good, and he who has a willful and contrary tongue will fall into calamity. 













###### 21 






He who becomes the parent of a [self-confident] fool does it to his sorrow, and the father of [an empty-headed] fool has no joy [in him]. 













###### 22 






A happy heart is good medicine and a cheerful mind works healing, but a broken spirit dries up the bones. 













###### 23 






A wicked man receives a bribe out of the bosom (pocket) to pervert the ways of justice. 













###### 24 






A man of understanding sets skillful and godly Wisdom before his face, but the eyes of a [self-confident] fool are on the ends of the earth. 













###### 25 






A self-confident and foolish son is a grief to his father and bitterness to her who bore him. 













###### 26 






Also, to punish or fine the righteous is not good, nor to smite the noble for their uprightness. 













###### 27 






He who has knowledge spares his words, and a man of understanding has a cool spirit. 













###### 28 






Even a fool when he holds his peace is considered wise; when he closes his lips he is esteemed a man of understanding.

# Proverbs 18

***














###### 1 






He who willfully separates _and_ estranges himself [from God and man] seeks his own desire _and_ pretext to break out against all wise _and_ sound judgment. 













###### 2 






A [self-confident] fool has no delight in understanding but only in revealing his personal opinions _and_ himself. 













###### 3 






When the wicked comes in [to the depth of evil], he becomes a contemptuous despiser [of all that is pure and good], and with inner baseness comes outer shame _and_ reproach. 













###### 4 






The words of a [discreet and wise] man's mouth are like deep waters [plenteous and difficult to fathom], and the fountain of skillful _and_ godly Wisdom is like a gushing stream [sparkling, fresh, pure, and life-giving]. 













###### 5 






To respect the person of the wicked _and_ be partial to him, so as to deprive the [consistently] righteous of justice, is not good. 













###### 6 






A [self-confident] fool's lips bring contention, and his mouth invites a beating. 













###### 7 






A [self-confident] fool's mouth is his ruin, and his lips are a snare to himself. 













###### 8 






The words of a whisperer _or_ talebearer are as dainty morsels; they go down into the innermost parts of the body. 













###### 9 






He who is loose _and_ slack in his work is brother to him who is a destroyer _and_ [^a]_he who does not use his endeavors to heal himself is brother to him who commits suicide_. 













###### 10 






The name of the Lord is a strong tower; the [consistently] righteous man [upright and in right standing with God] runs into it and is safe, high [above evil] _and_ strong. 













###### 11 






The rich man's wealth is his strong city, and as a high protecting wall in his own imagination _and_ conceit. 













###### 12 






Haughtiness comes before disaster, but humility before honor. 













###### 13 






He who answers a matter before he hears the facts--it is folly and shame to him. 













###### 14 






The strong spirit of a man sustains him in bodily pain _or_ trouble, but a weak _and_ broken spirit who can raise up _or_ bear? 













###### 15 






The mind of the prudent is ever getting knowledge, and the ear of the wise is ever seeking (inquiring for and craving) knowledge. 













###### 16 






A man's gift makes room for him and brings him before great men. 













###### 17 






He who states his case first seems right, until his rival comes and cross-examines him. 













###### 18 






To cast lots puts an end to disputes and decides between powerful contenders. 













###### 19 






A brother offended is harder to be won over than a strong city, and [their] contentions separate them like the bars of a castle. 













###### 20 






A man's [moral] self shall be filled with the fruit of his mouth; and with the consequence of his words he must be satisfied [whether good or evil]. 













###### 21 






Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and they who indulge in it shall eat the fruit of it [for death or life]. 













###### 22 






He who finds a [true] wife finds a good thing and obtains favor from the Lord. 













###### 23 






The poor man uses entreaties, but the rich answers roughly. 













###### 24 






The man of many friends [a friend of all the world] will prove himself a bad friend, but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.

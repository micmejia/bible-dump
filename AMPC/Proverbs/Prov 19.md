# Proverbs 19

***














###### 1 






Better is a poor man who walks in his integrity than a rich man who is perverse in his speech and is a [self-confident] fool. 













###### 2 






Desire without knowledge is not good, and to be overhasty is to sin _and_ miss the mark. 













###### 3 






The foolishness of man subverts his way [ruins his affairs]; then his heart is resentful _and_ frets against the Lord. 













###### 4 






Wealth makes many friends, but the poor man is avoided by his neighbor. 













###### 5 






A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he who breathes out lies shall not escape. 













###### 6 






Many will entreat the favor of a liberal man, and every man is a friend to him who gives gifts. 













###### 7 






All the brothers of a poor man detest him--how much more do his friends go far from him! He pursues them with words, but they are gone. 













###### 8 






He who gains Wisdom loves his own life; he who keeps understanding shall prosper _and_ find good. 













###### 9 






A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he who breathes forth lies shall perish. 













###### 10 






Luxury is not fitting for a [self-confident] fool--much less for a slave to rule over princes. 













###### 11 






Good sense makes a man restrain his anger, and it is his glory to overlook a transgression _or_ an offense. 













###### 12 






The king's wrath is as terrifying as the roaring of a lion, but his favor is as [refreshing as] dew upon the grass. 













###### 13 






A self-confident _and_ foolish son is the [multiplied] calamity of his father, and the contentions of a wife are like a continual dripping [of water through a chink in the roof]. 













###### 14 






House and riches are the inheritance from fathers, but a wise, understanding, _and_ prudent wife is from the Lord. 













###### 15 






Slothfulness casts one into a deep sleep, and the idle person shall suffer hunger. 













###### 16 






He who keeps the commandment [of the Lord] keeps his own life, but he who despises His ways shall die. 













###### 17 






He who has pity on the poor lends to the Lord, and that which he has given He will repay to him. 













###### 18 






Discipline your son while there is hope, but do not [indulge your angry resentments by undue chastisements and] set yourself to his ruin. 













###### 19 






A man of great wrath shall suffer the penalty; for if you deliver him [from the consequences], he will [feel free to] cause you to do it again. 













###### 20 






Hear counsel, receive instruction, _and_ accept correction, that you may be wise in the time to come. 













###### 21 






Many plans are in a man's mind, but it is the Lord's purpose for him that will stand. 













###### 22 






That which is desired in a man is loyalty _and_ kindness [and his glory and delight are his giving], but a poor man is better than a liar. 













###### 23 






The reverent, worshipful fear of the Lord leads to life, and he who has it rests satisfied; he cannot be visited with [actual] evil. 













###### 24 






The sluggard buries his hand in the dish, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again. 













###### 25 






Strike a scoffer, and the simple will learn prudence; reprove a man of understanding, and he will increase in knowledge. 













###### 26 






He who does violence to his father and chases away his mother is a son who causes shame and brings reproach. 













###### 27 






Cease, my son, to hear instruction only to ignore it _and_ stray from the words of knowledge. 













###### 28 






A worthless witness scoffs at justice, and the mouth of the wicked swallows iniquity. 













###### 29 






Judgments are prepared for scoffers, and stripes for the backs of [self-confident] fools.

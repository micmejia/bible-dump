# Proverbs 23

***














###### 1 






When you sit down to eat with a ruler, consider who _and_ what are before you; 













###### 2 






For you will put a knife to your throat if you are a man given to desire. 













###### 3 






Be not desirous of his dainties, for it is deceitful food [offered with questionable motives]. 













###### 4 






Weary not yourself to be rich; cease from your own [human] wisdom. 













###### 5 






Will you set your eyes upon wealth, when [suddenly] it is gone? For riches certainly make themselves wings, like an eagle that flies toward the heavens. 













###### 6 






Eat not the bread of him who has a hard, grudging, _and_ envious eye, neither desire his dainty foods; 













###### 7 






For as he thinks in his heart, so is he. As one who reckons, he says to you, eat and drink, yet his heart is not with you [but is grudging the cost]. 













###### 8 






The morsel which you have eaten you will vomit up, and your complimentary words will be wasted. 













###### 9 






Speak not in the ears of a [self-confident] fool, for he will despise the [godly] Wisdom of your words. 













###### 10 






Remove not the ancient landmark and enter not into the fields of the fatherless, 













###### 11 






For their Redeemer is mighty; He will plead their cause against you. 













###### 12 






Apply your mind to instruction _and_ correction and your ears to words of knowledge. 













###### 13 






Withhold not discipline from the child; for if you strike _and_ punish him with the [reedlike] rod, he will not die. 













###### 14 






You shall whip him with the rod and deliver his life from Sheol (Hades, the place of the dead). 













###### 15 






My son, if your heart is wise, my heart will be glad, even mine; 













###### 16 






Yes, my heart will rejoice when your lips speak right things. 













###### 17 






Let not your heart envy sinners, but continue in the reverent _and_ worshipful fear of the Lord all the day long. 













###### 18 






For surely there is a latter end [a future and a reward], and your hope _and_ expectation shall not be cut off. 













###### 19 






Hear, my son, and be wise, and direct your mind in the way [of the Lord]. 













###### 20 






Do not associate with winebibbers; be not among them _nor_ among gluttonous eaters of meat, 













###### 21 






For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty, and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags. 













###### 22 






Hearken to your father, who begot you, and despise not your mother when she is old. 













###### 23 






Buy the truth and sell it not; not only that, but also get discernment _and_ judgment, instruction and understanding. 













###### 24 






The father of the [uncompromisingly] righteous (the upright, in right standing with God) shall greatly rejoice, and he who becomes the father of a wise child shall have joy in him. 













###### 25 






Let your father and your mother be glad, and let her who bore you rejoice. 













###### 26 






My son, give me your heart and let your eyes observe _and_ delight in my ways, 













###### 27 






For a harlot is a deep ditch, and a loose woman is a narrow pit. 













###### 28 






She also lies in wait as a robber _or_ as one waits for prey, and she increases the treacherous among men. 













###### 29 






Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has strife? Who has complaining? Who has wounds without cause? Who has redness _and_ dimness of eyes? 













###### 30 






Those who tarry long at the wine, those who go to seek _and_ try mixed wine. 













###### 31 






Do not look at wine when it is red, when it sparkles in the wineglass, when it goes down smoothly. 













###### 32 






At the last it bites like a serpent and stings like an adder. 













###### 33 






[Under the influence of wine] your eyes will behold strange things [and loose women] and your mind will utter things turned the wrong way [untrue, incorrect, and petulant]. 













###### 34 






Yes, you will be [as unsteady] as he who lies down in the midst of the sea, and [as open to disaster] as he who lies upon the top of a mast. 













###### 35 






You will say, They struck me, but I was not hurt! They beat me [as with a hammer], but I did not feel it! When shall I awake? I will crave _and_ seek more wine again [and escape reality].

# Proverbs 24

***














###### 1 






Be not envious of evil men, nor desire to be with them; 













###### 2 






For their minds plot oppression _and_ devise violence, and their lips talk of causing trouble _and_ vexation. 













###### 3 






Through skillful _and_ godly Wisdom is a house (a life, a home, a family) built, and by understanding it is established [on a sound and good foundation], 













###### 4 






And by knowledge shall its chambers [of every area] be filled with all precious and pleasant riches. 













###### 5 






A wise man is strong _and_ [^a]_is better than a strong man_, and a man of knowledge increases _and_ strengthens his power; 













###### 6 






For by wise counsel you can wage your war, and in an abundance of counselors there is victory _and_ safety. 













###### 7 






Wisdom is too high for a [^b]fool; he opens not his mouth in the gate [where the city's rulers sit in judgment]. 













###### 8 






He who plans to do evil will be called a mischief-maker. 













###### 9 






The plans of the foolish _and_ the thought of foolishness are sin, and the scoffer is an abomination to men. 













###### 10 






If you faint in the day of adversity, your strength is small. 













###### 11 






Deliver those who are drawn away to death, and those who totter to the slaughter, hold them back [from their doom]. 













###### 12 






If you [profess ignorance and] say, Behold, we did not know this, does not He Who weighs _and_ ponders the heart perceive _and_ consider it? And He Who guards your life, does not He know it? And shall not He render to [you and] every man according to his works? 













###### 13 






My son, eat honey, because it is good, and the drippings of the honeycomb are sweet to your taste. 













###### 14 






So shall you know skillful _and_ godly Wisdom to be thus to your life; if you find it, then shall there be a future _and_ a reward, and your hope _and_ expectation shall not be cut off. 













###### 15 






Lie not in wait as a wicked man against the dwelling of the [uncompromisingly] righteous (the upright, in right standing with God); destroy not his resting-place; 













###### 16 






For a righteous man falls seven times and rises again, but the wicked are overthrown by calamity. 













###### 17 






Rejoice not when your enemy falls, and let not your heart be glad when he stumbles _or_ is overthrown, 













###### 18 






Lest the Lord see it and it be evil in His eyes _and_ displease Him, and He turn away His wrath from him [to expend it upon you, the worse offender]. 













###### 19 






Fret not because of evildoers, neither be envious of the wicked, 













###### 20 






For there shall be no reward for the evil man; the lamp of the wicked shall be put out. 













###### 21 






My son, [reverently] fear the Lord and the king, and do not associate with those who are given to change [of allegiance, and are revolutionary], 













###### 22 






For their calamity shall rise suddenly, and who knows the punishment _and_ ruin which both [the Lord and the king] will bring upon [the rebellious]? 













###### 23 






These also are sayings of the wise: To discriminate _and_ show partiality, having respect of persons in judging, is not good. 













###### 24 






He who says to the wicked, You are righteous _and_ innocent--peoples will curse him, nations will defy _and_ abhor him. 













###### 25 






But to those [upright judges] who rebuke the wicked, it will go well with them _and_ they will find delight, and a good blessing will be upon them. 













###### 26 






He kisses the lips [and wins the hearts of men] who give a right answer. 













###### 27 






[Put first things first.] Prepare your work outside and get it ready for yourself in the field; and afterward build your house _and_ establish a home. 













###### 28 






Be not a witness against your neighbor without cause, and deceive not with your lips. 













###### 29 






Say not, I will do to him as he has done to me; I will pay the man back for his deed. 













###### 30 






I went by the field of the lazy man, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding; 













###### 31 






And, behold, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles were covering its face, and its stone wall was broken down. 













###### 32 






Then I beheld _and_ considered it well; I looked _and_ received instruction. 













###### 33 






Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep-- 













###### 34 






So shall your poverty come as a robber, and your want as an armed man.

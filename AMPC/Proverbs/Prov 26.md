# Proverbs 26

***














###### 1 






Like snow in summer and like rain in harvest, so honor is not fitting for a [self-confident] fool. 













###### 2 






Like the sparrow in her wandering, like the swallow in her flying, so the causeless curse does not alight. 













###### 3 






A whip for the horse, a bridle for the donkey, and a [straight, slender] rod for the backs of [self-confident] fools. 













###### 4 






Answer not a [self-confident] fool according to his folly, lest you also be like him. 













###### 5 






Answer a [self-confident] fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own eyes _and_ conceit. 













###### 6 






He who sends a message by the hand of a [^a]fool cuts off the feet [of satisfactory delivery] and drinks the damage. 













###### 7 






Like the legs of a lame man which hang loose, so is a parable in the mouth of a fool. 













###### 8 






Like he who binds a stone in a sling, so is he who gives honor to a [self-confident] fool. 













###### 9 






Like a thorn that goes [without being felt] into the hand of a drunken man, so is a proverb in the mouth of a [self-confident] fool. 













###### 10 






[But] like an archer who wounds all, so is he who hires a fool or chance passers-by. 













###### 11 






As a dog returns to his vomit, so a fool returns to his folly. 













###### 12 






Do you see a man wise in his own eyes _and_ conceit? There is more hope for a [self-confident] fool than for him. 













###### 13 






The sluggard says, There is a lion in the way! A lion is in the streets! 













###### 14 






As the door turns on its hinges, so does the lazy man [move not from his place] upon his bed. 













###### 15 






The slothful _and_ self-indulgent buries his hand in his bosom; it distresses _and_ wearies him to bring it again to his mouth. 













###### 16 






The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes _and_ conceit than seven men who can render a reason _and_ answer discreetly. 













###### 17 






He who, passing by, stops to meddle with strife that is none of his business is like one who takes a dog by the ears. 













###### 18 






Like a madman who casts firebrands, arrows, and death, 













###### 19 






So is the man who deceives his neighbor and then says, Was I not joking? 













###### 20 






For lack of wood the fire goes out, and where there is no whisperer, contention ceases. 













###### 21 






As coals are to hot embers and as wood to fire, so is a quarrelsome man to inflame strife. 













###### 22 






The words of a whisperer _or_ slanderer are like dainty morsels _or_ words of sport [to some, but to others are like deadly wounds]; and they go down into the innermost parts of the body [or of the victim's nature]. 













###### 23 






Burning lips [uttering insincere words of love] and a wicked heart are like an earthen vessel covered with the scum thrown off from molten silver [making it appear to be solid silver]. 













###### 24 






He who hates pretends with his lips, but stores up deceit within himself. 













###### 25 






When he speaks kindly, do not trust him, for seven abominations are in his heart. 













###### 26 






Though his hatred covers itself with guile, his wickedness shall be shown openly before the assembly. 













###### 27 






Whoever digs a pit [for another man's feet] shall fall into it himself, and he who rolls a stone [up a height to do mischief], it will return upon him. 













###### 28 






A lying tongue hates those it wounds _and_ crushes, and a flattering mouth works ruin.

# Proverbs 28

***














###### 1 






The wicked flee when no man pursues them, but the [uncompromisingly] righteous are bold as a lion. 













###### 2 






When a land transgresses, it has many rulers, but when the ruler is a man of discernment, understanding, _and_ knowledge, its stability will long continue. 













###### 3 






A poor man who oppresses the poor is like a sweeping rain which leaves no food [plundering them of their last morsels]. 













###### 4 






Those who forsake the law [of God and man] praise the wicked, but those who keep the law [of God and man] contend with them. 













###### 5 






Evil men do not understand justice, but they who crave _and_ seek the Lord understand it fully. 













###### 6 






Better is the poor man who walks in his integrity than he who willfully goes in double _and_ wrong ways, though he is rich. 













###### 7 






Whoever keeps the law [of God and man] is a wise son, but he who is a companion of gluttons _and_ the carousing, self-indulgent, _and_ extravagant shames his father. 













###### 8 






He who by charging excessive interest _and_ who by unjust efforts to get gain increases his material possession gathers it for him [to spend] who is kind _and_ generous to the poor. 













###### 9 






He who turns away his ear from hearing the law [of God and man], even his prayer is an abomination, hateful _and_ revolting [to God]. 













###### 10 






Whoever leads the upright astray into an evil way, he will himself fall into his own pit, but the blameless will have a goodly inheritance. 













###### 11 






The rich man is wise in his own eyes _and_ conceit, but the poor man who has understanding will find him out. 













###### 12 






When the [uncompromisingly] righteous triumph, there is great glory _and_ celebration; but when the wicked rise [to power], men hide themselves. 













###### 13 






He who covers his transgressions will not prosper, but whoever confesses and forsakes his sins will obtain mercy. 













###### 14 






Blessed (happy, fortunate, and to be envied) is the man who reverently _and_ worshipfully fears [the Lord] at all times [regardless of circumstances], but he who hardens his heart will fall into calamity. 













###### 15 






Like a roaring lion or a ravenous _and_ charging bear is a wicked ruler over a poor people. 













###### 16 






A ruler who lacks understanding is [like a wicked one] a great oppressor, but he who hates covetousness _and_ unjust gain shall prolong his days. 













###### 17 






If a man willfully sheds the blood of a person [and keeps the guilt of murder upon his conscience], he is fleeing to the pit (the grave) _and_ hastening to his own destruction; let no man stop him! 













###### 18 






He who walks uprightly shall be safe, but he who willfully goes in double _and_ wrong ways shall fall in one of them. 













###### 19 






He who cultivates his land will have plenty of bread, but he who follows worthless people _and_ pursuits will have poverty enough. 













###### 20 






A faithful man shall abound with blessings, but he who makes haste to be rich [at any cost] shall not go unpunished. 













###### 21 






To have respect of persons _and_ to show partiality is not good, neither is it good that man should transgress for a piece of bread. 













###### 22 






He who has an evil _and_ covetous eye hastens to be rich and knows not that want will come upon him. 













###### 23 






He who rebukes a man shall afterward find more favor than he who flatters with the tongue. 













###### 24 






Whoever robs his father or his mother and says, This is no sin--he is in the same class as [an open, lawless robber and] a destroyer. 













###### 25 






He who is of a greedy spirit stirs up strife, but he who puts his trust in the Lord shall be enriched _and_ blessed. 













###### 26 






He who leans on, trusts in, _and_ is confident of his own mind _and_ heart is a [self-confident] fool, but he who walks in skillful _and_ godly Wisdom shall be delivered. 













###### 27 






He who gives to the poor will not want, but he who hides his eyes [from their want] will have many a curse. 













###### 28 






When the wicked rise [to power], men hide themselves; but when they perish, the [consistently] righteous increase _and_ become many.

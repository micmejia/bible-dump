# Proverbs 31

***














###### 1 






The words of Lemuel king of Massa, which his mother taught him: 













###### 2 






What, my son? What, son of my womb? What [shall I advise you], son of my vows _and_ dedication to God? 













###### 3 






Give not your strength to [loose] women, nor your ways to those who _and_ that which ruin _and_ destroy kings. 













###### 4 






It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine, or for rulers to desire strong drink, 













###### 5 






Lest they drink and forget the law _and_ what it decrees, and pervert the justice due any of the afflicted. 













###### 6 






Give strong drink [as medicine] to him who is ready to pass away, and wine to him in bitter distress of heart. 













###### 7 






Let him drink and forget his poverty and [seriously] remember his want _and_ misery no more. 













###### 8 






Open your mouth for the dumb [those unable to speak for themselves], for the rights of all who are left desolate _and_ defenseless; 













###### 9 






Open your mouth, judge righteously, and administer justice for the poor and needy. 













###### 10 






A capable, intelligent, _and_ virtuous woman--who is he who can find her? She is far more precious than jewels _and_ her value is far above rubies _or_ pearls. 













###### 11 






The heart of her husband trusts in her confidently _and_ relies on and believes in her securely, so that he has no lack of [honest] gain or need of [dishonest] spoil. 













###### 12 






She comforts, encourages, _and_ does him only good as long as there is life within her. 













###### 13 






She seeks out wool and flax and works with willing hands [to develop it]. 













###### 14 






She is like the merchant ships loaded with foodstuffs; she brings her household's food from a far [country]. 













###### 15 






She rises while it is yet night and gets [spiritual] food for her household and assigns her maids their tasks. 













###### 16 






She considers a [new] field before she buys _or_ accepts it [expanding prudently and not courting neglect of her present duties by assuming other duties]; with her savings [of time and strength] she plants fruitful vines in her vineyard. 













###### 17 






She girds herself with strength [spiritual, mental, and physical fitness for her God-given task] and makes her arms strong _and_ firm. 













###### 18 






She tastes _and_ sees that her gain from work [with and for God] is good; her lamp goes not out, but it burns on continually through the night [of trouble, privation, or sorrow, warning away fear, doubt, and distrust]. 













###### 19 






She lays her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff. 













###### 20 






She opens her hand to the poor, yes, she reaches out her filled hands to the needy [whether in body, mind, or spirit]. 













###### 21 






She fears not the snow for her family, for all her household are doubly clothed in scarlet. 













###### 22 






She makes for herself coverlets, cushions, _and_ rugs of tapestry. Her clothing is of linen, pure _and_ fine, and of purple [such as that of which the clothing of the priests and the hallowed cloths of the temple were made]. 













###### 23 






Her husband is known in the [city's] gates, when he sits among the elders of the land. 













###### 24 






She makes fine linen garments _and_ leads others to buy them; she delivers to the merchants girdles [or sashes that free one up for service]. 













###### 25 






Strength and dignity are her clothing _and_ her position is strong and secure; she rejoices over the future [the latter day or time to come, knowing that she and her family are in readiness for it]! 













###### 26 






She opens her mouth in skillful and godly Wisdom, and on her tongue is the law of kindness [giving counsel and instruction]. 













###### 27 






She looks well to how things go in her household, and the bread of idleness (gossip, discontent, and self-pity) she will not eat. 













###### 28 






Her children rise up and call her blessed (happy, fortunate, and to be envied); and her husband boasts of _and_ praises her, [saying], 













###### 29 






Many daughters have done virtuously, nobly, _and_ well [with the strength of character that is steadfast in goodness], but you excel them all. 













###### 30 






Charm _and_ grace are deceptive, and beauty is vain [because it is not lasting], but a woman who reverently _and_ worshipfully fears the Lord, she shall be praised! 













###### 31 






Give her of the fruit of her hands, and let her own works praise her in the gates [of the city]!

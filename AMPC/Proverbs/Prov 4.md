# Proverbs 4

***














###### 1 






Hear, my sons, the instruction of a father, and pay attention in order to gain _and_ to know intelligent discernment, comprehension, _and_ interpretation [of spiritual matters]. 













###### 2 






For I give you good doctrine [what is to be received]; do not forsake my teaching. 













###### 3 






When I [Solomon] was a son with my father [David], tender and the only son in the sight of my mother [Bathsheba], 













###### 4 






He taught me and said to me, Let your heart hold fast my words; keep my commandments and live. 













###### 5 






Get skillful _and_ godly Wisdom, get understanding (discernment, comprehension, and interpretation); do not forget and do not turn back from the words of my mouth. 













###### 6 






Forsake not [Wisdom], and she will keep, defend, _and_ protect you; love her, and she will guard you. 













###### 7 






The beginning of Wisdom is: get Wisdom (skillful and godly Wisdom)! [For skillful _and_ godly Wisdom is the principal thing.] And with all you have gotten, get understanding (discernment, comprehension, and interpretation). 













###### 8 






Prize Wisdom highly _and_ exalt her, and she will exalt _and_ promote you; she will bring you to honor when you embrace her. 













###### 9 






She shall give to your head a wreath of gracefulness; a crown of beauty _and_ glory will she deliver to you. 













###### 10 






Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings, and the years of your life shall be many. 













###### 11 






I have taught you in the way of skillful _and_ godly Wisdom [which is comprehensive insight into the ways and purposes of God]; I have led you in paths of uprightness. 













###### 12 






When you walk, your steps shall not be hampered [your path will be clear and open]; and when you run, you shall not stumble. 













###### 13 






Take firm hold of instruction, do not let go; guard her, for she is your life. 













###### 14 






Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men. 













###### 15 






Avoid it, do not go on it; turn from it and pass on. 













###### 16 






For they cannot sleep unless they have caused trouble _or_ vexation; their sleep is taken away unless they have caused someone to fall. 













###### 17 






For they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence. 













###### 18 






But the path of the [uncompromisingly] just _and_ righteous is like the light of dawn, that shines more and more (brighter and clearer) until [it reaches its full strength and glory in] the perfect day [to be prepared]. 













###### 19 






The way of the wicked is like deep darkness; they do not know over what they stumble. 













###### 20 






My son, attend to my words; consent _and_ submit to my sayings. 













###### 21 






Let them not depart from your sight; keep them in the center of your heart. 













###### 22 






For they are life to those who find them, healing _and_ health to all their flesh. 













###### 23 






Keep _and_ guard your heart with all vigilance _and_ above all that you guard, for out of it flow the springs of life. 













###### 24 






Put away from you false _and_ dishonest speech, and willful _and_ contrary talk put far from you. 













###### 25 






Let your eyes look right on [with fixed purpose], and let your gaze be straight before you. 













###### 26 






Consider well the path of your feet, and let all your ways be established _and_ ordered aright. 













###### 27 






Turn not aside to the right hand or to the left; remove your foot from evil. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Proverbs 6

***














###### 1 






My son, if you have become security for your neighbor, if you have given your pledge for a stranger _or_ another, 













###### 2 






You are snared with the words of your lips, you are caught by the speech of your mouth. 













###### 3 






Do this now [at once and earnestly], my son, and deliver yourself when you have put yourself into the [^a]power of your neighbor; go, bestir _and_ humble yourself, and beg your neighbor [to pay his debt and thereby release you]. 













###### 4 






Give not [unnecessary] sleep to your eyes, nor slumber to your eyelids; 













###### 5 






Deliver yourself, as a roe _or_ gazelle from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler. 













###### 6 






Go to the ant, you sluggard; consider her ways and be wise!-- 













###### 7 






Which, having no chief, overseer, or ruler, 













###### 8 






Provides her food in the summer and gathers her supplies in the harvest. 













###### 9 






How long will you sleep, O sluggard? When will you arise out of your sleep? 













###### 10 






Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to lie down _and_ sleep-- 













###### 11 






So will your poverty come like a robber _or_ one who travels [with slowly but surely approaching steps] and your want like an armed man [making you helpless]. 













###### 12 






A worthless person, a wicked man, is he who goes about with a perverse (contrary, wayward) mouth. 













###### 13 






He winks with his eyes, he speaks by shuffling _or_ tapping with his feet, he makes signs [to mislead and deceive] _and_ teaches with his fingers. 













###### 14 






Willful _and_ contrary in his heart, he devises trouble, vexation, _and_ evil continually; he lets loose discord _and_ sows it. 













###### 15 






Therefore upon him shall the crushing weight of calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken, and that without remedy. 













###### 16 






These six things the Lord hates, indeed, seven are an abomination to Him: 













###### 17 






A proud look [the spirit that makes one overestimate himself and underestimate others], a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, 













###### 18 






A heart that manufactures wicked thoughts _and_ plans, feet that are swift in running to evil, 













###### 19 






A false witness who breathes out lies [even under oath], and he who sows discord among his brethren. 













###### 20 






My son, keep your father's [God-given] commandment and forsake not the law of [God] your mother [taught you]. 













###### 21 






Bind them continually upon your heart and tie them about your neck. 













###### 22 






When you go, they [the words of your parents' God] shall lead you; when you sleep, they shall keep you; and when you waken, they shall talk with you. 













###### 23 






For the commandment is a lamp, and the whole teaching [of the law] is light, and reproofs of discipline are the way of life, 













###### 24 






To keep you from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a loose woman. 













###### 25 






Lust not after her beauty in your heart, neither let her capture you with her eyelids. 













###### 26 






For on account of a harlot a man is brought to a piece of bread, and the adulteress stalks _and_ snares [as with a hook] the precious life [of a man]. 













###### 27 






Can a man take fire in his bosom and his clothes not be burned? 













###### 28 






Can one go upon hot coals and his feet not be burned? 













###### 29 






So he who cohabits with his neighbor's wife [will be tortured with evil consequences and just retribution]; he who touches her shall not be innocent _or_ go unpunished. 













###### 30 






Men do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy himself when he is hungry; 













###### 31 






But if he is found out, he must restore seven times [what he stole]; he must give the whole substance of his house [if necessary--to meet his fine]. 













###### 32 






But whoever commits adultery with a woman lacks heart _and_ understanding (moral principle and prudence); he who does it is destroying his own life. 













###### 33 






Wounds and disgrace will he get, and his reproach will not be wiped away. 













###### 34 






For jealousy makes [the wronged] man furious; therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance [upon the detected one]. 













###### 35 






He will not consider any ransom [offered to buy him off from demanding full punishment]; neither will he be satisfied, though you offer him many gifts _and_ bribes.

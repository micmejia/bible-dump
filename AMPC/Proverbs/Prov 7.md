# Proverbs 7

***














###### 1 






My son, keep my words; lay up within you my commandments [for use when needed] _and_ treasure them. 













###### 2 






Keep my commandments and live, and keep my law _and_ teaching as the apple (the pupil) of your eye. 













###### 3 






Bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart. 













###### 4 






Say to skillful _and_ godly Wisdom, You are my sister, and regard understanding _or_ insight as your intimate friend-- 













###### 5 






That they may keep you from the loose woman, from the adventuress who flatters with _and_ makes smooth her words. 













###### 6 






For at the window of my house I looked out through my lattice. 













###### 7 






And among the simple (empty-headed and emptyhearted) ones, I perceived among the youths a young man void of good sense, 













###### 8 






Sauntering through the street near the [loose woman's] corner; and he went the way to her house 













###### 9 






In the twilight, in the evening; night black and dense was falling [over the young man's life]. 













###### 10 






And behold, there met him a woman, dressed as a harlot and sly _and_ cunning of heart. 













###### 11 






She is turbulent _and_ willful; her feet stay not in her house; 













###### 12 






Now in the streets, now in the marketplaces, she sets her ambush at every corner. 













###### 13 






So she caught him and kissed him and with impudent face she said to him, 













###### 14 






Sacrifices of peace offerings were due from me; this day I paid my vows. 













###### 15 






So I came forth to meet you [that you might share with me the feast from my offering]; diligently I sought your face, and I have found you. 













###### 16 






I have spread my couch with rugs _and_ cushions of tapestry, with striped sheets of fine linen of Egypt. 













###### 17 






I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 













###### 18 






Come, let us take our fill of love until morning; let us console _and_ delight ourselves with love. 













###### 19 






For the man is not at home; he is gone on a long journey; 













###### 20 






He has taken a bag of money with him and will come home at the day appointed [at the full moon]. 













###### 21 






With much justifying _and_ enticing argument she persuades him, with the allurements of her lips she leads him [to overcome his conscience and his fears] _and_ forces him along. 













###### 22 






Suddenly he [yields and] follows her reluctantly like an ox moving to the slaughter, like one in fetters going to the correction [to be given] to a fool _or_ [^a]_like a dog enticed by food to the muzzle_ 













###### 23 






Till a dart [of passion] pierces _and_ inflames his vitals; then like a bird fluttering straight into the net [he hastens], not knowing that it will cost him his life. 













###### 24 






Listen to me now therefore, O you sons, and be attentive to the words of my mouth. 













###### 25 






Let not your heart incline toward her ways, do not stray into her paths. 













###### 26 






For she has cast down many wounded; indeed, all her slain are a mighty host. 













###### 27 






Her house is the way to Sheol (Hades, the place of the dead), going down to the chambers of death.

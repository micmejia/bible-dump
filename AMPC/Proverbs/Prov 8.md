# Proverbs 8

***














###### 1 






Does not skillful _and_ godly Wisdom cry out, and understanding raise her voice [in contrast to the loose woman]? 













###### 2 






On the top of the heights beside the way, where the paths meet, stands Wisdom [skillful and godly]; 













###### 3 






At the gates at the entrance of the town, at the coming in at the doors, she cries out: 













###### 4 






To you, O men, I call, and my voice is directed to the sons of men. 













###### 5 






O you simple _and_ thoughtless ones, understand prudence; you [self-confident] fools, be of an understanding heart. 













###### 6 






Hear, for I will speak excellent _and_ princely things; and the opening of my lips shall be for right things. 













###### 7 






For my mouth shall utter truth, and wrongdoing is detestable _and_ loathsome to my lips. 













###### 8 






All the words of my mouth are righteous (upright and in right standing with God); there is nothing contrary to truth or crooked in them. 













###### 9 






They are all plain to him who understands [and opens his heart], and right to those who find knowledge [and live by it]. 













###### 10 






Receive my instruction in preference to [striving for] silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold, 













###### 11 






For skillful _and_ godly Wisdom is better than rubies _or_ pearls, and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it. 













###### 12 






I, Wisdom [from God], make prudence my dwelling, and I find out knowledge and discretion. 













###### 13 






The reverent fear _and_ worshipful awe of the Lord [includes] the hatred of evil; pride, arrogance, the evil way, and perverted _and_ twisted speech I hate. 













###### 14 






I have counsel and sound knowledge, I have understanding, I have might _and_ power. 













###### 15 






By me kings reign and rulers decree justice. 













###### 16 






By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges _and_ governors of the earth. 













###### 17 






I love those who love me, and those who seek me early _and_ diligently shall find me. 













###### 18 






Riches and honor are with me, enduring wealth and righteousness (uprightness in every area and relation, and right standing with God). 













###### 19 






My fruit is better than gold, yes, than refined gold, and my increase than choice silver. 













###### 20 






I [Wisdom] walk in the way of righteousness (moral and spiritual rectitude in every area and relation), in the midst of the paths of justice, 













###### 21 






That I may cause those who love me to inherit [true] riches and that I may fill their treasuries. 













###### 22 






The Lord formed _and_ brought me [Wisdom] forth at the beginning of His way, before His acts of old. 













###### 23 






I [Wisdom] was inaugurated _and_ ordained from everlasting, from the beginning, before ever the earth existed. 













###### 24 






When there were no deeps, I was brought forth, when there were no fountains laden with water. 













###### 25 






Before the mountains were settled, before the hills, I was brought forth, 













###### 26 






While as yet He had not made the land or the fields or the first of the dust of the earth. 













###### 27 






When He prepared the heavens, I [Wisdom] was there; when He drew a circle upon the face of the deep _and_ stretched out the firmament over it, 













###### 28 






When He made firm the skies above, when He established the fountains of the deep, 













###### 29 






When He gave to the sea its limit _and_ His decree that the waters should not transgress [across the boundaries set by] His command, when He appointed the foundations of the earth-- 













###### 30 






Then I [Wisdom] was [^a]beside Him as a master _and_ director of the work; and I was daily His delight, rejoicing before Him always, 













###### 31 






Rejoicing in His inhabited earth and delighting in the sons of men. 













###### 32 






Now therefore listen to me, O you sons; for blessed (happy, fortunate, to be envied) are those who keep my ways. 













###### 33 






Hear instruction and be wise, and do not refuse _or_ neglect it. 













###### 34 






Blessed (happy, fortunate, to be envied) is the man who listens to me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors. 













###### 35 






For whoever finds me [Wisdom] finds life and draws forth _and_ obtains favor from the Lord. 













###### 36 






But he who misses me _or_ sins against me wrongs _and_ injures himself; all who hate me love _and_ court death.

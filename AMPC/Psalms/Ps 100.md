# Psalms 100

***


###### 1 


Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all you lands! 


###### 2 


Serve the Lord with gladness! Come before His presence with singing! 


###### 3 


Know (perceive, recognize, and understand with approval) that the Lord is God! It is He Who has made us, not we ourselves [and we are His]! We are His people and the sheep of His pasture. 


###### 4 


Enter into His gates with thanksgiving and a thank offering and into His courts with praise! Be thankful and say so to Him, bless and affectionately praise His name! 


###### 5 


For the Lord is good; His mercy and loving-kindness are everlasting, His faithfulness and truth endure to all generations.

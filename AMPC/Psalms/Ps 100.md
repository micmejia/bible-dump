# Psalms 100

***














###### 1 






Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all you lands! 













###### 2 






Serve the Lord with gladness! Come before His presence with singing! 













###### 3 






Know (perceive, recognize, and understand with approval) that the Lord is God! It is He Who has made us, not we ourselves [and we are His]! We are His people and the sheep of His pasture. 













###### 4 






Enter into His gates with thanksgiving _and_ a thank offering and into His courts with praise! Be thankful _and_ say so to Him, bless _and_ affectionately praise His name! 













###### 5 






For the Lord is good; His mercy _and_ loving-kindness are everlasting, His faithfulness _and_ truth endure to all generations. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Psalms 101

***














###### 1 






I will sing of mercy _and_ loving-kindness and justice; to You, O Lord, will I sing. 













###### 2 






I will behave myself wisely _and_ give heed to the blameless way--O when will You come to me? I will walk within my house in integrity _and_ with a blameless heart. 













###### 3 






I will set no base _or_ wicked thing before my eyes. I hate the work of them who turn aside [from the right path]; it shall not grasp hold of me. 













###### 4 






A perverse heart shall depart from me; I will know no evil person _or_ thing. 













###### 5 






Whoso privily slanders his neighbor, him will I cut off [from me]; he who has a haughty look and a proud _and_ arrogant heart I cannot _and_ I will not tolerate. 













###### 6 






My eyes shall [look with favor] upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me; he who walks blamelessly, he shall minister to me. 













###### 7 






He who works deceit shall not dwell in my house; he who tells lies shall not continue in my presence. 













###### 8 






Morning after morning I will root up all the wicked in the land, that I may eliminate all the evildoers from the city of the Lord.

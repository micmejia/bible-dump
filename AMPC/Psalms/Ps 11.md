# Psalms 11

***














###### 1 






In the Lord I take refuge [and put my trust]; how can you say to me, Flee like a bird to your mountain? 













###### 2 






For see, the wicked are bending the bow; they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they [furtively] in darkness may shoot at the upright in heart. 













###### 3 






If the foundations are destroyed, what can the [unyieldingly] righteous do, _or_ what has He [the Righteous One] wrought _or_ accomplished? 













###### 4 






The Lord is in His holy temple; the Lord's throne is in heaven. His eyes behold; His eyelids test _and_ prove the children of men. 













###### 5 






The Lord tests _and_ proves the [unyieldingly] righteous, but His soul abhors the wicked and him who loves violence. 













###### 6 






Upon the wicked He will rain quick burning coals _or_ snares; fire, brimstone, and a [dreadful] scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup. 













###### 7 






For the Lord is [rigidly] righteous, He loves righteous deeds; the upright shall behold His face, _or_ He beholds the upright.

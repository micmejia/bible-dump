# Psalms 110

***














###### 1 






The Lord (God) says to my Lord (the Messiah), Sit at My right hand, until I make Your adversaries Your footstool. 













###### 2 






The Lord will send forth from Zion the scepter of Your strength; rule, then, in the midst of Your foes. 













###### 3 






Your people will offer themselves willingly in the day of Your power, in the beauty of holiness _and_ in holy array out of the womb of the morning; to You [will spring forth] Your young men, who are as the dew. 













###### 4 






The Lord has sworn and will not revoke _or_ change it: You are a priest forever, after the manner _and_ order of Melchizedek. 













###### 5 






The Lord at Your right hand will shatter kings in the day of His indignation. 













###### 6 






He will execute judgment [in overwhelming punishment] upon the nations; He will fill the valleys with the dead bodies, He will crush the [chief] heads over lands many _and_ far extended. 













###### 7 






He will drink of the brook by the way; therefore will He lift up His head [triumphantly].

# Psalms 111

***


###### 1 


Praise the Lord! (Hallelujah!) I will praise and give thanks to the Lord with my whole heart in the council of the upright and in the congregation. 


###### 2 


The works of the Lord are great, sought out by all those who have delight in them. 


###### 3 


His work is honorable and glorious, and His righteousness endures forever. 


###### 4 


He has made His wonderful works to be remembered; the Lord is gracious, merciful, and full of loving compassion. 


###### 5 


He has given food and provision to those who reverently and worshipfully fear Him; He will remember His covenant forever and imprint it [on His mind]. 


###### 6 


He has declared and shown to His people the power of His works in giving them the heritage of the nations [of Canaan]. 


###### 7 


The works of His hands are [absolute] truth and justice [faithful and right]; and all His decrees and precepts are sure (fixed, established, and trustworthy). 


###### 8 


They stand fast and are established forever and ever and are done in [absolute] truth and uprightness. 


###### 9 


He has sent redemption to His people; He has commanded His covenant to be forever; holy is His name, inspiring awe, reverence, and godly fear. 


###### 10 


The reverent fear and worship of the Lord is the beginning of Wisdom and skill [the preceding and the first essential, the prerequisite and the alphabet]; a good understanding, wisdom, and meaning have all those who do [the will of the Lord]. Their praise of Him endures forever.

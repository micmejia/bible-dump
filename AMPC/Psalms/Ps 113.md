# Psalms 113

***














###### 1 






Praise the Lord! (Hallelujah!) Praise, O servants of the Lord, praise the name of the Lord! 













###### 2 






Blessed be the name of the Lord from this time forth and forever 













###### 3 






From the rising of the sun to the going down of it _and_ from east to west, the name of the Lord is to be praised! 













###### 4 






The Lord is high above all nations, and His glory above the heavens! 













###### 5 






Who is like the Lord our God, Who has His seat on high, 













###### 6 






Who humbles Himself to regard the heavens and the earth! 













###### 7 






[The Lord] raises the poor out of the dust _and_ lifts the needy from the ash heap _and_ the dung hill, 













###### 8 






That He may seat them with princes, even with the princes of His people. 













###### 9 






He makes the barren woman to be a homemaker _and_ a joyful mother of [spiritual] children. Praise the Lord!

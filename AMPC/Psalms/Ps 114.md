# Psalms 114

***


###### 1 


When Israel came forth out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language, 


###### 2 


Judah became [God's] sanctuary (the Holy Place of His habitation), and Israel His dominion. 


###### 3 


The [Red] Sea looked and fled; the Jordan [River] was turned back. 


###### 4 


The mountains skipped like rams, the little hills like lambs. 


###### 5 


What ails you, O [Red] Sea, that you flee? O Jordan, that you turn back? 


###### 6 


You mountains, that you skip like rams, and you little hills, like lambs? 


###### 7 


Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob, 


###### 8 


Who turned the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a fountain of waters.

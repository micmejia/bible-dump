# Psalms 114

***














###### 1 






When Israel came forth out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language, 













###### 2 






Judah became [God's] sanctuary (the Holy Place of His habitation), and Israel His dominion. 













###### 3 






The [Red] Sea looked and fled; the Jordan [River] was turned back. 













###### 4 






The mountains skipped like rams, the little hills like lambs. 













###### 5 






What ails you, O [Red] Sea, that you flee? O Jordan, that you turn back? 













###### 6 






You mountains, that you skip like rams, and you little hills, like lambs? 













###### 7 






Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob, 













###### 8 






Who turned the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a fountain of waters. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

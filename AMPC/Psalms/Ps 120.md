# Psalms 120

***














###### 1 






In my distress I cried to the Lord, and He answered me. 













###### 2 






Deliver me, O Lord, from lying lips and from deceitful tongues. 













###### 3 






What shall be given to you? Or what more shall be done to you, you deceitful tongue?-- 













###### 4 






Sharp arrows of a [mighty] warrior, with [glowing] coals of the broom tree! 













###### 5 






Woe is me that I sojourn with Meshech, that I dwell beside the tents of Kedar [as if among notoriously barbarous people]! 













###### 6 






My life has too long had its dwelling with him who hates peace. 













###### 7 






I am for peace; but when I speak, they are for war.

# Psalms 123

***














###### 1 






Unto You do I lift up my eyes, O You Who are enthroned in heaven. 













###### 2 






Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master, and as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress, so our eyes look to the Lord our God, until He has mercy and loving-kindness for us. 













###### 3 






Have mercy on us, O Lord, have mercy on and loving-kindness for us, for we are exceedingly satiated with contempt. 













###### 4 






Our life is exceedingly filled with the scorning and scoffing of those who are at ease and with the contempt of the proud (irresponsible tyrants who disregard God's law).

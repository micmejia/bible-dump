# Psalms 124

***














###### 1 






If it had not been the Lord Who was on our side--now may Israel say-- 













###### 2 






If it had not been the Lord Who was on our side when men rose up against us, 













###### 3 






Then they would have quickly swallowed us up alive when their wrath was kindled against us; 













###### 4 






Then the waters would have overwhelmed us _and_ swept us away, the torrent would have gone over us; 













###### 5 






Then the proud waters would have gone over us. 













###### 6 






Blessed be the Lord, Who has not given us as prey to their teeth! 













###### 7 






We are like a bird escaped from the snare of the fowlers; the snare is broken, and we have escaped! 













###### 8

# Psalms 125

***














###### 1 






Those who trust in, lean on, _and_ confidently hope in the Lord are like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved but abides _and_ stands fast forever. 













###### 2 






As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about His people from this time forth and forever. 













###### 3 






For the scepter of wickedness shall not rest upon the land of the [uncompromisingly] righteous, lest the righteous (God's people) stretch forth their hands to iniquity _and_ apostasy. 













###### 4 






Do good, O Lord, to those who are good, and to those who are right [with You and all people] in their hearts. 













###### 5 






As for such as turn aside to their crooked ways [of indifference to God], the Lord will lead them forth with the workers of iniquity. Peace be upon Israel!

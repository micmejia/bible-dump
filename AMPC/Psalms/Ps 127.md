# Psalms 127

***














###### 1 






Except the Lord builds the house, they labor in vain who build it; except the Lord keeps the city, the watchman wakes but in vain. 













###### 2 






It is vain for you to rise up early, to take rest late, to eat the bread of [anxious] toil--for He gives [blessings] to His beloved in sleep. 













###### 3 






Behold, children are a heritage from the Lord, the fruit of the womb a reward. 













###### 4 






As arrows are in the hand of a warrior, so are the children of one's youth. 













###### 5 






Happy, blessed, _and_ fortunate is the man whose quiver is filled with them! They will not be put to shame when they speak with their adversaries [in gatherings] at the [city's] gate.

# Psalms 130

***














###### 1 






Out of the depths have I cried to You, O Lord. 













###### 2 






Lord, hear my voice; let Your ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications. 













###### 3 






If You, Lord, should keep account of _and_ treat [us according to our] sins, O Lord, who could stand? 













###### 4 






But there is forgiveness with You [just what man needs], that You may be reverently feared _and_ worshiped. 













###### 5 






I wait for the Lord, I expectantly wait, and in His word do I hope. 













###### 6 






I am looking _and_ waiting for the Lord more than watchmen for the morning, I say, more than watchmen for the morning. 













###### 7 






O Israel, hope in the Lord! For with the Lord there is mercy _and_ loving-kindness, and with Him is plenteous redemption. 













###### 8 






And He will redeem Israel from all their iniquities. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Psalms 131

***














###### 1 






Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor my eyes lofty; neither do I exercise myself in matters too great or in things too wonderful for me. 













###### 2 






Surely I have calmed and quieted my soul; like a weaned child with his mother, like a weaned child is my soul within me [ceased from fretting]. 













###### 3 






O Israel, hope in the Lord from this time forth and forever.

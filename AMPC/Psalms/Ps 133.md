# Psalms 133

***














###### 1 






Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity! 













###### 2 






It is like the precious ointment poured on the head, that ran down on the beard, even the beard of Aaron [the first high priest], that came down upon the collar _and_ skirts of his garments [consecrating the whole body]. 













###### 3 






It is like the dew of [lofty] Mount Hermon and the dew that comes on the hills of Zion; for there the Lord has commanded the blessing, even life forevermore [upon the high and the lowly].

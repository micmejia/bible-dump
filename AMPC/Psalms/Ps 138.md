# Psalms 138

***














###### 1 






I will confess _and_ praise You [O God] with my whole heart; before the gods will I sing praises to You. 













###### 2 






I will worship toward Your holy temple and praise Your name for Your loving-kindness and for Your truth _and_ faithfulness; for You have exalted above all else Your name and Your word _and_ You have magnified Your word above all Your name! 













###### 3 






In the day when I called, You answered me; and You strengthened me with strength (might and inflexibility to temptation) in my inner self. 













###### 4 






All the kings of the land shall give You credit _and_ praise You, O Lord, for they have heard of the promises of Your mouth [which were fulfilled]. 













###### 5 






Yes, they shall sing of the ways of the Lord _and_ joyfully celebrate His mighty acts, for great is the glory of the Lord. 













###### 6 






For though the Lord is high, yet has He respect to the lowly [bringing them into fellowship with Him]; but the proud _and_ haughty He knows _and_ recognizes [only] at a distance. 













###### 7 






Though I walk in the midst of trouble, You will revive me; You will stretch forth Your hand against the wrath of my enemies, and Your right hand will save me. 













###### 8 






The Lord will perfect that which concerns me; Your mercy _and_ loving-kindness, O Lord, endure forever--forsake not the works of Your own hands.

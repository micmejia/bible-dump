# Psalms 15

***














###### 1 






Lord, who shall dwell [temporarily] in Your tabernacle? Who shall dwell [permanently] on Your holy hill? 













###### 2 






He who walks and lives uprightly and blamelessly, who works rightness and justice and speaks and thinks the truth in his heart, 













###### 3 






He who does not slander with his tongue, nor does evil to his friend, nor takes up a reproach against his neighbor; 













###### 4 






In whose eyes a vile person is despised, but he who honors those who fear the Lord (who revere and worship Him); who swears to his own hurt and does not change; 













###### 5 






[He who] does not put out his money for interest [to one of his own people] and who will not take a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things shall never be moved.

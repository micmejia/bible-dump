# Psalms 2

***














###### 1 






Why do the nations assemble with commotion [uproar and confusion of voices], and why do the people imagine (meditate upon and devise) an empty scheme? 













###### 2 






The kings of the earth take their places; the rulers take counsel together against the Lord and His Anointed One (the Messiah, the Christ). They say, 













###### 3 






Let us break Their bands [of restraint] asunder and cast Their cords [of control] from us. 













###### 4 






He Who sits in the heavens laughs; the Lord has them in derision [and in supreme contempt He mocks them]. 













###### 5 






He speaks to them in His deep anger and troubles (terrifies and confounds) them in His displeasure and fury, saying, 













###### 6 






Yet have I anointed (installed and placed) My King [firmly] on My holy hill of Zion. 













###### 7 






I will declare the decree of the Lord: He said to Me, You are My Son; this day [I declare] I have begotten You. 













###### 8 






Ask of Me, and I will give You the nations as Your inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth as Your possession. 













###### 9 






You shall break them with a rod of iron; You shall dash them in pieces like potters' ware. 













###### 10 






Now therefore, O you kings, act wisely; be instructed and warned, O you rulers of the earth. 













###### 11 






Serve the Lord with reverent awe and worshipful fear; rejoice and be in high spirits with trembling [lest you displease Him]. 













###### 12 






Kiss the Son [pay homage to Him in purity], lest He be angry and you perish in the way, for soon shall His wrath be kindled. O blessed (happy, fortunate, and to be envied) are all those who seek refuge and put their trust in Him!

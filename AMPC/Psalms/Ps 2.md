# Psalms 2

***














###### 1 






Why do the nations assemble with commotion [uproar and confusion of voices], and why do the people imagine (meditate upon and devise) an empty scheme? 













###### 2 






The kings of the earth take their places; the rulers take counsel together against the Lord and His Anointed One (the Messiah, the Christ). _They say_, 













###### 3 






Let us break Their bands [of restraint] asunder and cast Their cords [of control] from us. 













###### 4 






He Who sits in the heavens laughs; the Lord has them in derision [and in supreme contempt He mocks them]. 













###### 5 






He speaks to them in His deep anger and troubles (terrifies and confounds) them in His displeasure _and_ fury, _saying_, 













###### 6 






Yet have I anointed (installed and placed) My King [firmly] on My holy hill of Zion. 













###### 7 






I will declare the decree of the Lord: He said to Me, You are My Son; this day [I declare] I have begotten You. 













###### 8 






Ask of Me, and I will give You the nations as Your inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth as Your possession. 













###### 9 






You shall break them with a rod of iron; You shall dash them in pieces like potters' ware. 













###### 10 






Now therefore, O you kings, act wisely; be instructed _and_ warned, O you rulers of the earth. 













###### 11 






Serve the Lord with reverent awe _and_ worshipful fear; rejoice _and_ be in high spirits with trembling [lest you displease Him]. 













###### 12 






Kiss the Son [pay homage to Him in purity], lest He be angry and you perish in the way, for soon shall His wrath be kindled. O blessed (happy, fortunate, and to be envied) are all those who seek refuge _and_ put their trust in Him! ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

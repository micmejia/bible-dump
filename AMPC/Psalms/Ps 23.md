# Psalms 23

***














###### 1 






The Lord is my Shepherd [to feed, guide, and shield me], I shall not lack. 













###### 2 






He makes me lie down in [fresh, tender] green pastures; He leads me beside the still _and_ restful waters. 













###### 3 






He refreshes _and_ restores my life (my self); He leads me in the paths of righteousness [uprightness and right standing with Him--not for my earning it, but] for His name's sake. 













###### 4 






Yes, though I walk through the [deep, sunless] valley of the shadow of death, I will fear _or_ dread no evil, for You are with me; Your rod [to protect] and Your staff [to guide], they comfort me. 













###### 5 






You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with [^a]oil; my [brimming] cup runs over. 













###### 6 






Surely _or_ only goodness, mercy, _and_ unfailing love shall follow me all the days of my life, and through the length of my days the house of the Lord [and His presence] shall be my dwelling place.

# Psalms 3

***














###### 1 






Lord, how they are increased who trouble me! Many are they who rise up against me. 













###### 2 






Many are saying of me, There is no help for him in God. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! 













###### 3 






But You, O Lord, are a shield for me, my glory, and the lifter of my head. 













###### 4 






With my voice I cry to the Lord, and He hears and answers me out of His holy hill. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! 













###### 5 






I lay down and slept; I wakened again, for the Lord sustains me. 













###### 6 






I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people who have set themselves against me round about. 













###### 7 






Arise, O Lord; save me, O my God! For You have struck all my enemies on the cheek; You have broken the teeth of the ungodly. 













###### 8 






Salvation belongs to the Lord; May Your blessing be upon Your people. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

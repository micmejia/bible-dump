# Psalms 36

***














###### 1 






Transgression [like an oracle] speaks to the wicked deep in his heart. There is no fear _or_ dread of God before his eyes. 













###### 2 






For he flatters _and_ deceives himself in his own eyes that his iniquity will not be found out and be hated. 













###### 3 






The words of his mouth are wrong and deceitful; he has ceased to be wise _and_ to do good. 













###### 4 






He plans wrongdoing on his bed; he sets himself in a way that is not good; he does not reject _or_ despise evil. 













###### 5 






Your mercy _and_ loving-kindness, O Lord, extend to the skies, _and_ Your faithfulness to the clouds. 













###### 6 






Your righteousness is like the mountains of God, Your judgments are like the great deep. O Lord, You preserve man and beast. 













###### 7 






How precious is Your steadfast love, O God! The children of men take refuge _and_ put their trust under the shadow of Your wings. 













###### 8 






They relish _and_ feast on the abundance of Your house; and You cause them to drink of the stream of Your pleasures. 













###### 9 






For with You is the fountain of life; in Your light do we see light. 













###### 10 






O continue Your loving-kindness to those who know You, Your righteousness (salvation) to the upright in heart. 













###### 11 






Let not the foot of pride overtake me, and let not the hand of the wicked drive me away. 













###### 12 






There the workers of iniquity fall _and_ lie prostrate; they are thrust down and shall not be able to rise.

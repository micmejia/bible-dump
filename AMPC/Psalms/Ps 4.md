# Psalms 4

***














###### 1 






Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness (uprightness, justice, and right standing with You)! You have freed me when I was hemmed in _and_ enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me and hear my prayer. 













###### 2 






O you sons of men, how long will you turn my honor _and_ glory into shame? How long will you love vanity _and_ futility _and_ seek after lies? Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! 













###### 3 






But know that the Lord has set apart for Himself [and given distinction to] him who is godly [the man of loving-kindness]. The Lord listens _and_ heeds when I call to Him. 













###### 4 






Be angry [or stand in awe] and sin not; commune with your own hearts upon your beds and be silent (sorry for the things you say in your hearts). Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! 













###### 5 






Offer just _and_ right sacrifices; trust (lean on and be confident) in the Lord. 













###### 6 






Many say, Oh, that we might see some good! Lift up the light of Your countenance upon us, O Lord. 













###### 7 






You have put more joy _and_ rejoicing in my heart than [they know] when their wheat and new wine have yielded abundantly. 













###### 8 






In peace I will both lie down and sleep, for You, Lord, alone make me dwell in safety _and_ confident trust.

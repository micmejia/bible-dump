# Psalms 43

***














###### 1 






Judge _and_ vindicate me, O God; plead and defend my cause against an ungodly nation. O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man! 













###### 2 






For You are the God of my strength [my Stronghold--in Whom I take refuge]; why have You cast me off? Why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy? 













###### 3 






O send out Your light and Your truth, let them lead me; let them bring me to Your holy hill and to Your dwelling. 













###### 4 






Then will I go to the altar of God, to God, my exceeding joy; yes, with the lyre will I praise You, O God, my God! 













###### 5 






Why are you cast down, O my inner self? And why should you moan over me _and_ be disquieted within me? Hope in God _and_ wait expectantly for Him, for I shall yet praise Him, Who is the help of my [sad] countenance, and my God. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Psalms 47

***


###### 1 


O clap your hands, all you peoples! Shout to God with the voice of triumph and songs of joy! 


###### 2 


For the Lord Most High excites terror, awe, and dread; He is a great King over all the earth. 


###### 3 


He subdued peoples under us, and nations under our feet. 


###### 4 


He chose our inheritance for us, the glory and pride of Jacob, whom He loves. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! 


###### 5 


God has ascended amid shouting, the Lord with the sound of a trumpet. 


###### 6 


Sing praises to God, sing praises! Sing praises to our King, sing praises! 


###### 7 


For God is the King of all the earth; sing praises in a skillful psalm and with understanding. 


###### 8 


God reigns over the nations; God sits upon His holy throne. 


###### 9 


The princes and nobles of the peoples are gathered together, a [united] people for the God of Abraham, for the shields of the earth belong to God; He is highly exalted.

# Psalms 5

***














###### 1 






Listen to my words, O Lord, give heed to my sighing _and_ groaning. 













###### 2 






Hear the sound of my cry, my King and my God, for to You do I pray. 













###### 3 






In the morning You hear my voice, O Lord; in the morning I prepare [a prayer, a sacrifice] for You and watch _and_ wait [for You to speak to my heart]. 













###### 4 






For You are not a God Who takes pleasure in wickedness; neither will the evil [man] so much as dwell [temporarily] with You. 













###### 5 






Boasters can have no standing in Your sight; You abhor all evildoers. 













###### 6 






You will destroy those who speak lies; the Lord abhors [and rejects] the bloodthirsty and deceitful man. 













###### 7 






But as for me, I will enter Your house through the abundance of Your steadfast love _and_ mercy; I will worship toward _and_ at Your holy temple in reverent fear _and_ awe of You. 













###### 8 






Lead me, O Lord, in Your righteousness because of my enemies; make Your way level (straight and right) before my face. 













###### 9 






For there is nothing trustworthy _or_ steadfast _or_ truthful in their talk; their heart is destruction [or a destructive chasm, a yawning gulf]; their throat is an open sepulcher; they flatter and make smooth with their tongue. 













###### 10 






Hold them guilty, O God; let them fall by their own designs _and_ counsels; cast them out because of the multitude of their transgressions, for they have rebelled against You. 













###### 11 






But let all those who take refuge _and_ put their trust in You rejoice; let them ever sing _and_ shout for joy, because You make a covering over them _and_ defend them; let those also who love Your name be joyful in You _and_ be in high spirits. 













###### 12 






For You, Lord, will bless the [uncompromisingly] righteous [him who is upright and in right standing with You]; as with a shield You will surround him with goodwill (pleasure and favor).

# Psalms 53

***


###### 1 


The [empty-headed] fool has said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt and evil are they, and doing abominable iniquity; there is none who does good. 


###### 2 


God looked down from heaven upon the children of men to see if there were any who understood, who sought (inquired after and desperately required) God. 


###### 3 


Every one of them has gone back [backslidden and fallen away]; they have altogether become filthy and corrupt; there is none who does good, no, not one. 


###### 4 


Have those who work evil no knowledge (no understanding)? They eat up My people as they eat bread; they do not call upon God. 


###### 5 


There they are, in terror and dread, where there was [and had been] no terror and dread! For God has scattered the bones of him who encamps against you; you have put them to shame, because God has rejected them. 


###### 6 


Oh, that the salvation and deliverance of Israel would come out of Zion! When God restores the fortunes of His people, then will Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad.

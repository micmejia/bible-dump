# Psalms 54

***














###### 1 






Save me, O God, by Your name; judge _and_ vindicate me by Your mighty strength _and_ power. 













###### 2 






Hear my pleading _and_ my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth. 













###### 3 






For strangers _and_ insolent men are rising up against me, and violent men _and_ ruthless ones seek _and_ demand my life; they do not set God before them. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! 













###### 4 






Behold, God is my helper _and_ ally; the Lord is my upholder _and_ is with them who uphold my life. 













###### 5 






He will pay back evil to my enemies; in Your faithfulness [Lord] put an end to them. 













###### 6 






With a freewill offering I will sacrifice to You; I will give thanks _and_ praise Your name, O Lord, for it is good. 













###### 7 






For He has delivered me out of every trouble, and my eye has looked [in triumph] on my enemies.

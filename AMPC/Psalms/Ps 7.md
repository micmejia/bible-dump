# Psalms 7

***














###### 1 






O Lord my God, in You I take refuge _and_ put my trust; save me from all those who pursue _and_ persecute me, and deliver me, 













###### 2 






Lest my foe tear my life [from my body] like a lion, dragging _me_ away while there is none to deliver. 













###### 3 






O Lord my God, if I have done this, if there is wrong in my hands, 













###### 4 






If I have paid back with evil him who was at peace with me or without cause have robbed him who was my enemy, 













###### 5 






Let the enemy pursue my life and take it; yes, let him trample my life to the ground and lay my honor in the dust. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! 













###### 6 






Arise, O Lord, in Your anger; lift up Yourself against the rage of my enemies; and awake [and stir up] for me the justice _and_ vindication [that] You have commanded. 













###### 7 






Let the assembly of the peoples be gathered about You, and return on high over them. 













###### 8 






The Lord judges the people; judge me, O Lord, _and_ do me justice according to my righteousness [my rightness, justice, and right standing with You] and according to the integrity that is in me. 













###### 9 






Oh, let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, but establish the [uncompromisingly] righteous [those upright and in harmony with You]; for You, Who try the hearts and emotions _and_ thinking powers, are a righteous God. 













###### 10 






My defense _and_ shield depend on God, Who saves the upright in heart. 













###### 11 






God is a righteous Judge, yes, a God Who is indignant every day. 













###### 12 






If a man does not turn _and_ repent, [God] will whet His sword; He has strung _and_ bent His [huge] bow and made it ready [by treading it with His foot]. 













###### 13 






He has also prepared for him deadly weapons; He makes His arrows fiery shafts. 













###### 14 






Behold, [the wicked man] conceives iniquity and is pregnant with mischief and gives birth to lies. 













###### 15 






He made a pit and hollowed it out and has fallen into the hole which he made [before the trap was completed]. 













###### 16 






His mischief shall fall back in return upon his own head, and his violence come down [with the loose dirt] upon his own scalp. 













###### 17 






I will give to the Lord the thanks due to His rightness _and_ justice, and I will sing praise to the name of the Lord Most High. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

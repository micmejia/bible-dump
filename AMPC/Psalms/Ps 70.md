# Psalms 70

***














###### 1 






Make haste, O God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O Lord! 













###### 2 






Let them be put to shame _and_ confounded that seek _and_ demand my life; let them be turned backward and brought to confusion _and_ dishonor who desire _and_ delight in my hurt. 













###### 3 






Let them be turned back _and_ appalled because of their shame _and_ disgrace who say, Aha, aha! 













###### 4 






May all those who seek, inquire of _and_ for You, _and_ require You [as their vital need] rejoice and be glad in You; and may those who love Your salvation say continually, Let God be magnified! 













###### 5 






But I am poor and needy; hasten to me, O God! You are my Help and my Deliverer; O Lord, do not tarry!

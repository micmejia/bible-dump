# Psalms 75

***














###### 1 






We give praise and thanks to You, O God, we praise and give thanks; Your wondrous works declare that Your Name is near and they who invoke Your Name rehearse Your wonders. 













###### 2 






When the proper time has come [for executing My judgments], I will judge uprightly [says the Lord]. 













###### 3 






When the earth totters, and all the inhabitants of it, it is I Who will poise and keep steady its pillars. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! 













###### 4 






I said to the arrogant and boastful, Deal not arrogantly [do not boast]; and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn [of personal aggrandizement]. 













###### 5 






Lift not up your [aggressive] horn on high, speak not with a stiff neck and insolent arrogance. 













###### 6 






For not from the east nor from the west nor from the south come promotion and lifting up. 













###### 7 






But God is the Judge! He puts down one and lifts up another. 













###### 8 






For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup [of His wrath], and the wine foams and is red, well mixed; and He pours out from it, and all the wicked of the earth must drain it and drink its dregs. 













###### 9 






But I will declare and rejoice forever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob. 













###### 10 






All the horns of the ungodly also will I cut off [says the Lord], but the horns of the [uncompromisingly] righteous shall be exalted.

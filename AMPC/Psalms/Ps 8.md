# Psalms 8

***


###### 1 


O Lord, our Lord, how excellent (majestic and glorious) is Your name in all the earth! You have set Your glory on [or above] the heavens. 


###### 2 


Out of the mouths of babes and unweaned infants You have established strength because of Your foes, that You might silence the enemy and the avenger. 


###### 3 


When I view and consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, the moon and the stars, which You have ordained and established, 


###### 4 


What is man that You are mindful of him, and the son of [earthborn] man that You care for him? 


###### 5 


Yet You have made him but a little lower than God [or heavenly beings], and You have crowned him with glory and honor. 


###### 6 


You made him to have dominion over the works of Your hands; You have put all things under his feet: 


###### 7 


All sheep and oxen, yes, and the beasts of the field, 


###### 8 


The birds of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatever passes along the paths of the seas. 


###### 9 


O Lord, our Lord, how excellent (majestic and glorious) is Your name in all the earth!

# Psalms 8

***














###### 1 






O Lord, our Lord, how excellent (majestic and glorious) is Your name in all the earth! You have set Your glory on [or above] the heavens. 













###### 2 






Out of the mouths of babes and unweaned infants You have established strength because of Your foes, that You might silence the enemy and the avenger. 













###### 3 






When I view _and_ consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, the moon and the stars, which You have ordained _and_ established, 













###### 4 






What is man that You are mindful of him, and the son of [earthborn] man that You care for him? 













###### 5 






Yet You have made him but a little lower than God [or heavenly beings], and You have crowned him with glory and honor. 













###### 6 






You made him to have dominion over the works of Your hands; You have put all things under his feet: 













###### 7 






All sheep and oxen, yes, and the beasts of the field, 













###### 8 






The birds of the air, and the fish of the sea, _and_ whatever passes along the paths of the seas. 













###### 9

# Psalms 93

***














###### 1 






The Lord reigns, He is clothed with majesty; the Lord is robed, He has girded Himself with strength _and_ power; the world also is established, that it cannot be moved. 













###### 2 






Your throne is established from of old; You are from everlasting. 













###### 3 






The floods have lifted up, O Lord, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up the roaring of their waves. 













###### 4 






The Lord on high is mightier _and_ more glorious than the noise of many waters, yes, than the mighty breakers _and_ waves of the sea. 













###### 5 






Your testimonies are very sure; holiness [apparent in separation from sin, with simple trust and hearty obedience] is becoming to Your house, O Lord, forever.

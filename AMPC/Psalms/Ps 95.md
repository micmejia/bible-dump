# Psalms 95

***














###### 1 






O come, let us sing to the Lord; let us make a joyful noise to the Rock of our salvation! 













###### 2 






Let us come before His presence with thanksgiving; let us make a joyful noise to Him with songs of praise! 













###### 3 






For the Lord is a great God, and a great King above all gods. 













###### 4 






In His hand are the deep places of the earth; the heights _and_ strength of the hills are His also. 













###### 5 






The sea is His, for He made it; and His hands formed the dry land. 













###### 6 






O come, let us worship and bow down, let us kneel before the Lord our Maker [in reverent praise and supplication]. 













###### 7 






For He is our God and we are the people of His pasture and the sheep of His hand. Today, if you will hear His voice, 













###### 8 






Harden not your hearts as at Meribah and as at Massah in the day of temptation in the wilderness, 













###### 9 






When your fathers tried My patience _and_ tested Me, proved Me, and saw My work [of judgment]. 













###### 10 






Forty years long was I grieved _and_ disgusted with that generation, and I said, It is a people that do err in their hearts, and they do not approve, acknowledge, _or_ regard My ways. 













###### 11 






Wherefore I swore in My wrath that they would not enter My rest [the land of promise].

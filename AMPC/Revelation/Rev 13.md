# Revelation 13

***














###### 1 






[As] [^a]I stood on the sandy beach, I saw a beast coming up out of the sea with ten horns and seven heads. On his horns he had ten royal crowns (diadems) and blasphemous titles (names) on his heads. 













###### 2 






And the beast that I saw resembled a leopard, but his feet were like those of a bear and his mouth was like that of a lion. And to him the dragon gave his [own] might _and_ power and his [own] throne and great dominion. 













###### 3 






And one of his heads seemed to have a deadly wound. But his death stroke was healed; and the whole earth went after the beast in amazement _and_ admiration. 













###### 4 






They fell down _and_ paid homage to the dragon, because he had bestowed on the beast all his dominion _and_ authority; they also praised _and_ worshiped the beast, exclaiming, Who is a match for the beast, and, Who can make war against him? 













###### 5 






And the beast was given the power of speech, uttering boastful and blasphemous words, and he was given freedom to exert his authority _and_ to exercise his will during forty-two months (three and a half years). 













###### 6 






And he opened his mouth to speak slanders against God, blaspheming His name and His abode, [even vilifying] those who live in heaven. 













###### 7 






He was further permitted to wage war on God's holy people (the saints) and to overcome them. And power was given him to extend his authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation, 













###### 8 






And all the inhabitants of the earth will fall down in adoration _and_ pay him homage, everyone whose name has not been recorded in the Book of Life of the Lamb that was slain [in sacrifice] [^b]from the foundation of the world. 













###### 9 






If anyone is able to hear, let him listen: 













###### 10 






Whoever leads into captivity will himself go into captivity; if anyone slays with the sword, with the sword must he be slain. Herein is [the call for] the patience and the faith _and_ fidelity of the saints (God's people). 













###### 11 






Then I saw another beast rising up out of the land [itself]; he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke (roared) like a dragon. 













###### 12 






He exerts all the power _and_ right of control of the former beast in his presence, and causes the earth and those who dwell upon it to exalt _and_ deify the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed, _and_ to worship him. 













###### 13 






He performs great signs (startling miracles), even making fire fall from the sky to the earth in men's sight. 













###### 14 






And because of the signs (miracles) which he is allowed to perform in the presence of the [first] beast, he deceives those who inhabit the earth, commanding them to erect a statue (an image) in the likeness of the beast who was wounded by the [small] sword and still lived. 













###### 15 






And he is permitted [also] to impart the breath of life into the beast's image, so that the statue of the beast could actually talk and cause to be put to death those who would not bow down _and_ worship the image of the beast. 













###### 16 






Also he compels all [alike], both small and great, both the rich and the poor, both free and slave, to be marked with an inscription [[^c]stamped] on their right hands or on their foreheads, 













###### 17 






So that no one will have power to buy or sell unless he bears the stamp (mark, inscription), [that is] the name of the beast or the number of his name. 













###### 18 






Here is [room for] discernment [a call for the wisdom [^d]of interpretation]. Let anyone who has intelligence (penetration and insight enough) calculate the number of the beast, for it is a human number [the number of a certain man]; his number is 666. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

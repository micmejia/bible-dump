# Revelation 17

***


###### 1 


One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls then came and spoke to me, saying, Come with me! I will show you the doom (sentence, judgment) of the great harlot (idolatress) who is seated on many waters, 


###### 2 


[She] with whom the rulers of the earth have joined in prostitution (idolatry) and with the wine of whose immorality (idolatry) the inhabitants of the earth have become intoxicated. 


###### 3 


And [the angel] bore me away [rapt] in the Spirit into a desert (wilderness), and I saw a woman seated on a scarlet beast that was all covered with blasphemous titles (names), and he had seven heads and ten horns. 


###### 4 


The woman was robed in purple and scarlet and bedecked with gold, precious stones, and pearls, [and she was] holding in her hand a golden cup full of the accursed offenses and the filth of her lewdness _and_ vice. 


###### 5 


And on her forehead there was inscribed a name of mystery [with a secret symbolic meaning]: Babylon the great, the mother of prostitutes (idolatresses) and of the filth _and_ atrocities _and_ abominations of the earth. 


###### 6 


I also saw that the woman was drunk, [drunk] with the blood of the saints (God's people) and the blood of the martyrs [who witnessed] for Jesus. And when I saw her, I was utterly amazed _and_ wondered greatly. 


###### 7 


But the angel said to me, Why do you wonder? I will explain to you the [secret symbolic meaning of the] mystery of the woman, as well as of the beast having the seven heads and ten horns that carries her. 


###### 8 


The beast that you saw [once] was, but [now] is no more, and he is going to come up out of the Abyss (the bottomless pit) and proceed to go to perdition. And the inhabitants of the earth whose names have not been recorded in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world will be astonished when they look at the beast, because he [once] was, but [now] is no more, and he is [yet] to come. 


###### 9 


This calls for a mind [to consider that is packed] with wisdom _and_ intelligence [it is something for a particular mode of thinking and judging of thoughts, feelings, and purposes]. The seven heads are seven hills upon which the woman is sitting; 


###### 10 


And they are also seven kings, five of whom have fallen, one still exists [and is reigning]; the other [the seventh] has not yet appeared, and when he does arrive, he must stay [but] a brief time. 


###### 11 


And as for the beast that [once] was, but now is no more, he [himself] is an eighth ruler (king, head), but he is of the seven _and_ belongs to them, and he goes to perdition. 


###### 12 


Also the ten horns that you observed are ten rulers (kings) who have as yet received no royal dominion, but together they are to receive power _and_ authority as rulers for a single hour, along with the beast. 


###### 13 


These have one common policy (opinion, purpose), and they deliver their power and authority to the beast. 


###### 14 


They will wage war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will triumph over them; for He is Lord of lords and King of kings--and those with Him _and_ on His side are chosen and called [elected] and loyal _and_ faithful followers. 


###### 15 


And [the angel further] said to me, The waters that you observed, where the harlot is seated, are races and multitudes and nations and dialects (languages). 


###### 16 


And the ten horns that you saw, they and the beast will [be the very ones to] hate the harlot (the idolatrous woman); they will make her cheerless (bereaved, desolate), and they will strip her and eat up her flesh and utterly consume her with fire. 


###### 17 


For God has put it into their hearts to carry out His own purpose by acting in harmony in surrendering their royal power _and_ authority to the beast, until the prophetic words (intentions and promises) of God shall be fulfilled. 


###### 18 


And the woman that you saw is herself the great city which dominates _and_ controls the rulers _and_ the leaders of the earth.

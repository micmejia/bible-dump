# Revelation 19

***


###### 1 


After this I heard what sounded like a mighty shout of a great crowd in heaven, exclaiming, Hallelujah (praise the Lord)! Salvation and glory (splendor and majesty) and power (dominion and authority) [belong] to our God! 


###### 2 


Because His judgments (His condemnation and punishment, His sentences of doom) are true _and_ sound and just _and_ upright. He has judged (convicted, pronounced sentence, and doomed) the great _and_ notorious harlot (idolatress) who corrupted _and_ demoralized _and_ poisoned the earth with her lewdness _and_ adultery (idolatry). And He has avenged (visited on her the penalty for) the blood of His servants at her hand. 


###### 3 


And again they shouted, Hallelujah (praise the Lord)! The smoke of her [burning] shall continue to ascend forever and ever (through the eternities of the eternities). 


###### 4 


Then the twenty-four elders [of the heavenly Sanhedrin] and the four living creatures fell prostrate and worshiped [paying divine honors to] God, Who sits on the throne, saying, Amen! Hallelujah (praise the Lord)! 


###### 5 


Then from the throne there came a voice, saying, Praise our God, all you servants of His, you who reverence Him, both small and great! 


###### 6 


After that I heard what sounded like the shout of a vast throng, like the boom of many pounding waves, and like the roar of terrific _and_ mighty peals of thunder, exclaiming, Hallelujah (praise the Lord)! For now the Lord our God the Omnipotent (the All-Ruler) reigns! 


###### 7 


Let us rejoice and shout for joy [exulting and triumphant]! Let us celebrate _and_ ascribe to Him glory _and_ honor, for the marriage of the Lamb [at last] has come, and His bride has prepared herself. 


###### 8 


She has been permitted to dress in fine (radiant) linen, dazzling and white--for the fine linen is (signifies, represents) the righteousness (the upright, just, and godly living, deeds, and conduct, and right standing with God) of the saints (God's holy people). 


###### 9 


Then [the angel] said to me, Write this down: Blessed (happy, to be envied) are those who are summoned (invited, called) to the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he said to me [further], These are the true words (the genuine and exact declarations) of God. 


###### 10 


Then I fell prostrate at his feet to worship (to pay divine honors) to him, but he [restrained me] and said, Refrain! [You must not do that!] I am [only] another servant with you and your brethren who have [accepted and hold] the testimony borne by Jesus. Worship God! For the substance (essence) of the truth revealed by Jesus is the spirit of all prophecy [the vital breath, the inspiration of all inspired preaching and interpretation of the divine will and purpose, including both mine and yours]. 


###### 11 


After that I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse [appeared]! The One Who was riding it is called Faithful (Trustworthy, Loyal, Incorruptible, Steady) and True, and He passes judgment and wages war in righteousness (holiness, justice, and uprightness). 


###### 12 


His eyes [blaze] like a flame of fire, and on His head are many kingly crowns (diadems); and He has a title (name) inscribed which He alone knows _or_ can understand. 


###### 13 


He is dressed in a robe dyed by dipping in blood, and the title by which He is called is The Word of God. 


###### 14 


And the troops of heaven, clothed in fine linen, dazzling and clean, followed Him on white horses. 


###### 15 


From His mouth goes forth a sharp sword with which He can smite (afflict, strike) the nations; and He will shepherd _and_ control them with a staff (scepter, rod) of iron. He will tread the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath _and_ indignation of God the All-Ruler (the Almighty, the Omnipotent). 


###### 16 


And on His garment (robe) and on His thigh He has a name (title) inscribed, king of kings and lord of lords. 


###### 17 


Then I saw a single angel stationed in the sun's light, and with a mighty voice he shouted to all the birds that fly across the sky, Come, gather yourselves together for the great supper of God, 


###### 18 


That you may feast on the flesh of rulers, the flesh of generals _and_ captains, the flesh of powerful _and_ mighty men, the flesh of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all humanity, both free and slave, both small and great! 


###### 19 


Then I saw the beast and the rulers _and_ leaders of the earth with their troops mustered to go into battle _and_ make war against Him Who is mounted on the horse and against His troops. 


###### 20 


And the beast was seized _and_ overpowered, and with him the false prophet who in his presence had worked wonders _and_ performed miracles by which he led astray those who had accepted _or_ permitted to be placed upon them the stamp (mark) of the beast and those who paid homage _and_ gave divine honors to his statue. Both of them were hurled alive into the fiery lake that burns _and_ blazes with brimstone. 


###### 21 


And the rest were killed with the sword that issues from the mouth of Him Who is mounted on the horse, and all the birds fed ravenously _and_ glutted themselves with their flesh.

# Revelation 2

***














###### 1 






To the angel (messenger) of the assembly (church) in Ephesus write: These are the words of Him Who holds the seven stars [which are the messengers of the seven churches] in His right hand, Who goes about among the seven golden lampstands [which are the seven churches]: 













###### 2 






I know your industry _and_ activities, laborious toil _and_ trouble, and your patient endurance, and how you cannot tolerate wicked [men] and have tested _and_ critically appraised those who call [themselves] apostles (special messengers of Christ) and yet are not, and have found them to be impostors _and_ liars. 













###### 3 






I know you are enduring patiently and are bearing up for My name's sake, and you have not fainted _or_ become exhausted _or_ grown weary. 













###### 4 






But I have this [one charge to make] against you: that you have left (abandoned) the love that you had at first [you have deserted Me, your first love]. 













###### 5 






Remember then from what heights you have fallen. Repent (change the inner man to meet God's will) and do the works you did previously [when first you knew the Lord], or else I will visit you and remove your lampstand from its place, unless you change your mind _and_ repent. 













###### 6 






Yet you have this [in your favor and to your credit]: you hate the works of the Nicolaitans [what they are doing as corrupters of the people], which I Myself also detest. 













###### 7 






He who is able to hear, let him listen to _and_ give heed to what the Spirit says to the assemblies (churches). To him who overcomes (is victorious), I will grant to eat [of the fruit] of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God. 













###### 8 






And to the angel (messenger) of the assembly (church) in Smyrna write: These are the words of the First and the Last, Who died and came to life again: 













###### 9 






I know your affliction _and_ distress _and_ pressing trouble and your poverty--but you are rich! and how you are abused _and_ reviled _and_ slandered by those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan. 













###### 10 






Fear nothing that you are about to suffer. [Dismiss your dread and your fears!] Behold, the devil is indeed about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested _and_ proved _and_ critically appraised, and for ten days you will have affliction. Be loyally faithful unto death [even if you must die for it], and I will give you the crown of life. 













###### 11 






He who is able to hear, let him listen to _and_ heed what the Spirit says to the assemblies (churches). He who overcomes (is victorious) shall in no way be injured by the second death. 













###### 12 






Then to the angel (messenger) of the assembly (church) in Pergamum write: These are the words of Him Who has _and_ wields the sharp two-edged sword: 













###### 13 






I know where you live--a place where Satan sits enthroned. [Yet] you are clinging to _and_ holding fast My name, and you did not deny My faith, even in the days of Antipas, My witness, My faithful one, who was killed (martyred) in your midst--where Satan dwells. 













###### 14 






Nevertheless, I have a few things against you: you have some people there who are clinging to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to set a trap _and_ a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, [to entice them] to eat food that had been sacrificed to idols and to practice lewdness [giving themselves up to sexual vice]. 













###### 15 






You also have some who in a similar way are clinging to the teaching of the Nicolaitans [those corrupters of the people] _which thing I hate_. 













###### 16 






Repent [then]! Or else I will come to you quickly and fight against them with the sword of My mouth. 













###### 17 






He who is able to hear, let him listen to _and_ heed what the Spirit says to the assemblies (churches). To him who overcomes (conquers), I will give to eat of the manna that is hidden, and I will give him a white stone with a new name engraved on the stone, which no one knows _or_ understands except he who receives it. 













###### 18 






And to the angel (messenger) of the assembly (church) in Thyatira write: These are the words of the Son of God, Who has eyes that flash like a flame of fire, and Whose feet glow like bright _and_ burnished _and_ white-hot bronze: 













###### 19 






I know your record _and_ what you are doing, your love and faith and service and patient endurance, and that your recent works are more numerous _and_ greater than your first ones. 













###### 20 






But I have this against you: that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess [claiming to be inspired], and who is teaching and leading astray my servants _and_ beguiling them into practicing sexual vice and eating food sacrificed to idols. 













###### 21 






I gave her time to repent, but she has no desire to repent of her immorality [symbolic of idolatry] _and_ refuses to do so. 













###### 22 






Take note: I will throw her on a bed [[^a]of anguish], and those who commit adultery with her [her paramours] I will bring down to [^b]pressing distress _and_ severe affliction, unless they turn away their minds from conduct [such as] hers _and_ repent of [^c]_their_ doings. 













###### 23 






And I will strike her children (her proper followers) dead [thoroughly exterminating them]. And all the assemblies (churches) shall recognize _and_ understand that I am He Who searches minds (the thoughts, feelings, and purposes) and the [inmost] hearts, and I will give to each of you [the reward for what you have done] as your work deserves. 













###### 24 






But to the rest of you in Thyatira, who do not hold this teaching, who have not explored _and_ known the depths of Satan, as they say--I tell you that I do not lay upon you any other [fresh] burden: 













###### 25 






Only hold fast to what you have until I come. 













###### 26 






And he who overcomes (is victorious) and who obeys My commands to the [very] end [doing the works that please Me], I will give him authority _and_ power over the nations; 













###### 27 






And he shall rule them with a sceptre (rod) of iron, as when earthen pots are broken in pieces, and [his power over them shall be] like that which I Myself have received from My Father; 













###### 28 






And I will give him the Morning Star. 













###### 29 






He who is able to hear, let him listen to _and_ heed what the [Holy] Spirit says to the assemblies (churches). ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

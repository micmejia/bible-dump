# Revelation 22

***














###### 1 






Then he showed me the river whose waters give life, sparkling like crystal, flowing out from the throne of God and of the Lamb 













###### 2 






Through the middle of the broadway of the city; also, on either side of the river was the tree of life with its twelve varieties of fruit, yielding each month its fresh crop; and the leaves of the tree were for the healing _and_ the restoration of the nations. 













###### 3 






There shall no longer exist there anything that is accursed (detestable, foul, offensive, impure, hateful, or horrible). But the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and His servants shall worship Him [pay divine honors to Him and do Him holy service]. 













###### 4 






They shall see His face, and His name shall be on their foreheads. 













###### 5 






And there shall be no more night; they have no need for lamplight or sunlight, for the Lord God will illuminate them _and_ be their light, and they shall reign [as kings] forever and ever (through the eternities of the eternities). 













###### 6 






And he [of the seven angels further] said to me, These statements are reliable (worthy of confidence) and genuine (true). And the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent His messenger (angel) to make known _and_ exhibit to His servants what must soon come to pass. 













###### 7 






And behold, I am coming speedily. Blessed (happy and to be envied) is he who observes _and_ lays to heart _and_ keeps the truths of the prophecy (the predictions, consolations, and warnings) contained in this [little] book. 













###### 8 






And I, John, am he who heard and witnessed these things. And when I heard and saw them, I fell prostrate before the feet of the messenger (angel) who showed them to me, to worship him. 













###### 9 






But he said to me, Refrain! [You must not do that!] I am [only] a fellow servant along with yourself and with your brethren the prophets and with those who are mindful of _and_ practice [the truths contained in] the messages of this book. Worship God! 













###### 10 






And he [further] told me, Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book _and_ make no secret of them, for the time when things are brought to a crisis _and_ the period of their fulfillment is near. 













###### 11 






He who is unrighteous (unjust, wicked), let him be unrighteous still; and he who is filthy (vile, impure), let him be filthy still; and he who is righteous (just, upright, in right standing with God), let him do right still; and he who is holy, let him be holy still. 













###### 12 






Behold, I am coming soon, and I shall bring My wages _and_ rewards with Me, to repay _and_ render to each one just what his own actions _and_ his own work merit. 













###### 13 






I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last (the Before all and the End of all). 













###### 14 






Blessed (happy and to be envied) are those who cleanse their garments, that they may have the authority _and_ right to [approach] the tree of life and to enter through the gates into the city. 













###### 15 






[But] without are the dogs and those who practice sorceries (magic arts) and impurity [the lewd, adulterers] and the murderers and idolaters and everyone who loves and deals in falsehood (untruth, error, deception, cheating). 













###### 16 






I, Jesus, have sent My messenger (angel) to you to witness _and_ to give you assurance of these things for the churches (assemblies). I am the Root (the Source) and the Offspring of David, the radiant _and_ brilliant Morning Star. 













###### 17 






The [Holy] Spirit and the bride (the church, the true Christians) say, Come! And let him who is listening say, Come! And let everyone come who is thirsty [who is painfully conscious of his need of those things by which the soul is refreshed, supported, and strengthened]; and whoever [earnestly] desires to do it, let him come, take, appropriate, _and_ drink the water of Life without cost. 













###### 18 






I [personally solemnly] warn everyone who listens to the statements of the prophecy [the predictions and the consolations and admonitions pertaining to them] in this book: If anyone shall add anything to them, God will add _and_ lay upon him the plagues (the afflictions and the calamities) that are recorded _and_ described in this book. 













###### 19 






And if anyone cancels _or_ takes away from the statements of the book of this prophecy [these predictions relating to Christ's kingdom and its speedy triumph, together with the consolations and admonitions or warnings pertaining to them], God will cancel _and_ take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the city of holiness (purity and hallowedness), which are described _and_ promised in this book. 













###### 20 






He Who gives this warning _and_ affirms _and_ testifies to these things says, Yes (it is true). [Surely] I am coming quickly (swiftly, speedily). Amen (so let it be)! Yes, come, Lord Jesus! 













###### 21 






The grace (blessing and favor) of the Lord Jesus _Christ (the Messiah)_ be with all the saints (God's holy people, those set apart for God, to be, as it were, exclusively His). Amen (so let it be)!

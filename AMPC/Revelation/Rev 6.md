# Revelation 6

***


###### 1 


Then I saw as the Lamb broke open one of the seven seals, and as if in a voice of thunder I heard one of the four living creatures call out, Come! 


###### 2 


And I looked, and saw there a white horse whose rider carried a bow. And a crown was given him, and he rode forth conquering and to conquer. 


###### 3 


And when He broke the second seal, I heard the second living creature call out, Come! 


###### 4 


And another horse came out, flaming red. And its rider was empowered to take the peace from the earth, so that men slaughtered one another; and he was given a huge sword. 


###### 5 


When He broke open the third seal, I heard the third living creature call out, Come _and look_! And I saw, and behold, a black horse, and in his hand the rider had a pair of scales (a balance). 


###### 6 


And I heard what seemed to be a voice from the midst of the four living creatures, saying, A quart of wheat for a denarius [a whole day's wages], and three quarts of barley for a denarius; but do not harm the oil and the wine! 


###### 7 


When the Lamb broke open the fourth seal, I heard the fourth living creature call out, Come! 


###### 8 


So I looked, and behold, an ashy pale horse [black and blue as if made so by bruising], and its rider's name was Death, and Hades (the realm of the dead) followed him closely. And they were given authority _and_ power over a fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword and with famine and with plague (pestilence, disease) and with wild beasts of the earth. 


###### 9 


When the Lamb broke open the fifth seal, I saw at the foot of the altar the souls of those whose lives had been sacrificed for [adhering to] the Word of God and for the testimony they had borne. 


###### 10 


They cried in a loud voice, O [Sovereign] Lord, holy and true, how long now before You will sit in judgment and avenge our blood upon those who dwell on the earth? 


###### 11 


Then they were each given a long _and_ flowing _and_ festive white robe and told to rest _and_ wait patiently a little while longer, until the number should be complete of their fellow servants and their brethren who were to be killed as they themselves had been. 


###### 12 


When He [the Lamb] broke open the sixth seal, I looked, and there was a great earthquake; and the sun grew black as sackcloth of hair, [the full disc of] the moon became like blood. 


###### 13 


And the stars of the sky dropped to the earth like a fig tree shedding its unripe fruit out of season when shaken by a strong wind. 


###### 14 


And the sky rolled up like a scroll _and_ vanished, and every mountain and island was dislodged from its place. 


###### 15 


Then the kings of the earth and their noblemen and their magnates and their military chiefs and the wealthy and the strong and [everyone, whether] slave or free hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains, 


###### 16 


And they called to the mountains and the rocks, Fall on (before) us and hide us from the face of Him Who sits on the throne and from the deep-seated indignation _and_ wrath of the Lamb. 


###### 17 


For the great day of His wrath (vengeance, retribution, indignation) has come, and who is able to stand before it?

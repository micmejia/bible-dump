# Romans 1

***














###### 1 






From Paul, a bond servant of Jesus Christ (the Messiah) called to be an apostle, (a special messenger) set apart to [preach] the Gospel (good news) of _and_ from God, 













###### 2 






Which He promised in advance [long ago] through His prophets in the sacred Scriptures-- 













###### 3 






[The Gospel] regarding His Son, Who as to the flesh (His human nature) was descended from David, 













###### 4 






And [as to His divine nature] according to the Spirit of holiness was openly [^a]designated the Son of God in power [in a striking, triumphant and miraculous manner] by His resurrection from the dead, even Jesus Christ our Lord (the Messiah, the Anointed One). 













###### 5 






It is through Him that we have received grace (God's unmerited favor) and [our] apostleship to promote obedience to the faith _and_ make disciples for His name's sake among all the nations, 













###### 6 






And this includes you, called of Jesus Christ _and_ invited [as you are] to belong to Him. 













###### 7 






To [you then] all God's beloved ones in Rome, called to be saints _and_ designated for a consecrated life: Grace _and_ spiritual blessing and peace be yours from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ. 













###### 8 






First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because [the report of] your faith is made known to all the world _and_ is [^b]commended everywhere. 













###### 9 






For God is my witness, Whom I serve with my [whole] spirit [rendering priestly and spiritual service] in [preaching] the Gospel _and_ [telling] the good news of His Son, how incessantly I always mention you when at my prayers. 













###### 10 






I keep pleading that somehow by God's will I may now at last prosper _and_ come to you. 













###### 11 






For I am yearning to see you, that I may impart _and_ share with you some spiritual gift to strengthen _and_ establish you; 













###### 12 






That is, that we may be mutually strengthened _and_ encouraged _and_ comforted by each other's faith, both yours and mine. 













###### 13 






I want you to know, brethren, that many times I have planned _and_ intended to come to you, though thus far I have been hindered _and_ prevented, in order that I might have some fruit (some result of my labors) among you, as I have among the rest of the Gentiles. 













###### 14 






Both to Greeks and to barbarians (to the cultured and to the uncultured), both to the wise and the foolish, I have an obligation to discharge _and_ a duty to perform _and_ a debt to pay. 













###### 15 






So, for my part, I am willing _and_ eagerly ready to preach the Gospel to you also who are in Rome. 













###### 16 






For I am not ashamed of the Gospel (good news) _of Christ_, for it is God's power working unto salvation [for deliverance from eternal death] to everyone who believes _with_ a personal trust _and_ a confident surrender _and_ firm reliance, to the Jew first and also to the Greek, 













###### 17 






For in the Gospel a righteousness which God ascribes is revealed, both springing from faith and leading to faith [disclosed through the way of faith that arouses to more faith]. As it is written, The man who through faith is just _and_ upright shall live _and_ shall live by faith. 













###### 18 






For God's [holy] wrath _and_ indignation are revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who in their wickedness repress _and_ hinder the truth _and_ make it inoperative. 













###### 19 






For that which is known about God is evident to them _and_ made plain in their inner consciousness, because God [Himself] has shown it to them. 













###### 20 






For ever since the creation of the world His invisible nature _and_ attributes, that is, His eternal power and divinity, have been made intelligible _and_ clearly discernible in _and_ through the things that have been made (His handiworks). So [men] are without excuse [altogether without any defense or justification], 













###### 21 






Because when they knew _and_ recognized Him as God, they did not honor _and_ glorify Him as God or give Him thanks. But instead they became futile _and_ [^c]godless in their thinking [with vain imaginings, foolish reasoning, and stupid speculations] and their senseless minds were darkened. 













###### 22 






Claiming to be wise, they became fools [professing to be smart, they made simpletons of themselves]. 













###### 23 






And by them the glory and majesty _and_ excellence of the immortal God were exchanged for _and_ represented by images, resembling mortal man and birds and beasts and reptiles. 













###### 24 






Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their [own] hearts to sexual impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves [abandoning them to the degrading power of sin], 













###### 25 






Because they exchanged the truth of God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, Who is blessed forever! Amen (so be it). 













###### 26 






For this reason God gave them over _and_ abandoned them to vile affections _and_ degrading passions. For their women exchanged their natural function for an unnatural _and_ abnormal one, 













###### 27 






And the men also turned from natural relations with women and were set ablaze (burning out, consumed) with lust for one another--men committing shameful acts with men and suffering in their own [^d]bodies _and_ personalities the inevitable consequences _and_ penalty of their wrong-doing _and_ going astray, which was [their] fitting retribution. 













###### 28 






And so, since they did not see fit to acknowledge God _or_ approve of Him _or_ consider Him worth the knowing, God gave them over to a base _and_ condemned mind to do things not proper _or_ decent _but_ loathsome, 













###### 29 






Until they were filled (permeated and saturated) with every kind of unrighteousness, iniquity, grasping _and_ covetous greed, and malice. [They were] full of envy _and_ jealousy, murder, strife, deceit _and_ treachery, ill will _and_ cruel ways. [They were] secret backbiters _and_ gossipers, 













###### 30 






Slanderers, hateful to _and_ hating God, full of insolence, arrogance, [and] boasting; inventors of new forms of evil, disobedient _and_ undutiful to parents. 













###### 31 






[They were] without understanding, conscienceless _and_ faithless, heartless _and_ loveless [and] merciless. 













###### 32 






Though they are fully aware of God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve to die, they not only do them themselves but approve _and_ applaud others who practice them.

# Romans 5

***














###### 1 






Therefore, since we are justified ([^a]acquitted, declared righteous, and given a right standing with God) through faith, let us [grasp the fact that we] have [the peace of reconciliation to hold and to [^b]enjoy] peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One). 













###### 2 






Through Him also we have [our] access (entrance, introduction) by faith into this grace (state of God's favor) in which we [firmly and safely] stand. And let us rejoice _and_ exult in our hope of experiencing _and_ enjoying the glory of God. 













###### 3 






Moreover [let us also be full of joy now!] let us exult _and_ triumph in our troubles _and_ rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that pressure _and_ affliction _and_ hardship produce patient _and_ unswerving endurance. 













###### 4 






And endurance (fortitude) develops maturity of [^c]character (approved faith and [^d]tried integrity). And character [of this sort] produces [the habit of] [^e]joyful and confident hope of eternal salvation. 













###### 5 






Such hope never disappoints _or_ deludes _or_ shames us, for God's love has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit Who has been given to us. 













###### 6 






While we were yet in weakness [powerless to help ourselves], at the fitting time Christ died for (in behalf of) the ungodly. 













###### 7 






Now it is an extraordinary thing for one to give his life even for an upright man, though perhaps for a noble _and_ lovable _and_ generous benefactor someone might even dare to die. 













###### 8 






But God shows _and_ clearly proves His [own] love for us by the fact that while we were still sinners, Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One) died for us. 













###### 9 






Therefore, since we are now justified ([^f]acquitted, made righteous, and brought into right relationship with God) by Christ's blood, how much more [certain is it that] we shall be saved by Him from the indignation _and_ wrath of God. 













###### 10 






For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, it is much more [certain], now that we are reconciled, that we shall be saved (daily delivered from sin's dominion) through His [[^g]resurrection] life. 













###### 11 






Not only so, but we also rejoice _and_ exultingly glory in God [in His love and perfection] through our Lord Jesus Christ, through Whom we have now received _and_ enjoy [our] reconciliation. 













###### 12 






Therefore, as sin came into the world through one man, and death as the result of sin, so death spread to all men, [[^h]no one being able to stop it or to escape its power] because all men sinned. 













###### 13 






[To be sure] sin was in the world before ever the Law was given, but sin is not charged to men's account where there is no law [to transgress]. 













###### 14 






Yet death held sway from Adam to Moses [the Lawgiver], even over those who did not themselves transgress [a positive command] as Adam did. Adam was a type (prefigure) of the One Who was to come [in reverse, [^i]the former destructive, the Latter saving]. 













###### 15 






But God's free gift is not at all to be compared to the trespass [His grace is out of all proportion to the fall of man]. For if many died through one man's falling away (his lapse, his offense), much more profusely did God's grace and the free gift [that comes] through the undeserved favor of the one Man Jesus Christ abound _and_ overflow to _and_ for [the benefit of] many. 













###### 16 






Nor is the free gift at all to be compared to the effect of that one [man's] sin. For the sentence [following the trespass] of one [man] brought condemnation, whereas the free gift [following] many transgressions brings justification ([^j]an act of righteousness). 













###### 17 






For if because of one man's trespass (lapse, offense) death reigned through that one, much more surely will those who receive [God's] overflowing grace (unmerited favor) and the free gift of righteousness [putting them into right standing with Himself] reign as kings in life through the one Man Jesus Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One). 













###### 18 






Well then, as one man's trespass [one man's false step and falling away led] to condemnation for all men, so one Man's act of righteousness [leads] to acquittal _and_ right standing with God and life for all men. 













###### 19 






For just as by one man's disobedience (failing to hear, [^k]heedlessness, and carelessness) the many were constituted sinners, so by one Man's obedience the many will be constituted righteous (made acceptable to God, brought into right standing with Him). 













###### 20 






But then Law came in, [only] to expand _and_ increase the trespass [making it more apparent and exciting opposition]. But where sin increased _and_ abounded, grace (God's unmerited favor) has surpassed it _and_ increased the more _and_ superabounded, 













###### 21 






So that, [just] as sin has reigned in death, [so] grace (His unearned and undeserved favor) might reign also through righteousness (right standing with God) which issues in eternal life through Jesus Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One) our Lord.

# Titus 1

***














###### 1 






Paul, a bond servant of God and an apostle (a special messenger) of Jesus Christ (the Messiah) to stimulate _and_ promote the faith of God's chosen ones and to lead them on to accurate discernment _and_ recognition of _and_ acquaintance with the Truth which belongs to _and_ harmonizes with _and_ tends to godliness, 













###### 2 






[Resting] in the hope of eternal life, [life] which the ever truthful God Who cannot deceive promised before the world _or_ the ages of time began. 













###### 3 






And [now] in His own appointed time He has made manifest (made known) His Word _and_ revealed it as His message through the preaching entrusted to me by command of God our Savior; 













###### 4 






To Titus, my true child according to a common (general) faith: Grace (favor and spiritual blessing) and [heart] peace from God the Father and _the Lord_ Christ Jesus our Savior. 













###### 5 






For this reason I left you [behind] in Crete, that you might set right what was defective _and_ finish what was left undone, and that you might appoint elders _and_ set them over the churches (assemblies) in every city as I directed you. 













###### 6 






[These elders should be] men who are of unquestionable integrity _and_ are irreproachable, the husband of [but] one wife, whose children are [well trained and are] believers, not open to the accusation of being loose in morals _and_ conduct or unruly _and_ disorderly. 













###### 7 






For the bishop (an overseer) as God's steward must be blameless, not self-willed _or_ arrogant _or_ presumptuous; he must not be quick-tempered or given to drink _or_ pugnacious (brawling, violent); he must not be grasping _and_ greedy for filthy lucre (financial gain); 













###### 8 






But he must be hospitable (loving and a friend to believers, especially to strangers and foreigners); [he must be] a lover of goodness [of good people and good things], sober-minded (sensible, discreet), upright _and_ fair-minded, a devout man _and_ religiously correct, temperate _and_ keeping himself in hand. 













###### 9 






He must hold fast to the sure _and_ trustworthy Word of God as he was taught it, so that he may be able both to give stimulating instruction _and_ encouragement in sound (wholesome) doctrine and to refute _and_ convict those who contradict _and_ oppose it [showing the wayward their error]. 













###### 10 






For there are many disorderly _and_ unruly men who are idle (vain, empty) _and_ misleading talkers and self-deceivers _and_ deceivers of others. [This is true] especially of those of the circumcision party [who have come over from Judaism]. 













###### 11 






Their mouths must be stopped, for they are mentally distressing _and_ subverting whole families by teaching what they ought not to teach, for the purpose of getting base advantage _and_ disreputable gain. 













###### 12 






One of their [very] number, a prophet of their own, said, Cretans are always liars, hurtful beasts, idle _and_ lazy gluttons. 













###### 13 






And this account of them is [really] true. Because it is [true], rebuke them sharply [deal sternly, even severely with them], so that they may be sound in the faith _and_ free from error, 













###### 14 






[And may show their soundness by] ceasing to give attention to Jewish myths _and_ fables or to rules [laid down] by [mere] men who reject _and_ turn their backs on the Truth. 













###### 15 






To the pure [in heart and conscience] all things are pure, but to the defiled _and_ corrupt and unbelieving nothing is pure; their very minds and consciences are defiled _and_ polluted. 













###### 16 






They profess to know God [to recognize, perceive, and be acquainted with Him], but deny _and_ disown _and_ renounce Him by what they do; they are detestable _and_ loathsome, unbelieving _and_ disobedient _and_ disloyal _and_ rebellious, and [they are] unfit _and_ worthless for good work (deed or enterprise) of any kind.

# Titus 2

***


###### 1 


But [as for] you, teach what is fitting _and_ becoming to sound (wholesome) doctrine [the character and right living that identify true Christians]. 


###### 2 


Urge the older men to be temperate, venerable (serious), sensible, self-controlled, and sound in the faith, in the love, and in the steadfastness _and_ patience [of Christ]. 


###### 3 


Bid the older women similarly to be reverent _and_ devout in their deportment as becomes those engaged in sacred service, not slanderers or slaves to drink. They are to give good counsel _and_ be teachers of what is right _and_ noble, 


###### 4 


So that they will wisely train the young women to be sane and sober of mind (temperate, disciplined) and to love their husbands and their children, 


###### 5 


To be self-controlled, chaste, homemakers, good-natured (kindhearted), adapting _and_ subordinating themselves to their husbands, that the word of God may not be exposed to reproach (blasphemed or discredited). 


###### 6 


In a similar way, urge the younger men to be self-restrained _and_ to behave prudently [taking life seriously]. 


###### 7 


And show your own self in all respects to be a pattern _and_ a model of good deeds _and_ works, teaching what is unadulterated, showing gravity [having the strictest regard for truth and purity of motive], with dignity _and_ seriousness. 


###### 8 


And let your instruction be sound _and_ fit _and_ wise _and_ wholesome, vigorous _and_ irrefutable _and_ above censure, so that the opponent may be put to shame, finding nothing discrediting _or_ evil to say about us. 


###### 9 


[Tell] bond servants to be submissive to their masters, to be pleasing _and_ give satisfaction in every way. [Warn them] not to talk back _or_ contradict, 


###### 10 


Nor to steal by taking things of small value, but to prove themselves truly loyal _and_ entirely reliable _and_ faithful throughout, so that in everything they may be an ornament _and_ do credit to the teaching [which is] from _and_ about God our Savior. 


###### 11 


For the grace of God (His unmerited favor and blessing) has come forward (appeared) for the deliverance from sin _and_ the eternal salvation for all mankind. 


###### 12 


It has trained us to reject _and_ renounce all ungodliness (irreligion) and worldly (passionate) desires, to live discreet (temperate, self-controlled), upright, devout (spiritually whole) lives in this present world, 


###### 13 


Awaiting _and_ looking for the [fulfillment, the realization of our] blessed hope, even the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Christ Jesus (the Messiah, the Anointed One), 


###### 14 


Who gave Himself on our behalf that He might redeem us (purchase our freedom) from all iniquity and purify for Himself a people [to be peculiarly His own, people who are] eager _and_ enthusiastic about [living a life that is good and filled with] beneficial deeds. 


###### 15 


Tell [them all] these things. Urge (advise, encourage, warn) and rebuke with full authority. Let no one despise _or_ disregard _or_ think little of you [conduct yourself and your teaching so as to command respect].

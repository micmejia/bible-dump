# Titus 3

***














###### 1 






Remind people to be submissive to [their] magistrates and authorities, to be obedient, to be prepared _and_ willing to do any upright _and_ honorable work, 













###### 2 






To slander _or_ abuse _or_ speak evil of no one, to avoid being contentious, to be forbearing (yielding, gentle, and conciliatory), and to show unqualified courtesy toward everybody. 













###### 3 






For we also were once thoughtless _and_ senseless, obstinate _and_ disobedient, deluded _and_ misled; [we too were once] slaves to all sorts of cravings _and_ pleasures, wasting our days in malice and jealousy _and_ envy, hateful (hated, detestable) and hating one another. 













###### 4 






But when the goodness and loving-kindness of God our Savior to man [as man] appeared, 













###### 5 






He saved us, not because of any works of righteousness that we had done, but because of His own pity _and_ mercy, by [the] cleansing [bath] of the new birth (regeneration) and renewing of the Holy Spirit, 













###### 6 






Which He poured out [so] richly upon us through Jesus Christ our Savior. 













###### 7 






[And He did it in order] that we might be justified by His grace (by His favor, wholly undeserved), [that we might be acknowledged and counted as conformed to the divine will in purpose, thought, and action], and that we might become heirs of eternal life according to [our] hope. 













###### 8 






This message is most trustworthy, and concerning these things I want you to insist steadfastly, so that those who have believed in (trusted in, relied on) God may be careful to apply themselves to honorable occupations _and_ to doing good, for such things are [not only] excellent _and_ right [in themselves], but [they are] good _and_ profitable for the people. 













###### 9 






But avoid stupid _and_ foolish controversies and genealogies and dissensions and wrangling about the Law, for they are unprofitable and futile. 













###### 10 






[As for] a man who is factious [a heretical sectarian and cause of divisions], after admonishing him a first and second time, reject [him from your fellowship and have nothing more to do with him], 













###### 11 






Well aware that such a person has utterly changed (is perverted and corrupted); he goes on sinning [though he] is convicted of guilt _and_ self-condemned. 













###### 12 






When I send Artemas or [perhaps] Tychicus to you, lose no time _but_ make every effort to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there. 













###### 13 






Do your utmost to speed Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way; see that they want for (lack) nothing. 













###### 14 






And let our own [people really] learn to apply themselves to good deeds (to honest labor and honorable employment), so that they may be able to meet necessary demands [^a]whenever the occasion may require and not be living idle _and_ uncultivated _and_ unfruitful lives. 













###### 15 






All who are with me wish to be remembered to you. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace (God's favor and blessing) be with you all. _Amen (so be it)._ ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

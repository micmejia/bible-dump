# Zechariah 6

***














###### 1 






And again I lifted up my eyes and saw, and behold, four chariots came out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of firm, immovable bronze. 













###### 2 






The first chariot had red _or_ bay horses, the second chariot had black horses, 













###### 3 






The third chariot had white horses, and the fourth chariot had dappled, active, _and_ strong horses. 













###### 4 






Then I said to the angel who talked with me, What are these, my lord? 













###### 5 






And the angel answered me, These are the four winds _or_ spirits of the heavens, which go forth from presenting themselves before the Lord of all the earth. 













###### 6 






The chariot with the black horses is going forth into the north country, and the white ones are going forth after them [because there are two northern powers to overcome], and the dappled ones are going forth toward the south country. 













###### 7 






And [the chariots with] the strong [horses] went forth and sought to go that they might patrol the earth. And [the Lord] said to them, Go, walk to and fro through the earth _and_ patrol it. So they walked about through the earth [watching and protecting it]. 













###### 8 






Then He summoned me and said to me, Behold, these that go toward the north country have quieted My Spirit [of wrath] _and_ have caused it to rest in the north country. 













###### 9 






And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, 













###### 10 






Accept donations _and_ offerings from these [as representatives of the] exiles, from Heldai, from Tobijah, and from Jedaiah, who have come from Babylon; and come the same day and go to the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah. 













###### 11 






Yes, take from them silver and gold, and make crowns and set [one] upon the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, 













###### 12 






And say to him, Thus says the Lord of hosts: [You, Joshua] behold (look at, keep in sight, watch) the Man [the Messiah] whose name is the Branch, for He shall grow up in His place and He shall build the [true] temple of the Lord. 













###### 13 






Yes, [you are building a temple of the Lord, but] it is He Who shall build the [true] temple of the Lord, and He shall bear the honor _and_ glory [as of the only begotten of the Father] and shall sit and rule upon His throne. And He shall be a [^a]Priest upon His throne, and the counsel of peace shall be between the two [offices--Priest and King]. 













###### 14 






And the [other] crown shall be [credited] to Helem (Heldai), to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to the kindness _and_ favor of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, and shall be in the temple of the Lord for a reminder _and_ memorial. 













###### 15 






And those who are far off shall come and help build the temple of the Lord, and you shall know (recognize and understand) that the Lord sent me [Zechariah] to you. And [your part in this] shall come to pass if you will diligently obey the voice of the Lord your God.

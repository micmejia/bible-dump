# 1 Chronicles 18

***


###### 1 
After this it came to pass that David attacked the Philistines, subdued them, and took Gath and its towns from the hand of the Philistines. 

###### 2 
Then he defeated Moab, and the Moabites became David's servants, _and_ brought tribute. 

###### 3 
And David defeated Hadadezer king of Zobah _as far as_ Hamath, as he went to establish his power by the River Euphrates. 

###### 4 
David took from him one thousand chariots, seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand foot soldiers. Also David hamstrung all the chariot _horses,_ except that he spared enough of them for one hundred chariots. 

###### 5 
When the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David killed twenty-two thousand of the Syrians. 

###### 6 
Then David put _garrisons_ in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became David's servants, _and_ brought tribute. So the Lord preserved David wherever he went. 

###### 7 
And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. 

###### 8 
Also from Tibhath and from Chun, cities of Hadadezer, David brought a large amount of bronze, with which Solomon made the bronze Sea, the pillars, and the articles of bronze. 

###### 9 
Now when Tou king of Hamath heard that David had defeated all the army of Hadadezer king of Zobah, 

###### 10 
he sent Hadoram his son to King David, to greet him and bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and defeated him (for Hadadezer had been at war with Tou); and _Hadoram brought with him_ all kinds of articles of gold, silver, and bronze. 

###### 11 
King David also dedicated these to the Lord, along with the silver and gold that he had brought from all _these_ nations--from Edom, from Moab, from the people of Ammon, from the Philistines, and from Amalek. 

###### 12 
Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah killed eighteen thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt. 

###### 13 
He also put garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became David's servants. And the Lord preserved David wherever he went.

## David's Administration 

###### 14 
So David reigned over all Israel, and administered judgment and justice to all his people. 

###### 15 
Joab the son of Zeruiah _was_ over the army; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud _was_ recorder; 

###### 16 
Zadok the son of Ahitub and Abimelech the son of Abiathar _were_ the priests; Shavsha _was_ the scribe; 

###### 17 
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada _was_ over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons _were_ chief ministers at the king's side.

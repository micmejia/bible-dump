***


###### 1 
The sons of Judah _were_ Perez, Hezron, Carmi, Hur, and Shobal. 

###### 2 
And Reaiah the son of Shobal begot Jahath, and Jahath begot Ahumai and Lahad. These _were_ the families of the Zorathites. 

###### 3 
These _were the sons of_ the father of Etam: Jezreel, Ishma, and Idbash; and the name of their sister _was_ Hazelelponi; 

###### 4 
and Penuel _was_ the father of Gedor, and Ezer _was the_ father of Hushah. These _were_ the sons of Hur, the firstborn of Ephrathah the father of Bethlehem. 

###### 5 
And Ashhur the father of Tekoa had two wives, Helah and Naarah. 

###### 6 
Naarah bore him Ahuzzam, Hepher, Temeni, and Haahashtari. These _were_ the sons of Naarah. 

###### 7 
The sons of Helah _were_ Zereth, Zohar, and Ethnan; 

###### 8 
and Koz begot Anub, Zobebah, and the families of Aharhel the son of Harum. 

###### 9 
Now Jabez was more honorable than his brothers, and his mother called his name Jabez, saying, "Because I bore _him_ in pain." 

###### 10 
And Jabez called on the God of Israel saying, "Oh, that You would bless me indeed, and enlarge my territory, that Your hand would be with me, and that You would keep _me_ from evil, that I may not cause pain!" So God granted him what he requested. 

###### 11 
Chelub the brother of Shuhah begot Mehir, who _was_ the father of Eshton. 

###### 12 
And Eshton begot Beth-Rapha, Paseah, and Tehinnah the father of Ir-Nahash. These _were_ the men of Rechah. 

###### 13 
The sons of Kenaz _were_ Othniel and Seraiah. The sons of Othniel _were_ Hathath, 

###### 14 
and Meonothai _who_ begot Ophrah. Seraiah begot Joab the father of Ge Harashim, for they were craftsmen. 

###### 15 
The sons of Caleb the son of Jephunneh _were_ Iru, Elah, and Naam. The son of Elah _was_ Kenaz. 

###### 16 
The sons of Jehallelel _were_ Ziph, Ziphah, Tiria, and Asarel. 

###### 17 
The sons of Ezrah _were_ Jether, Mered, Epher, and Jalon. And _Mered's wife_ bore Miriam, Shammai, and Ishbah the father of Eshtemoa. 

###### 18 
(His wife Jehudijah bore Jered the father of Gedor, Heber the father of Sochoh, and Jekuthiel the father of Zanoah.) And these were the sons of Bithiah the daughter of Pharaoh, whom Mered took. 

###### 19 
The sons of Hodiah's wife, the sister of Naham, _were_ the fathers of Keilah the Garmite and of Eshtemoa the Maachathite. 

###### 20 
And the sons of Shimon _were_ Amnon, Rinnah, Ben-Hanan, and Tilon. And the sons of Ishi _were_ Zoheth and Ben-Zoheth. 

###### 21 
The sons of Shelah the son of Judah _were_ Er the father of Lecah, Laadah the father of Mareshah, and the families of the house of the linen workers of the house of Ashbea; 

###### 22 
also Jokim, the men of Chozeba, and Joash; Saraph, who ruled in Moab, and Jashubi-Lehem. Now the records are ancient. 

###### 23 
These _were_ the potters and those who dwell at Netaim and Gederah; there they dwelt with the king for his work. ## The Family of Simeon 

###### 24 
The sons of Simeon _were_ Nemuel, Jamin, Jarib, Zerah, _and_ Shaul, 

###### 25 
Shallum his son, Mibsam his son, and Mishma his son. 

###### 26 
And the sons of Mishma _were_ Hamuel his son, Zacchur his son, and Shimei his son. 

###### 27 
Shimei had sixteen sons and six daughters; but his brothers did not have many children, nor did any of their families multiply as much as the children of Judah. 

###### 28 
They dwelt at Beersheba, Moladah, Hazar Shual, 

###### 29 
Bilhah, Ezem, Tolad, 

###### 30 
Bethuel, Hormah, Ziklag, 

###### 31 
Beth Marcaboth, Hazar Susim, Beth Biri, and at Shaaraim. These _were_ their cities until the reign of David. 

###### 32 
And their villages _were_ Etam, Ain, Rimmon, Tochen, and Ashan--five cities-- 

###### 33 
and all the villages that _were_ around these cities as far as Baal. These _were_ their dwelling places, and they maintained their genealogy: 

###### 34 
Meshobab, Jamlech, and Joshah the son of Amaziah; 

###### 35 
Joel, and Jehu the son of Joshibiah, the son of Seraiah, the son of Asiel; 

###### 36 
Elioenai, Jaakobah, Jeshohaiah, Asaiah, Adiel, Jesimiel, and Benaiah; 

###### 37 
Ziza the son of Shiphi, the son of Allon, the son of Jedaiah, the son of Shimri, the son of Shemaiah-- 

###### 38 
these mentioned by name _were_ leaders in their families, and their father's house increased greatly. 

###### 39 
So they went to the entrance of Gedor, as far as the east side of the valley, to seek pasture for their flocks. 

###### 40 
And they found rich, good pasture, and the land _was_ broad, quiet, and peaceful; for some Hamites formerly lived there. 

###### 41 
These recorded by name came in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah; and they attacked their tents and the Meunites who were found there, and utterly destroyed them, as it is to this day. So they dwelt in their place, because _there was_ pasture for their flocks there. 

###### 42 
Now _some_ of them, five hundred men of the sons of Simeon, went to Mount Seir, having as their captains Pelatiah, Neariah, Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi. 

###### 43 
And they defeated the rest of the Amalekites who had escaped. They have dwelt there to this day.

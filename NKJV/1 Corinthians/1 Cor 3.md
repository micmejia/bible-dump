# 1 Corinthians 3

***


###### 1 
And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual _people_ but as to carnal, as to babes in Christ. 

###### 2 
I fed you with milk and not with solid food; for until now you were not able _to receive it,_ and even now you are still not able; 

###### 3 
for you are still carnal. For where _there are_ envy, strife, and divisions among you, are you not carnal and [^a]behaving like _mere_ men? 

###### 4 
For when one says, "I am of Paul," and another, "I _am_ of Apollos," are you not carnal? ## Watering, Working, Warning 

###### 5 
Who then is Paul, and who _is_ Apollos, but ministers through whom you believed, as the Lord gave to each one? 

###### 6 
I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase. 

###### 7 
So then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase. 

###### 8 
Now he who plants and he who waters are one, and each one will receive his own reward according to his own labor. 

###### 9 
For we are God's fellow workers; you are God's field, _you are_ God's building. 

###### 10 
According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation, and another builds on it. But let each one take heed how he builds on it. 

###### 11 
For no other foundation can anyone lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. 

###### 12 
Now if anyone builds on this foundation _with_ gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, 

###### 13 
each one's work will become clear; for the Day will declare it, because it will be revealed by fire; and the fire will test each one's work, of what sort it is. 

###### 14 
If anyone's work which he has built on _it_ endures, he will receive a reward. 

###### 15 
If anyone's work is burned, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire. 

###### 16 
Do you not know that you are the temple of God and _that_ the Spirit of God dwells in you? 

###### 17 
If anyone [^b]defiles the temple of God, God will destroy him. For the temple of God is holy, which _temple_ you are. ## Avoid Worldly Wisdom 

###### 18 
Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you seems to be wise in this age, let him become a fool that he may become wise. 

###### 19 
For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, "He catches the wise in their _own_ craftiness"; 

###### 20 
and again, "The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are futile." 

###### 21 
Therefore let no one boast in men. For all things are yours: 

###### 22 
whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas, or the world or life or death, or things present or things to come--all are yours. 

###### 23 
And you _are_ Christ's, and Christ _is_ God's.

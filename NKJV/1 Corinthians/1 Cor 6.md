# 1 Corinthians 6

***


###### 1 
Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the saints? 

###### 2 
Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world will be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters? 

###### 3 
Do you not know that we shall judge angels? How much more, things that pertain to this life? 

###### 4 
If then you have [^a]judgments concerning things pertaining to this life, do you appoint those who are least esteemed by the church to judge? 

###### 5 
I say this to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you, not even one, who will be able to judge between his brethren? 

###### 6 
But brother goes to law against brother, and that before unbelievers! 

###### 7 
Now therefore, it is already an utter failure for you that you go to law against one another. Why do you not rather accept wrong? Why do you not rather _let yourselves_ be cheated? 

###### 8 
No, you yourselves do wrong and cheat, and _you do_ these things _to your_ brethren! 

###### 9 
Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor [^b]homosexuals, nor [^c]sodomites, 

###### 10 
nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God. 

###### 11 
And such were some of you. But you were washed, but you were [^d]sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God. ## Glorify God in Body and Spirit 

###### 12 
All things are lawful for me, but all things are not [^e]helpful. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of [^f]any. 

###### 13 
Foods for the stomach and the stomach for foods, but God will destroy both it and them. Now the body _is_ not for sexual immorality but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. 

###### 14 
And God both raised up the Lord and will also raise us up by His power. 

###### 15 
Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make _them_ members of a harlot? Certainly not! 

###### 16 
Or do you not know that he who is joined to a harlot is one body _with her?_ For "the two," He says, "shall become one flesh." 

###### 17 
But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit _with Him._ 

###### 18 
Flee sexual immorality. Every sin that a man does is outside the body, but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body. 

###### 19 
Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit _who is_ in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own? 

###### 20 
For you were bought at a price; therefore glorify God in your body [^g]and in your spirit, which are God's. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

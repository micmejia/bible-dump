# 1 Corinthians 8

***


###### 1 
Now concerning things offered to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge [^a]puffs up, but love [^b]edifies. 

###### 2 
And if anyone thinks that he knows anything, he knows nothing yet as he ought to know. 

###### 3 
But if anyone loves God, this one is known by Him. 

###### 4 
Therefore concerning the eating of things offered to idols, we know that an idol _is_ nothing in the world, and that _there is_ no other God but one. 

###### 5 
For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as there are many gods and many lords), 

###### 6 
yet for us _there is_ one God, the Father, of whom _are_ all things, and we for Him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom _are_ all things, and through whom we _live._ 

###### 7 
However, _there is_ not in everyone that knowledge; for some, with consciousness of the idol, until now eat _it_ as a thing offered to an idol; and their conscience, being weak, is defiled. 

###### 8 
But food does not commend us to God; for neither if we eat are we the better, nor if we do not eat are we the worse. 

###### 9 
But beware lest somehow this liberty of yours become a [^c]stumbling block to those who are weak. 

###### 10 
For if anyone sees you who have knowledge eating in an idol's temple, will not the conscience of him who is weak be emboldened to eat those things offered to idols? 

###### 11 
And because of your knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died? 

###### 12 
But when you thus sin against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ. 

###### 13 
Therefore, if food makes my brother stumble, I will never again eat meat, lest I make my brother stumble. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# 1 Kings 4

***


###### 1 
So King Solomon was king over all Israel. 

###### 2 
And these _were_ his officials: Azariah the son of Zadok, the priest; 

###### 3 
Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder; 

###### 4 
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, over the army; Zadok and Abiathar, the priests; 

###### 5 
Azariah the son of Nathan, over the officers; Zabud the son of Nathan, a priest _and_ the king's friend; 

###### 6 
Ahishar, over the household; and Adoniram the son of Abda, over the labor force. 

###### 7 
And Solomon had twelve governors over all Israel, who provided food for the king and his household; each one made provision for one month of the year. 

###### 8 
These _are_ their names: Ben-Hur, in the mountains of Ephraim; 

###### 9 
Ben-Deker, in Makaz, Shaalbim, Beth Shemesh, and Elon Beth Hanan; 

###### 10 
Ben-Hesed, in Arubboth; to him _belonged_ Sochoh and all the land of Hepher; 

###### 11 
Ben-Abinadab, _in_ all the regions of Dor; he had Taphath the daughter of Solomon as wife; 

###### 12 
Baana the son of Ahilud, _in_ Taanach, Megiddo, and all Beth Shean, which _is_ beside Zaretan below Jezreel, from Beth Shean to Abel Meholah, as far as the other side of Jokneam; 

###### 13 
Ben-Geber, in Ramoth Gilead; to him _belonged_ the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, in Gilead; to him _also belonged_ the region of Argob in Bashan--sixty large cities with walls and bronze gate-bars; 

###### 14 
Ahinadab the son of Iddo, _in_ Mahanaim; 

###### 15 
Ahimaaz, in Naphtali; he also took Basemath the daughter of Solomon as wife; 

###### 16 
Baanah the son of Hushai, in Asher and Aloth; 

###### 17 
Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar; 

###### 18 
Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin; 

###### 19 
Geber the son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, _in_ the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan. _He was_ the only governor who _was_ in the land.

## Prosperity and Wisdom of Solomon's Reign 

###### 20 
Judah and Israel _were_ as numerous as the sand by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking and rejoicing. 

###### 21 
So Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the River _to_ the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Egypt. _They_ brought tribute and served Solomon all the days of his life. 

###### 22 
Now Solomon's provision for one day was thirty kors of fine flour, sixty kors of meal, 

###### 23 
ten fatted oxen, twenty oxen from the pastures, and one hundred sheep, besides deer, gazelles, roebucks, and fatted fowl. 

###### 24 
For he had dominion over all _the region_ on this side of the River from Tiphsah even to Gaza, namely over all the kings on this side of the River; and he had peace on every side all around him. 

###### 25 
And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, each man under his vine and his fig tree, from Dan as far as Beersheba, all the days of Solomon. 

###### 26 
Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. 

###### 27 
And these governors, each man in his month, provided food for King Solomon and for all who came to King Solomon's table. There was no lack in their supply. 

###### 28 
They also brought barley and straw to the proper place, for the horses and steeds, each man according to his charge. 

###### 29 
And God gave Solomon wisdom and exceedingly great understanding, and largeness of heart like the sand on the seashore. 

###### 30 
Thus Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the men of the East and all the wisdom of Egypt. 

###### 31 
For he was wiser than all men--than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol; and his fame was in all the surrounding nations. 

###### 32 
He spoke three thousand proverbs, and his songs were one thousand and five. 

###### 33 
Also he spoke of trees, from the cedar tree of Lebanon even to the hyssop that springs out of the wall; he spoke also of animals, of birds, of creeping things, and of fish. 

###### 34 
And men of all nations, from all the kings of the earth who had heard of his wisdom, came to hear the wisdom of Solomon.

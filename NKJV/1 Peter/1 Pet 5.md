# 1 Peter 5

***


###### 1 
The elders who are among you I exhort, I who am a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that will be revealed: 

###### 2 
Shepherd the flock of God which is among you, serving as overseers, not by compulsion but [^a]willingly, not for dishonest gain but eagerly; 

###### 3 
nor as being [^b]lords over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock; 

###### 4 
and when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that does not fade away. ## Submit to God, Resist the Devil 

###### 5 
Likewise you younger people, submit yourselves to _your_ elders. Yes, all of _you_ be submissive to one another, and be clothed with humility, for "God resists the proud, But gives grace to the humble." 

###### 6 
Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time, 

###### 7 
casting all your care upon Him, for He cares for you. 

###### 8 
Be [^c]sober, be [^d]vigilant; [^e]because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. 

###### 9 
Resist him, steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same sufferings are experienced by your brotherhood in the world. 

###### 10 
But [^f]may the God of all grace, who called [^g]us to His eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a while, [^h]perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle _you._ 

###### 11 
To Him _be_ the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen. ## Farewell and Peace 

###### 12 
By Silvanus, our faithful brother as I consider him, I have written to you briefly, exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God in which you stand. 

###### 13 
She who is in Babylon, elect together with _you,_ greets you; and _so does_ Mark my son. 

###### 14 
Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace to you all who are in Christ Jesus. Amen. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

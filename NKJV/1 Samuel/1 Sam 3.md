# 1 Samuel 3

***


###### 1 
Now the boy Samuel ministered to the Lord before Eli. And the word of the Lord was rare in those days; _there was_ no widespread revelation. 

###### 2 
And it came to pass at that time, while Eli _was_ lying down in his place, and when his eyes had begun to grow so dim that he could not see, 

###### 3 
and before the lamp of God went out in the [^a]tabernacle of the Lord where the ark of God _was,_ and while Samuel was lying down, 

###### 4 
that the Lord called Samuel. And he answered, "Here I am!" 

###### 5 
So he ran to Eli and said, "Here I am, for you called me." And he said, "I did not call; lie down again." And he went and lay down. 

###### 6 
Then the Lord called yet again, "Samuel!" So Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, "Here I am, for you called me." He answered, "I did not call, my son; lie down again." 

###### 7 
(Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord, nor was the word of the Lord yet revealed to him.) 

###### 8 
And the Lord called Samuel again the third time. So he arose and went to Eli, and said, "Here I am, for you did call me." Then Eli perceived that the Lord had called the boy. 

###### 9 
Therefore Eli said to Samuel, "Go, lie down; and it shall be, if He calls you, that you must say, 'Speak, Lord, for Your servant hears.' " So Samuel went and lay down in his place. 

###### 10 
Now the Lord came and stood and called as at other times, "Samuel! Samuel!" And Samuel answered, "Speak, for Your servant hears." 

###### 11 
Then the Lord said to Samuel: "Behold, I will do something in Israel at which both ears of everyone who hears it will tingle. 

###### 12 
In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from beginning to end. 

###### 13 
For I have told him that I will judge his house forever for the iniquity which he knows, because his sons made themselves vile, and he did not [^b]restrain them. 

###### 14 
And therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be atoned for by sacrifice or offering forever." 

###### 15 
So Samuel lay down until [^c]morning, and opened the doors of the house of the Lord. And Samuel was afraid to tell Eli the vision. 

###### 16 
Then Eli called Samuel and said, "Samuel, my son!" He answered, "Here I am." 

###### 17 
And he said, "What _is_ the word that _the Lord_ spoke to you? Please do not hide _it_ from me. God do so to you, and more also, if you hide anything from me of all the things that He said to you." 

###### 18 
Then Samuel told him everything, and hid nothing from him. And he said, "It _is_ the Lord. Let Him do what seems good to Him." 

###### 19 
So Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him and let none of his words [^d]fall to the ground. 

###### 20 
And all Israel from Dan to Beersheba knew that Samuel _had been_ [^e]established as a prophet of the Lord. 

###### 21 
Then the Lord appeared again in Shiloh. For the Lord revealed Himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the Lord. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

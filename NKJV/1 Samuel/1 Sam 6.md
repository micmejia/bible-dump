# 1 Samuel 6

***


###### 1 
Now the ark of the Lord was in the country of the Philistines seven months. 

###### 2 
And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, "What shall we do with the ark of the Lord? Tell us how we should send it to its place." 

###### 3 
So they said, "If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, do not send it empty; but by all means return _it_ to Him _with_ a trespass offering. Then you will be healed, and it will be known to you why His hand is not removed from you." 

###### 4 
Then they said, "What _is_ the trespass offering which we shall return to Him?" They answered, "Five golden tumors and five golden rats, _according to_ the number of the lords of the Philistines. For the same plague _was_ on all of you and on your lords. 

###### 5 
Therefore you shall make images of your tumors and images of your rats that ravage the land, and you shall give glory to the God of Israel; perhaps He will lighten His hand from you, from your gods, and from your land. 

###### 6 
Why then do you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When He did mighty things among them, did they not let the people go, that they might depart? 

###### 7 
Now therefore, make a new cart, take two milk cows which have never been yoked, and hitch the cows to the cart; and take their calves home, away from them. 

###### 8 
Then take the ark of the Lord and set it on the cart; and put the articles of gold which you are returning to Him _as_ a trespass offering in a chest by its side. Then send it away, and let it go. 

###### 9 
And watch: if it goes up the road to its own territory, to Beth Shemesh, _then_ He has done us this great evil. But if not, then we shall know that _it is_ not His hand _that_ struck us--it happened to us by chance." 

###### 10 
Then the men did so; they took two milk cows and hitched them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home. 

###### 11 
And they set the ark of the Lord on the cart, and the chest with the gold rats and the images of their tumors. 

###### 12 
Then the cows headed straight for the road to Beth Shemesh, _and_ went along the highway, lowing as they went, and did not turn aside to the right hand or the left. And the lords of the Philistines went after them to the border of Beth Shemesh. 

###### 13 
Now _the people of_ Beth Shemesh _were_ reaping their wheat harvest in the valley; and they lifted their eyes and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see _it._ 

###### 14 
Then the cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh, and stood there; a large stone _was_ there. So they split the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the Lord. 

###### 15 
The Levites took down the ark of the Lord and the chest that _was_ with it, in which _were_ the articles of gold, and put _them_ on the large stone. Then the men of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings and made sacrifices the same day to the Lord. 

###### 16 
So when the five lords of the Philistines had seen _it,_ they returned to Ekron the same day. 

###### 17 
These _are_ the golden tumors which the Philistines returned _as_ a trespass offering to the Lord: one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, one for Ekron; 

###### 18 
and the golden rats, _according to_ the number of all the cities of the Philistines _belonging_ to the five lords, _both_ fortified cities and country villages, even as far as the large _stone of_ Abel on which they set the ark of the Lord, _which stone remains_ to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh. 

###### 19 
Then He struck the men of Beth Shemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the Lord. He struck fifty thousand and seventy men of the people, and the people lamented because the Lord had struck the people with a great slaughter.

## The Ark at Kirjath Jearim 

###### 20 
And the men of Beth Shemesh said, "Who is able to stand before this holy Lord God? And to whom shall it go up from us?" 

###### 21 
So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjath Jearim, saying, "The Philistines have brought back the ark of the Lord; come down _and_ take it up with you."

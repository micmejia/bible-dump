# 1 Timothy 1

***


###### 1 
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the commandment of God our Savior and the Lord Jesus Christ, our hope, 

###### 2 
To Timothy, a true son in the faith: Grace, mercy, _and_ peace from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord. ## No Other Doctrine 

###### 3 
As I urged you when I went into Macedonia--remain in Ephesus that you may charge some that they teach no other doctrine, 

###### 4 
nor give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which cause disputes rather than godly edification which is in faith. 

###### 5 
Now the purpose of the commandment is love from a pure heart, _from_ a good conscience, and _from_ sincere faith, 

###### 6 
from which some, having strayed, have turned aside to idle talk, 

###### 7 
desiring to be teachers of the law, understanding neither what they say nor the things which they affirm. 

###### 8 
But we know that the law _is_ good if one uses it lawfully, 

###### 9 
knowing this: that the law is not made for a righteous person, but for _the_ lawless and insubordinate, for _the_ ungodly and for sinners, for _the_ unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, 

###### 10 
for fornicators, for sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine, 

###### 11 
according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God which was committed to my trust. ## Glory to God for His Grace 

###### 12 
And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord who has enabled me, because He counted me faithful, putting _me_ into the ministry, 

###### 13 
although I was formerly a blasphemer, a persecutor, and an insolent man; but I obtained mercy because I did _it_ ignorantly in unbelief. 

###### 14 
And the grace of our Lord was exceedingly abundant, with faith and love which are in Christ Jesus. 

###### 15 
This _is_ a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief. 

###### 16 
However, for this reason I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show all longsuffering, as a pattern to those who are going to believe on Him for everlasting life. 

###### 17 
Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, to God who alone is wise, _be_ honor and glory forever and ever. Amen. ## Fight the Good Fight 

###### 18 
This charge I commit to you, son Timothy, according to the prophecies previously made concerning you, that by them you may wage the good warfare, 

###### 19 
having faith and a good conscience, which some having rejected, concerning the faith have suffered shipwreck, 

###### 20 
of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I delivered to Satan that they may learn not to blaspheme.

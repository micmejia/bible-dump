# 1 Timothy 3

***


###### 1 
This _is_ a faithful saying: If a man desires the position of a [^a]bishop, he desires a good work. 

###### 2 
A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, temperate, sober-minded, of good behavior, hospitable, able to teach; 

###### 3 
not [^b]given to wine, not violent, [^c]not greedy for money, but gentle, not quarrelsome, not [^d]covetous; 

###### 4 
one who rules his own house well, having _his_ children in submission with all reverence 

###### 5 
(for if a man does not know how to rule his own house, how will he take care of the church of God?); 

###### 6 
not a [^e]novice, lest being puffed up with pride he fall into the _same_ condemnation as the devil. 

###### 7 
Moreover he must have a good testimony among those who are outside, lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil. ## Qualifications of Deacons 

###### 8 
Likewise deacons _must be_ reverent, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy for money, 

###### 9 
holding the [^f]mystery of the faith with a pure conscience. 

###### 10 
But let these also first be tested; then let them serve as deacons, being _found_ blameless. 

###### 11 
Likewise, _their_ wives _must be_ reverent, not [^g]slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things. 

###### 12 
Let deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling _their_ children and their own houses well. 

###### 13 
For those who have served well as deacons obtain for themselves a good standing and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus. ## The Great Mystery 

###### 14 
These things I write to you, though I hope to come to you shortly; 

###### 15 
but if I am delayed, _I write_ so that you may know how you ought to conduct yourself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and [^h]ground of the truth. 

###### 16 
And without controversy great is the [^i]mystery of godliness: God[^j] was manifested in the flesh, Justified in the Spirit, Seen by angels, Preached among the Gentiles, Believed on in the world, Received up in glory.

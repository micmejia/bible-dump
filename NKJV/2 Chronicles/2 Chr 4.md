# 2 Chronicles 4

***


###### 1 
Moreover he made a bronze altar: twenty cubits was its length, twenty cubits its width, and ten cubits its height. 

###### 2 
Then he made the [^a]Sea of cast _bronze,_ ten cubits from one brim to the other; _it was_ completely round. Its height _was_ five cubits, and a line of thirty cubits measured its circumference. 

###### 3 
And under it _was_ the likeness of oxen encircling it all around, ten to a cubit, all the way around the Sea. The oxen _were_ cast in two rows, when it was cast. 

###### 4 
It stood on twelve oxen: three looking toward the north, three looking toward the west, three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; the Sea _was set_ upon them, and all their back parts _pointed_ inward. 

###### 5 
It _was_ a handbreadth thick; and its brim was shaped like the brim of a cup, _like_ a lily blossom. It contained [^b]three thousand baths. 

###### 6 
He also made ten lavers, and put five on the right side and five on the left, to wash in them; such things as they offered for the burnt offering they would wash in them, but the [^c]Sea _was_ for the priests to wash in. 

###### 7 
And he made ten lampstands of gold according to their design, and set _them_ in the temple, five on the right side and five on the left. 

###### 8 
He also made ten tables, and placed _them_ in the temple, five on the right side and five on the left. And he made one hundred bowls of gold. 

###### 9 
Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court and doors for the court; and he overlaid these doors with bronze. 

###### 10 
He set the Sea on the right side, toward the southeast. 

###### 11 
Then Huram made the pots and the shovels and the bowls. So Huram finished doing the work that he was to do for King Solomon for the house of God: 

###### 12 
the two pillars and the bowl-shaped capitals _that were_ on top of the two pillars; the two networks covering the two bowl-shaped capitals which _were_ on top of the pillars; 

###### 13 
four hundred pomegranates for the two networks (two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowl-shaped capitals that _were_ on the pillars); 

###### 14 
he also made carts and the lavers on the carts; 

###### 15 
one Sea and twelve oxen under it; 

###### 16 
also the pots, the shovels, the forks--and all their articles Huram his [^d]master _craftsman_ made of burnished bronze for King Solomon for the house of the Lord. 

###### 17 
In the plain of Jordan the king had them cast in clay molds, between Succoth and [^e]Zeredah. 

###### 18 
And Solomon had all these articles made in such great abundance that the weight of the bronze was not determined. 

###### 19 
Thus Solomon had all the furnishings made for the house of God: the altar of gold and the tables on which _was_ the showbread; 

###### 20 
the lampstands with their lamps of pure gold, to burn in the prescribed manner in front of the inner sanctuary, 

###### 21 
with the flowers and the lamps and the wick-trimmers of gold, of purest gold; 

###### 22 
the trimmers, the bowls, the ladles, and the censers of pure gold. As for the entry of the [^f]sanctuary, its inner doors to the Most Holy _Place,_ and the doors of the main hall of the temple, _were_ gold.

# 2 Corinthians 1

***


###### 1 
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy _our_ brother, To the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints who are in all Achaia: 

###### 2 
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. ## Comfort in Suffering 

###### 3 
Blessed _be_ the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort, 

###### 4 
who comforts us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort those who are in any [^a]trouble, with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God. 

###### 5 
For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our [^b]consolation also abounds through Christ. 

###### 6 
Now if we are afflicted, _it is_ for your consolation and salvation, which is effective for enduring the same sufferings which we also suffer. Or if we are comforted, _it is_ for your consolation and salvation. 

###### 7 
And our hope for you _is_ steadfast, because we know that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so also _you will partake_ of the consolation. ## Delivered from Suffering 

###### 8 
For we do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, of our [^c]trouble which came to us in Asia: that we were burdened beyond measure, above strength, so that we despaired even of life. 

###### 9 
Yes, we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves but in God who raises the dead, 

###### 10 
who delivered us from so great a death, and [^d]does deliver us; in whom we trust that He will still deliver _us,_ 

###### 11 
you also helping together in prayer for us, that thanks may be given by many persons on [^e]our behalf for the gift _granted_ to us through many. ## Paul's Sincerity 

###### 12 
For our boasting is this: the testimony of our conscience that we conducted ourselves in the world in [^f]simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom but by the grace of God, and more abundantly toward you. 

###### 13 
For we are not writing any other things to you than what you read or understand. Now I trust you will understand, even to the end 

###### 14 
(as also you have understood us in part), that we are your boast as you also _are_ ours, in the day of the Lord Jesus. ## Sparing the Church 

###### 15 
And in this confidence I intended to come to you before, that you might have a second benefit-- 

###### 16 
to pass by way of you to Macedonia, to come again from Macedonia to you, and be helped by you on my way to Judea. 

###### 17 
Therefore, when I was planning this, did I do it lightly? Or the things I plan, do I plan according to the flesh, that with me there should be Yes, Yes, and No, No? 

###### 18 
But _as_ God _is_ faithful, our [^g]word to you was not Yes and No. 

###### 19 
For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us--by me, Silvanus, and Timothy--was not Yes and No, but in Him was Yes. 

###### 20 
For all the promises of God in Him _are_ Yes, and in Him Amen, to the glory of God through us. 

###### 21 
Now He who establishes us with you in Christ and has anointed us _is_ God, 

###### 22 
who also has sealed us and given us the Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee. 

###### 23 
Moreover I call God as witness against my soul, that to spare you I came no more to Corinth. 

###### 24 
Not that we [^h]have dominion over your faith, but are fellow workers for your joy; for by faith you stand.

# 2 Corinthians 2

***


###### 1 
But I determined this within myself, that I would not come again to you in sorrow. 

###### 2 
For if I make you sorrowful, then who is he who makes me glad but the one who is made sorrowful by me? ## Forgive the Offender 

###### 3 
And I wrote this very thing to you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow over those from whom I ought to have joy, having confidence in you all that my joy is _the joy_ of you all. 

###### 4 
For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you, with many tears, not that you should be grieved, but that you might know the love which I have so abundantly for you. 

###### 5 
But if anyone has caused grief, he has not grieved me, but all of you to some extent--not to be too severe. 

###### 6 
This punishment which _was inflicted_ by the majority _is_ sufficient for such a man, 

###### 7 
so that, on the contrary, you _ought_ rather to forgive and comfort _him_, lest perhaps such a one be swallowed up with too much sorrow. 

###### 8 
Therefore I urge you to reaffirm _your_ love to him. 

###### 9 
For to this end I also wrote, that I might put you to the test, whether you are obedient in all things. 

###### 10 
Now whom you forgive anything, I also _forgive_. For if indeed I have forgiven anything, I have forgiven that one for your sakes in the presence of Christ, 

###### 11 
lest Satan should take advantage of us; for we are not ignorant of his devices.

## Triumph in Christ 

###### 12 
Furthermore, when I came to Troas to _preach_ Christ's gospel, and a door was opened to me by the Lord, 

###### 13 
I had no rest in my spirit, because I did not find Titus my brother; but taking my leave of them, I departed for Macedonia. 

###### 14 
Now thanks _be_ to God who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and through us diffuses the fragrance of His knowledge in every place. 

###### 15 
For we are to God the fragrance of Christ among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing. 

###### 16 
To the one _we are_ the aroma of death _leading_ to death, and to the other the aroma of life _leading_ to life. And who _is_ sufficient for these things? 

###### 17 
For we are not, as so many, peddling the word of God; but as of sincerity, but as from God, we speak in the sight of God in Christ.

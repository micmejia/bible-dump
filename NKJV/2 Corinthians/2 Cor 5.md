# 2 Corinthians 5

***


###### 1 
For we know that if our earthly house, _this_ tent, is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. 

###### 2 
For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed with our habitation which is from heaven, 

###### 3 
if indeed, having been clothed, we shall not be found naked. 

###### 4 
For we who are in _this_ tent groan, being burdened, not because we want to be unclothed, but further clothed, that mortality may be swallowed up by life. 

###### 5 
Now He who has prepared us for this very thing _is_ God, who also has given us the Spirit as a guarantee. 

###### 6 
So _we are_ always confident, knowing that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord. 

###### 7 
For we walk by faith, not by sight. 

###### 8 
We are confident, yes, well pleased rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord.

## The Judgment Seat of Christ 

###### 9 
Therefore we make it our aim, whether present or absent, to be well pleasing to Him. 

###### 10 
For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things _done_ in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad. 

###### 11 
Knowing, therefore, the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are well known to God, and I also trust are well known in your consciences.

## Be Reconciled to God 

###### 12 
For we do not commend ourselves again to you, but give you opportunity to boast on our behalf, that you may have _an answer_ for those who boast in appearance and not in heart. 

###### 13 
For if we are beside ourselves, _it is_ for God; or if we are of sound mind, _it is_ for you. 

###### 14 
For the love of Christ compels us, because we judge thus: that if One died for all, then all died; 

###### 15 
and He died for all, that those who live should live no longer for themselves, but for Him who died for them and rose again. 

###### 16 
Therefore, from now on, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know _Him thus_ no longer. 

###### 17 
Therefore, if anyone _is_ in Christ, _he is_ a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new. 

###### 18 
Now all things _are_ of God, who has reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation, 

###### 19 
that is, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not imputing their trespasses to them, and has committed to us the word of reconciliation. 

###### 20 
Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were pleading through us: we implore _you_ on Christ's behalf, be reconciled to God. 

###### 21 
For He made Him who knew no sin _to be_ sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.

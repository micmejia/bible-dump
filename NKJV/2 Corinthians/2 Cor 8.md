# 2 Corinthians 8

***


###### 1 
Moreover, brethren, we make known to you the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia: 

###### 2 
that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded in the riches of their liberality. 

###### 3 
For I bear witness that according to _their_ ability, yes, and beyond _their_ ability, _they were_ freely willing, 

###### 4 
imploring us with much urgency that we would receive the gift and the fellowship of the ministering to the saints. 

###### 5 
And not _only_ as we had hoped, but they first gave themselves to the Lord, and _then_ to us by the will of God. 

###### 6 
So we urged Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also complete this grace in you as well. 

###### 7 
But as you abound in everything--in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in all diligence, and in your love for us--_see_ that you abound in this grace also. ## Christ Our Pattern 

###### 8 
I speak not by commandment, but I am testing the sincerity of your love by the diligence of others. 

###### 9 
For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that you through His poverty might become rich. 

###### 10 
And in this I give advice: It is to your advantage not only to be doing what you began and were desiring to do a year ago; 

###### 11 
but now you also must complete the doing _of it;_ that as _there was_ a readiness to desire _it,_ so _there_ also _may be_ a completion out of what _you_ have. 

###### 12 
For if there is first a willing mind, _it is_ accepted according to what one has, _and_ not according to what he does not have. 

###### 13 
For _I do_ not _mean_ that others should be eased and you burdened; 

###### 14 
but by an equality, _that_ now at this time your abundance _may supply_ their lack, that their abundance also may _supply_ your lack--that there may be equality. 

###### 15 
As it is written, "He who _gathered_ much had nothing left over, and he who _gathered_ little had no lack." ## Collection for the Judean Saints 

###### 16 
But thanks _be_ to God who puts the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus. 

###### 17 
For he not only accepted the exhortation, but being more diligent, he went to you of his own accord. 

###### 18 
And we have sent with him the brother whose praise _is_ in the gospel throughout all the churches, 

###### 19 
and not only _that,_ but who was also chosen by the churches to travel with us with this gift, which is administered by us to the glory of the Lord Himself and _to show_ your ready mind, 

###### 20 
avoiding this: that anyone should blame us in this lavish gift which is administered by us-- 

###### 21 
providing honorable things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men. 

###### 22 
And we have sent with them our brother whom we have often proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, because of the great confidence which _we have_ in you. 

###### 23 
If _anyone inquires_ about Titus, _he is_ my partner and fellow worker concerning you. Or if our brethren _are inquired about, they are_ messengers of the churches, the glory of Christ. 

###### 24 
Therefore show to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love and of our boasting on your behalf.

# 2 Corinthians 9

***


###### 1 
Now concerning the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you; 

###### 2 
for I know your willingness, about which I boast of you to the Macedonians, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal has stirred up the majority. 

###### 3 
Yet I have sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this respect, that, as I said, you may be ready; 

###### 4 
lest if _some_ Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we (not to mention you!) should be ashamed of this [^a]confident boasting. 

###### 5 
Therefore I thought it necessary to [^b]exhort the brethren to go to you ahead of time, and prepare your generous gift beforehand, which _you had_ previously promised, that it may be ready as _a matter of_ generosity and not as a [^c]grudging obligation. ## The Cheerful Giver 

###### 6 
But this _I say:_ He who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows [^d]bountifully will also reap [^e]bountifully. 

###### 7 
_So let_ each one _give_ as he purposes in his heart, not grudgingly or of [^f]necessity; for God loves a cheerful giver. 

###### 8 
And God _is_ able to make all grace abound toward you, that you, always having all sufficiency in all _things,_ may have an abundance for every good work. 

###### 9 
As it is written: "He has dispersed abroad, He has given to the poor; His righteousness endures forever." 

###### 10 
Now [^g]may He who supplies seed to the sower, and bread for food, [^h]supply and multiply the seed you have _sown_ and increase the fruits of your righteousness, 

###### 11 
while _you are_ enriched in everything for all liberality, which causes thanksgiving through us to God. 

###### 12 
For the administration of this service not only supplies the needs of the saints, but also is abounding through many thanksgivings to God, 

###### 13 
while, through the proof of this ministry, they glorify God for the obedience of your confession to the gospel of Christ, and for _your_ liberal sharing with them and all _men,_ 

###### 14 
and by their prayer for you, who long for you because of the exceeding grace of God in you. 

###### 15 
Thanks _be_ to God for His indescribable gift!

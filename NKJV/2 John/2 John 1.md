# 2 John 1

***


###### 1 
The Elder, To the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth, and not only I, but also all those who have known the truth, 

###### 2 
because of the truth which abides in us and will be with us forever: 

###### 3 
Grace, mercy, _and_ peace will be with you from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.

## Walk in Christ's Commandments 

###### 4 
I rejoiced greatly that I have found _some_ of your children walking in truth, as we received commandment from the Father. 

###### 5 
And now I plead with you, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment to you, but that which we have had from the beginning: that we love one another. 

###### 6 
This is love, that we walk according to His commandments. This is the commandment, that as you have heard from the beginning, you should walk in it.

## Beware of Antichrist Deceivers 

###### 7 
For many deceivers have gone out into the world who do not confess Jesus Christ _as_ coming in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist. 

###### 8 
Look to yourselves, that we do not lose those things we worked for, but _that_ we may receive a full reward. 

###### 9 
Whoever transgresses and does not abide in the doctrine of Christ does not have God. He who abides in the doctrine of Christ has both the Father and the Son. 

###### 10 
If anyone comes to you and does not bring this doctrine, do not receive him into your house nor greet him; 

###### 11 
for he who greets him shares in his evil deeds.

## John's Farewell Greeting 

###### 12 
Having many things to write to you, I did not wish _to do so_ with paper and ink; but I hope to come to you and speak face to face, that our joy may be full. 

###### 13 
The children of your elect sister greet you. Amen.

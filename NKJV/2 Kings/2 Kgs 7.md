# 2 Kings 7

***


###### 1 
Then Elisha said, "Hear the word of the Lord. Thus says the Lord: 'Tomorrow about this time a [^a]seah of fine flour _shall be sold_ for a shekel, and two seahs of barley for a shekel, at the gate of Samaria.' " 

###### 2 
So an officer on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God and said, "Look, _if_ the Lord would make windows in heaven, could this thing be?" And he said, "In fact, you shall see _it_ with your eyes, but you shall not eat of it." ## The Syrians Flee 

###### 3 
Now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate; and they said to one another, "Why are we sitting here until we die? 

###### 4 
If we say, 'We will enter the city,' the famine _is_ in the city, and we shall die there. And if we sit here, we die also. Now therefore, come, let us surrender to the army of the Syrians. If they keep us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall only die." 

###### 5 
And they rose at twilight to go to the camp of the Syrians; and when they had come to the outskirts of the Syrian camp, to their surprise no one _was_ there. 

###### 6 
For the Lord had caused the army of the Syrians to hear the noise of chariots and the noise of horses--the noise of a great army; so they said to one another, "Look, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites and the kings of the Egyptians to attack us!" 

###### 7 
Therefore they arose and fled at twilight, and left the camp intact--their tents, their horses, and their donkeys--and they fled for their lives. 

###### 8 
And when these lepers came to the outskirts of the camp, they went into one tent and ate and drank, and carried from it silver and gold and clothing, and went and hid _them;_ then they came back and entered another tent, and carried _some_ from there _also,_ and went and hid _it._ 

###### 9 
Then they said to one another, "We are not doing right. This day _is_ a day of good news, and we remain silent. If we wait until morning light, some [^b]punishment will come upon us. Now therefore, come, let us go and tell the king's household." 

###### 10 
So they went and called to the gatekeepers of the city, and told them, saying, "We went to the Syrian camp, and surprisingly no one _was_ there, not a human sound--only horses and donkeys tied, and the tents intact." 

###### 11 
And the gatekeepers called out, and they told _it_ to the king's household inside. 

###### 12 
So the king arose in the night and said to his servants, "Let me now tell you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we _are_ hungry; therefore they have gone out of the camp to [^c]hide themselves in the field, saying, 'When they come out of the city, we shall catch them alive, and get into the city.' " 

###### 13 
And one of his servants answered and said, "Please, let several _men_ take five of the remaining horses which are left in the city. Look, they _may either become_ like all the multitude of Israel that are left in it; or indeed, _I say,_ they _may become_ like all the multitude of Israel left from those who are consumed; so let us send them and see." 

###### 14 
Therefore they took two chariots with horses; and the king sent them in the direction of the Syrian army, saying, "Go and see." 

###### 15 
And they went after them to the Jordan; and indeed all the road _was_ full of garments and weapons which the Syrians had thrown away in their haste. So the messengers returned and told the king. 

###### 16 
Then the people went out and plundered the tents of the Syrians. So a seah of fine flour was _sold_ for a shekel, and two seahs of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the Lord. 

###### 17 
Now the king had appointed the officer on whose hand he leaned to have charge of the gate. But the people trampled him in the gate, and he died, just as the man of God had said, who spoke when the king came down to him. 

###### 18 
So it happened just as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, "Two seahs of barley for a shekel, and a seah of fine flour for a shekel, shall be _sold_ tomorrow about this time in the gate of Samaria." 

###### 19 
Then that officer had answered the man of God, and said, "Now look, _if_ the Lord would make windows in heaven, could such a thing be?" And he had said, "In fact, you shall see _it_ with your eyes, but you shall not eat of it." 

###### 20 
And so it happened to him, for the people trampled him in the gate, and he died.

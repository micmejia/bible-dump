# 2 Peter 1

***


###### 1 
Simon Peter, a bondservant and apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who have [^a]obtained like[^b] precious faith with us by the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ: 

###### 2 
Grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord, 

###### 3 
as His divine power has given to us all things that _pertain_ to life and godliness, through the knowledge of Him who called us by glory and virtue, 

###### 4 
by which have been given to us exceedingly great and precious promises, that through these you may be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the [^c]corruption _that is_ in the world through lust. ## Fruitful Growth in the Faith 

###### 5 
But also for this very reason, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue, to virtue knowledge, 

###### 6 
to knowledge self-control, to self-control [^d]perseverance, to perseverance godliness, 

###### 7 
to godliness brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness love. 

###### 8 
For if these things are yours and abound, _you_ will be neither [^e]barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. 

###### 9 
For he who lacks these things is shortsighted, even to blindness, and has forgotten that he was cleansed from his old sins. 

###### 10 
Therefore, brethren, be even more diligent to make your call and election sure, for if you do these things you will never stumble; 

###### 11 
for so an entrance will be supplied to you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. ## Peter's Approaching Death 

###### 12 
For this reason I will not be negligent to remind you always of these things, though you know and are established in the present truth. 

###### 13 
Yes, I think it is right, as long as I am in this [^f]tent, to stir you up by reminding _you_, 

###### 14 
knowing that shortly I _must_ [^g]put off my tent, just as our Lord Jesus Christ showed me. 

###### 15 
Moreover I will be careful to ensure that you always have a reminder of these things after my [^h]decease. ## The Trustworthy Prophetic Word 

###### 16 
For we did not follow cunningly devised fables when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of His majesty. 

###### 17 
For He received from God the Father honor and glory when such a voice came to Him from the Excellent Glory: "This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." 

###### 18 
And we heard this voice which came from heaven when we were with Him on the holy mountain. 

###### 19 
[^i]And so we have the prophetic word confirmed, which you do well to heed as a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts; 

###### 20 
knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of any private [^j]interpretation, 

###### 21 
for prophecy never came by the will of man, but [^k]holy men of God spoke _as they were_ moved by the Holy Spirit. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

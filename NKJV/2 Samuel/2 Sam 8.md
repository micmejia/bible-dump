###### 1 
After this it came to pass that David [^a]attacked the Philistines and subdued them. And David took [^b]Metheg Ammah from the hand of the Philistines. 

###### 2 
Then he defeated Moab. Forcing them down to the ground, he measured them off with a line. With two lines he measured off those to be put to death, and with one full line those to be kept alive. So the Moabites became David's servants, _and_ brought tribute. 

###### 3 
David also defeated Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his territory at the River Euphrates. 

###### 4 
David took from him one thousand _chariots,_ [^c]seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand foot soldiers. Also David hamstrung all the chariot _horses_, except that he spared _enough_ of them for one hundred chariots. 

###### 5 
When the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David killed twenty-two thousand of the Syrians. 

###### 6 
Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became David's servants, _and_ brought tribute. So the Lord preserved David wherever he went. 

###### 7 
And David took the shields of gold that had belonged to the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. 

###### 8 
Also from [^d]Betah and from Berothai,[^e] cities of Hadadezer, King David took a large amount of bronze. 

###### 9 
When [^f]Toi king of Hamath heard that David had defeated all the army of Hadadezer, 

###### 10 
then Toi sent [^g]Joram his son to King David, to [^h]greet him and bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and defeated him (for Hadadezer had been at war with Toi); and _Joram_ brought with him articles of silver, articles of gold, and articles of bronze. 

###### 11 
King David also dedicated these to the Lord, along with the silver and gold that he had dedicated from all the nations which he had subdued-- 

###### 12 
from [^i]Syria, from Moab, from the people of Ammon, from the Philistines, from Amalek, and from the spoil of Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah. 

###### 13 
And David made _himself_ a name when he returned from killing eighteen thousand [^j]Syrians in the Valley of Salt. 

###### 14 
He also put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom he put garrisons, and all the Edomites became David's servants. And the Lord preserved David wherever he went. ## David's Administration 

###### 15 
So David reigned over all Israel; and David administered judgment and justice to all his people. 

###### 16 
Joab the son of Zeruiah _was_ over the army; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud _was_ recorder; 

###### 17 
Zadok the son of Ahitub and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar _were_ the priests; [^k]Seraiah _was_ the [^l]scribe; 

###### 18 
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada _was over_ both the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were [^m]chief ministers.

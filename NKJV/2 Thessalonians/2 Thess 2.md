# 2 Thessalonians 2

***


###### 1 
Now, brethren, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him, we ask you, 

###### 2 
not to be soon shaken in mind or troubled, either by spirit or by word or by letter, as if from us, as though the day of [^a]Christ had come. 

###### 3 
Let no one deceive you by any means; for _that Day will not come_ unless the falling away comes first, and the man of [^b]sin is revealed, the son of perdition, 

###### 4 
who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped, so that he sits [^c]as God in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God. 

###### 5 
Do you not remember that when I was still with you I told you these things? 

###### 6 
And now you know what is restraining, that he may be revealed in his own time. 

###### 7 
For the [^d]mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only [^e]He who now restrains _will do so_ until He is taken out of the way. 

###### 8 
And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will consume with the breath of His mouth and destroy with the brightness of His coming. 

###### 9 
The coming of the _lawless one_ is according to the working of Satan, with all power, signs, and lying wonders, 

###### 10 
and with all unrighteous deception among those who perish, because they did not receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved. 

###### 11 
And for this reason God will send them strong delusion, that they should believe the lie, 

###### 12 
that they all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness. ## Stand Fast 

###### 13 
But we are [^f]bound to give thanks to God always for you, brethren beloved by the Lord, because God from the beginning chose you for salvation through [^g]sanctification by the Spirit and belief in the truth, 

###### 14 
to which He called you by our gospel, for the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. 

###### 15 
Therefore, brethren, stand fast and hold the traditions which you were taught, whether by word or our [^h]epistle. 

###### 16 
Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, and our God and Father, who has loved us and given _us_ everlasting consolation and good hope by grace, 

###### 17 
comfort your hearts and [^i]establish you in every good word and work.

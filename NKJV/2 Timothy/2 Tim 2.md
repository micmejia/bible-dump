# 2 Timothy 2

***


###### 1 
You therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. 

###### 2 
And the things that you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit these to faithful men who will be able to teach others also. 

###### 3 
You therefore must endure[^a] hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. 

###### 4 
No one engaged in warfare entangles himself with the affairs of _this_ life, that he may please him who enlisted him as a soldier. 

###### 5 
And also if anyone competes in athletics, he is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules. 

###### 6 
The hardworking farmer must be first to partake of the crops. 

###### 7 
Consider what I say, and [^b]may the Lord give you understanding in all things. 

###### 8 
Remember that Jesus Christ, of the seed of David, was raised from the dead according to my gospel, 

###### 9 
for which I suffer trouble as an evildoer, _even_ to the point of chains; but the word of God is not chained. 

###### 10 
Therefore I endure all things for the sake of the [^c]elect, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. 

###### 11 
_This is_ a faithful saying: For if we died with _Him,_ We shall also live with _Him._ 

###### 12 
If we endure, We shall also reign with _Him._ If we deny _Him,_ He also will deny us. 

###### 13 
If we are faithless, He remains faithful; He cannot deny Himself. ## Approved and Disapproved Workers 

###### 14 
Remind _them_ of these things, charging _them_ before the Lord not to [^d]strive about words to no profit, to the ruin of the hearers. 

###### 15 
Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. 

###### 16 
But shun profane _and_ [^e]idle babblings, for they will [^f]increase to more ungodliness. 

###### 17 
And their message will spread like cancer. Hymenaeus and Philetus are of this sort, 

###### 18 
who have strayed concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past; and they overthrow the faith of some. 

###### 19 
Nevertheless the solid foundation of God stands, having this seal: "The Lord knows those who are His," and, "Let everyone who names the name of [^g]Christ depart from iniquity." 

###### 20 
But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay, some for honor and some for dishonor. 

###### 21 
Therefore if anyone cleanses himself from the latter, he will be a vessel for honor, [^h]sanctified and useful for the Master, prepared for every good work. 

###### 22 
Flee also youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. 

###### 23 
But avoid foolish and ignorant disputes, knowing that they generate strife. 

###### 24 
And a servant of the Lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all, able to teach, patient, 

###### 25 
in humility correcting those who are in opposition, if God perhaps will grant them repentance, so that they may know the truth, 

###### 26 
and _that_ they may come to their senses _and_ _escape_ the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him to _do_ his will.

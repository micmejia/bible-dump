# 3 John 1

***


###### 1 
The Elder, To the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth: 

###### 2 
Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things and be in health, just as your soul prospers. 

###### 3 
For I rejoiced greatly when brethren came and testified of the truth _that is_ in you, just as you walk in the truth. 

###### 4 
I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in [^a]truth. ## Gaius Commended for Generosity 

###### 5 
Beloved, you do faithfully whatever you do for the brethren [^b]and for strangers, 

###### 6 
who have borne witness of your love before the church. _If_ you send them forward on their journey in a manner worthy of God, you will do well, 

###### 7 
because they went forth for His name's sake, taking nothing from the Gentiles. 

###### 8 
We therefore ought to receive[^c] such, that we may become fellow workers for the truth. ## Diotrephes and Demetrius 

###### 9 
I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to have the preeminence among them, does not receive us. 

###### 10 
Therefore, if I come, I will call to mind his deeds which he does, prating[^d] against us with malicious words. And not content with that, he himself does not receive the brethren, and forbids those who wish to, putting _them_ out of the church. 

###### 11 
Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. He who does good is of God, [^e]but he who does evil has not seen God. 

###### 12 
Demetrius has a _good_ testimony from all, and from the truth itself. And we also [^f]bear witness, and you know that our testimony is true. ## Farewell Greeting 

###### 13 
I had many things to write, but I do not wish to write to you with pen and ink; 

###### 14 
but I hope to see you shortly, and we shall speak face to face. Peace to you. Our friends greet you. Greet the friends by name. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

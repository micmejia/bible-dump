# Acts 1

***


###### 1 
The former account I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach, 

###### 2 
until the day in which [^a]He was taken up, after He through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom He had chosen, 

###### 3 
to whom He also presented Himself alive after His suffering by many [^b]infallible proofs, being seen by them during forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God. ## The Holy Spirit Promised 

###### 4 
And being assembled together with _them,_ He commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the Promise of the Father, "which," _He said,_ "you have heard from Me; 

###### 5 
for John truly baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now." 

###### 6 
Therefore, when they had come together, they asked Him, saying, "Lord, will You at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?" 

###### 7 
And He said to them, "It is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father has put in His own authority. 

###### 8 
But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be [^c]witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth." ## Jesus Ascends to Heaven 

###### 9 
Now when He had spoken these things, while they watched, He was taken up, and a cloud received Him out of their sight. 

###### 10 
And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as He went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel, 

###### 11 
who also said, "Men of Galilee, why do you stand gazing up into heaven? This _same_ Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will so come in like manner as you saw Him go into heaven." ## The Upper Room Prayer Meeting 

###### 12 
Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey. 

###### 13 
And when they had entered, they went up into the upper room where they were staying: Peter, James, John, and Andrew; Philip and Thomas; Bartholomew and Matthew; James _the son_ of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot; and Judas _the son_ of James. 

###### 14 
These all continued with one [^d]accord in prayer [^e]and supplication, with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His brothers. ## Matthias Chosen 

###### 15 
And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the [^f]disciples (altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty), and said, 

###### 16 
"Men _and_ brethren, this Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus; 

###### 17 
for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry." 

###### 18 
(Now this man purchased a field with the [^g]wages of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his [^h]entrails gushed out. 

###### 19 
And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem; so that field is called in their own language, Akel Dama, that is, Field of Blood.) 

###### 20 
"For it is written in the Book of Psalms: 'Let his dwelling place be [^i]desolate, And let no one live in it'; and, 'Let another take his [^j]office.' 

###### 21 
"Therefore, of these men who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, 

###### 22 
beginning from the baptism of John to that day when He was taken up from us, one of these must become a witness with us of His resurrection." 

###### 23 
And they proposed two: Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. 

###### 24 
And they prayed and said, "You, O Lord, who know the hearts of all, show which of these two You have chosen 

###### 25 
to take part in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place." 

###### 26 
And they cast their lots, and the lot fell on Matthias. And he was numbered with the eleven apostles. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

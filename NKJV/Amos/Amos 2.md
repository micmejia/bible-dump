# Amos 2

***


###### 1 
Thus says the Lord: "For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will not turn away its _punishment,_ Because he burned the bones of the king of Edom to lime. 

###### 2 
But I will send a fire upon Moab, And it shall devour the palaces of Kerioth; Moab shall die with tumult, With shouting _and_ trumpet sound. 

###### 3 
And I will cut off the judge from its midst, And slay all its princes with him," Says the Lord. ## Judgment on Judah 

###### 4 
Thus says the Lord: "For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not turn away its _punishment,_ Because they have despised the law of the Lord, And have not kept His commandments. Their lies lead them astray, _Lies_ which their fathers followed. 

###### 5 
But I will send a fire upon Judah, And it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem." ## Judgment on Israel 

###### 6 
Thus says the Lord: "For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn away its _punishment,_ Because they sell the righteous for silver, And the poor for a pair of sandals. 

###### 7 
They [^a]pant after the dust of the earth _which is_ on the head of the poor, And pervert the way of the humble. A man and his father go in to the _same_ girl, To defile My holy name. 

###### 8 
They lie down by every altar on clothes taken in pledge, And drink the wine of [^b]the condemned _in_ the house of their god. 

###### 9 
"Yet _it was_ I _who_ destroyed the Amorite before them, Whose height _was_ like the height of the cedars, And he _was as_ strong as the oaks; Yet I destroyed his fruit above And his roots beneath. 

###### 10 
Also _it was_ I _who_ brought you up from the land of Egypt, And led you forty years through the wilderness, To possess the land of the Amorite. 

###### 11 
I raised up some of your sons as prophets, And some of your young men as Nazirites. _Is it_ not so, O you children of Israel?" Says the Lord. 

###### 12 
"But you gave the Nazirites wine to drink, And commanded the prophets saying, 'Do not prophesy!' 

###### 13 
"Behold, I am [^c]weighed down by you, As a cart full of sheaves [^d]is weighed down. 

###### 14 
Therefore [^e]flight shall perish from the swift, The strong shall not strengthen his power, Nor shall the mighty [^f]deliver himself; 

###### 15 
He shall not stand who handles the bow, The swift of foot shall not [^g]escape, Nor shall he who rides a horse deliver himself. 

###### 16 
The most [^h]courageous men of might Shall flee naked in that day," Says the Lord.

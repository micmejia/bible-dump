# Amos 5

***


###### 1 
Hear this word which I take up against you, a lamentation, O house of Israel: 

###### 2 
The virgin of Israel has fallen; She will rise no more. She lies forsaken on her land; _There is_ no one to raise her up. 

###### 3 
For thus says the Lord God: "The city that goes out by a thousand Shall have a hundred left, And that which goes out by a hundred Shall have ten left to the house of Israel." ## A Call to Repentance 

###### 4 
For thus says the Lord to the house of Israel: "Seek Me and live; 

###### 5 
But do not seek Bethel, Nor enter Gilgal, Nor pass over to Beersheba; For Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, And Bethel shall come to nothing. 

###### 6 
Seek the Lord and live, Lest He break out like fire _in_ the house of Joseph, And devour _it,_ With no one to quench _it_ in Bethel-- 

###### 7 
You who turn justice to wormwood, And lay righteousness to rest in the earth!" 

###### 8 
He made the Pleiades and Orion; He turns the shadow of death into morning And makes the day dark as night; He calls for the waters of the sea And pours them out on the face of the earth; The Lord _is_ His name. 

###### 9 
He [^a]rains ruin upon the strong, So that fury comes upon the fortress. 

###### 10 
They hate the one who rebukes in the gate, And they abhor the one who speaks uprightly. 

###### 11 
Therefore, because you [^b]tread down the poor And take grain [^c]taxes from him, Though you have built houses of hewn stone, Yet you shall not dwell in them; You have planted [^d]pleasant vineyards, But you shall not drink wine from them. 

###### 12 
For I know your manifold transgressions And your mighty sins: Afflicting the just _and_ taking bribes; Diverting the poor _from justice_ at the gate. 

###### 13 
Therefore the prudent keep silent at that time, For it _is_ an evil time. 

###### 14 
Seek good and not evil, That you may live; So the Lord God of hosts will be with you, As you have spoken. 

###### 15 
Hate evil, love good; Establish justice in the gate. It may be that the Lord God of hosts Will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph. ## The Day of the Lord 

###### 16 
Therefore the Lord God of hosts, the Lord, says this: "_There shall be_ wailing in all streets, And they shall say in all the highways, 'Alas! Alas!' They shall call the farmer to mourning, And skillful lamenters to wailing. 

###### 17 
In all vineyards _there shall be_ wailing, For I will pass through you," Says the Lord. 

###### 18 
Woe to you who desire the day of the Lord! For what good _is_ the day of the Lord to you? It _will be_ darkness, and not light. 

###### 19 
It _will be_ as though a man fled from a lion, And a bear met him! Or _as though_ he went into the house, Leaned his hand on the wall, And a serpent bit him! 

###### 20 
_Is_ not the day of the Lord darkness, and not light? _Is it not_ very dark, with no brightness in it? 

###### 21 
"I hate, I despise your feast days, And I do not savor your sacred assemblies. 

###### 22 
Though you offer Me burnt offerings and your grain offerings, I will not accept _them,_ Nor will I regard your fattened peace offerings. 

###### 23 
Take away from Me the noise of your songs, For I will not hear the melody of your stringed instruments. 

###### 24 
But let justice run down like water, And righteousness like a mighty stream. 

###### 25 
"Did you offer Me sacrifices and offerings In the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel? 

###### 26 
You also carried [^e]Sikkuth[^f] your king And Chiun, your idols, The star of your gods, Which you made for yourselves. 

###### 27 
Therefore I will send you into captivity beyond Damascus," Says the Lord, whose name _is_ the God of hosts. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

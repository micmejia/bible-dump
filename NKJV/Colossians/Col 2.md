# Colossians 2

***


###### 1 
For I want you to know what a great conflict[^a] I have for you and those in Laodicea, and _for_ as many as have not seen my face in the flesh, 

###### 2 
that their hearts may be encouraged, being knit together in love, and _attaining_ to all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the knowledge of the mystery of God, [^b]both of the Father and of Christ, 

###### 3 
in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. 

###### 4 
Now this I say lest anyone should deceive you with persuasive words. 

###### 5 
For though I am absent in the flesh, yet I am with you in spirit, rejoicing [^c]to see your _good_ order and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ. 

###### 6 
As you therefore have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in Him, 

###### 7 
rooted and built up in Him and established in the faith, as you have been taught, abounding [^d]in it with thanksgiving. 

###### 8 
Beware lest anyone [^e]cheat you through philosophy and empty deceit, according to the tradition of men, according to the basic principles of the world, and not according to Christ. 

###### 9 
For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead [^f]bodily; 

###### 10 
and you are complete in Him, who is the head of all [^g]principality and power. ## Not Legalism but Christ 

###### 11 
In Him you were also circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body [^h]of the sins of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ, 

###### 12 
buried with Him in baptism, in which you also were raised with _Him_ through faith in the working of God, who raised Him from the dead. 

###### 13 
And you, being dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, He has made alive together with Him, having forgiven you all trespasses, 

###### 14 
having wiped out the [^i]handwriting of requirements that was against us, which was contrary to us. And He has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross. 

###### 15 
Having disarmed principalities and powers, He made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them in it. 

###### 16 
So let no one judge you in food or in drink, or regarding a [^j]festival or a new moon or sabbaths, 

###### 17 
which are a shadow of things to come, but the [^k]substance is of Christ. 

###### 18 
Let no one cheat you of your reward, taking delight in _false_ humility and worship of angels, intruding into those things which he has [^l]not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind, 

###### 19 
and not holding fast to the Head, from whom all the body, nourished and knit together by joints and ligaments, grows with the increase _that is_ from God. 

###### 20 
[^m]Therefore, if you died with Christ from the basic principles of the world, why, as _though_ living in the world, do you subject yourselves to regulations-- 

###### 21 
"Do not touch, do not taste, do not handle," 

###### 22 
which all concern things which perish with the using--according to the commandments and doctrines of men? 

###### 23 
These things indeed have an appearance of wisdom in self-imposed religion, _false_ humility, and [^n]neglect of the body, _but are_ of no value against the indulgence of the flesh. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

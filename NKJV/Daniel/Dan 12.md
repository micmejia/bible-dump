# Daniel 12

***


###### 1 
"At that time Michael shall stand up, The great prince who stands _watch_ over the sons of your people; And there shall be a time of trouble, Such as never was since there was a nation, _Even_ to that time. And at that time your people shall be delivered, Every one who is found written in the book. 

###### 2 
And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, Some to everlasting life, Some to shame _and_ everlasting [^a]contempt. 

###### 3 
Those who are wise shall shine Like the brightness of the firmament, And those who turn many to righteousness Like the stars forever and ever. 

###### 4 
"But you, Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book until the time of the end; many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall increase." 

###### 5 
Then I, Daniel, looked; and there stood two others, one on this riverbank and the other on that riverbank. 

###### 6 
And _one_ said to the man clothed in linen, who _was_ above the waters of the river, "How long shall the fulfillment of these wonders _be?_" 

###### 7 
Then I heard the man clothed in linen, who _was_ above the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand to heaven, and swore by Him who lives forever, that _it shall be_ for a time, times, and half _a time;_ and when the power of the holy people has been completely shattered, all these _things_ shall be finished. 

###### 8 
Although I heard, I did not understand. Then I said, "My lord, what _shall be_ the end of these _things?_" 

###### 9 
And he said, "Go _your way,_ Daniel, for the words _are_ closed up and sealed till the time of the end. 

###### 10 
Many shall be purified, made white, and refined, but the wicked shall do wickedly; and none of the wicked shall understand, but the wise shall understand. 

###### 11 
"And from the time _that_ the daily _sacrifice_ is taken away, and the abomination of desolation is set up, _there shall be_ one thousand two hundred and ninety days. 

###### 12 
Blessed _is_ he who waits, and comes to the one thousand three hundred and thirty-five days. 

###### 13 
"But you, go _your way_ till the end; for you shall rest, and will arise to your inheritance at the end of the days." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

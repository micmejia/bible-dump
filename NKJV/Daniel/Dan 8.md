# Daniel 8

***


###### 1 
In[^a] the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar a vision appeared _to_ me--to me, Daniel--after the one that appeared to me the first time. 

###### 2 
I saw in the vision, and it so happened while I was looking, that I _was_ in Shushan,[^b] the [^c]citadel, which _is_ in the province of Elam; and I saw in the vision that I was by the River Ulai. 

###### 3 
Then I lifted my eyes and saw, and there, standing beside the river, was a ram which had two horns, and the two horns _were_ high; but one _was_ higher than the other, and the higher _one_ came up last. 

###### 4 
I saw the ram pushing westward, northward, and southward, so that no animal could [^d]withstand him; nor _was there any_ that could deliver from his hand, but he did according to his will and became great. 

###### 5 
And as I was considering, suddenly a male goat came from the west, across the surface of the whole earth, without touching the ground; and the goat _had_ a notable horn between his eyes. 

###### 6 
Then he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing beside the river, and ran at him with furious power. 

###### 7 
And I saw him confronting the ram; he was moved with rage against him, [^e]attacked the ram, and broke his two horns. There was no power in the ram to withstand him, but he cast him down to the ground and trampled him; and there was no one that could deliver the ram from his hand. 

###### 8 
Therefore the male goat grew very great; but when he became strong, the large horn was broken, and in place of it four notable ones came up toward the four winds of heaven. 

###### 9 
And out of one of them came a little horn which grew exceedingly great toward the south, toward the east, and toward the Glorious _Land._ 

###### 10 
And it grew up to the host of heaven; and it cast down _some_ of the host and _some_ of the stars to the ground, and trampled them. 

###### 11 
He even exalted _himself_ as high as the Prince of the host; and by him the daily _sacrifices_ were taken away, and the place of [^f]His sanctuary was cast down. 

###### 12 
Because of transgression, an army was given over _to the horn_ to oppose the daily _sacrifices;_ and he cast truth down to the ground. He did _all this_ and prospered. 

###### 13 
Then I heard a holy one speaking; and _another_ holy one said to that certain _one_ who was speaking, "How long _will_ the vision _be, concerning_ the daily _sacrifices_ and the transgression [^g]of desolation, the giving of both the sanctuary and the host to be trampled underfoot?" 

###### 14 
And he said to me, "For two thousand three hundred [^h]days; then the sanctuary shall be cleansed." ## Gabriel Interprets the Vision 

###### 15 
Then it happened, when I, Daniel, had seen the vision and was seeking the meaning, that suddenly there stood before me one having the appearance of a man. 

###### 16 
And I heard a man's voice between _the banks of_ the Ulai, who called, and said, "Gabriel, make this _man_ understand the vision." 

###### 17 
So he came near where I stood, and when he came I was afraid and fell on my face; but he said to me, "Understand, son of man, that the vision _refers_ to the time of the end." 

###### 18 
Now, as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep with my face to the ground; but he touched me, and stood me upright. 

###### 19 
And he said, "Look, I am making known to you what shall happen in the latter time of the indignation; for at the appointed time the end _shall be._ 

###### 20 
The ram which you saw, having the two horns--_they are_ the kings of Media and Persia. 

###### 21 
And the [^i]male goat _is_ the [^j]kingdom of Greece. The large horn that _is_ between its eyes _is_ the first king. 

###### 22 
As for the broken _horn_ and the four that stood up in its place, four kingdoms shall arise out of that nation, but not with its power. 

###### 23 
"And in the latter time of their kingdom, When the transgressors have reached their fullness, A king shall arise, Having fierce [^k]features, Who understands sinister schemes. 

###### 24 
His power shall be mighty, but not by his own power; He shall destroy [^l]fearfully, And shall prosper and thrive; He shall destroy the mighty, and _also_ the holy people. 

###### 25 
"Through his cunning He shall cause deceit to prosper under his [^m]rule; And he shall exalt _himself_ in his heart. He shall destroy many in _their_ prosperity. He shall even rise against the Prince of princes; But he shall be broken without _human_ [^n]means. 

###### 26 
"And the vision of the evenings and mornings Which was told is true; Therefore seal up the vision, For _it refers_ to many days _in the future._" 

###### 27 
And I, Daniel, fainted and was sick for days; afterward I arose and went about the king's business. I was [^o]astonished by the vision, but no one understood it. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Deuteronomy 33

***


###### 1 
Now this _is_ the blessing with which Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death. 

###### 2 
And he said: "The Lord came from Sinai, And dawned on them from Seir; He shone forth from Mount Paran, And He came with ten thousands of saints; From His right hand _Came_ a fiery law for them. 

###### 3 
Yes, He loves the people; All His saints _are_ in Your hand; They sit down at Your feet; _Everyone_ receives Your words. 

###### 4 
Moses [^a]commanded a law for us, A heritage of the congregation of Jacob. 

###### 5 
And He was King in Jeshurun, When the leaders of the people were gathered, All the tribes of Israel together. 

###### 6 
"Let Reuben live, and not die, _Nor_ let his men be few." 

###### 7 
And this he said of Judah: "Hear, Lord, the voice of Judah, And bring him to his people; Let his hands be sufficient for him, And may You be a help against his enemies." 

###### 8 
And of Levi he said: "_Let_ Your [^b]Thummim and Your Urim _be_ with Your holy one, Whom You tested at Massah, And with whom You contended at the waters of Meribah, 

###### 9 
Who says of his father and mother, 'I have not seen them'; Nor did he acknowledge his brothers, Or know his own children; For they have observed Your word And kept Your covenant. 

###### 10 
They shall teach Jacob Your judgments, And Israel Your law. They shall put incense before You, And a whole burnt sacrifice on Your altar. 

###### 11 
Bless his substance, Lord, And accept the work of his hands; Strike the loins of those who rise against him, And of those who hate him, that they rise not again." 

###### 12 
Of Benjamin he said: "The beloved of the Lord shall dwell in safety by Him, _Who_ shelters him all the day long; And he shall dwell between His shoulders." 

###### 13 
And of Joseph he said: "Blessed of the Lord _is_ his land, With the precious things of heaven, with the dew, And the deep lying beneath, 

###### 14 
With the precious fruits of the sun, With the precious produce of the months, 

###### 15 
With the best things of the ancient mountains, With the precious things of the everlasting hills, 

###### 16 
With the precious things of the earth and its fullness, And the favor of Him who dwelt in the bush. Let _the blessing_ come 'on the head of Joseph, And on the crown of the head of him _who was_ separate from his brothers.' 

###### 17 
His glory _is like_ a firstborn bull, And his horns _like_ the horns of the wild ox; Together with them He shall push the peoples To the ends of the earth; They _are_ the ten thousands of Ephraim, And they _are_ the thousands of Manasseh." 

###### 18 
And of Zebulun he said: "Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out, And Issachar in your tents! 

###### 19 
They shall call the peoples _to_ the mountain; There they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness; For they shall partake _of_ the abundance of the seas And _of_ treasures hidden in the sand." 

###### 20 
And of Gad he said: "Blessed _is_ he who enlarges Gad; He dwells as a lion, And tears the arm and the crown of his head. 

###### 21 
He provided the first _part_ for himself, Because a lawgiver's portion was reserved there. He came _with_ the heads of the people; He administered the justice of the Lord, And His judgments with Israel." 

###### 22 
And of Dan he said: "Dan _is_ a lion's whelp; He shall leap from Bashan." 

###### 23 
And of Naphtali he said: "O Naphtali, satisfied with favor, And full of the blessing of the Lord, Possess the west and the south." 

###### 24 
And of Asher he said: "Asher _is_ most blessed of sons; Let him be favored by his brothers, And let him dip his foot in oil. 

###### 25 
Your sandals _shall be_ iron and bronze; As your days, _so shall_ your strength _be._ 

###### 26 
"_There is_ no one like the God of Jeshurun, _Who_ rides the heavens to help you, And in His excellency on the clouds. 

###### 27 
The eternal God _is your_ refuge, And underneath _are_ the everlasting arms; He will thrust out the enemy from before you, And will say, 'Destroy!' 

###### 28 
Then Israel shall dwell in safety, The fountain of Jacob alone, In a land of grain and new wine; His heavens shall also drop dew. 

###### 29 
Happy _are_ you, O Israel! Who _is_ like you, a people saved by the Lord, The shield of your help And the sword of your majesty! Your enemies shall submit to you, And you shall tread down their [^c]high places."

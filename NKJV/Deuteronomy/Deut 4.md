# Deuteronomy 4

***


###### 1 
"Now, O Israel, listen to the statutes and the judgments which I teach you to observe, that you may live, and go in and [^a]possess the land which the Lord God of your fathers is giving you. 

###### 2 
You shall not add to the word which I command you, nor take from it, that you may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you. 

###### 3 
Your eyes have seen what the Lord did at Baal Peor; for the Lord your God has destroyed from among you all the men who followed Baal of Peor. 

###### 4 
But you who held fast to the Lord your God _are_ alive today, every one of you. 

###### 5 
"Surely I have taught you statutes and judgments, just as the Lord my God commanded me, that you should act according _to them_ in the land which you go to possess. 

###### 6 
Therefore be careful to observe _them;_ for this _is_ your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples who will hear all these statutes, and say, 'Surely this great nation _is_ a wise and understanding people.' 

###### 7 
"For what great nation _is there_ that has God[^b] _so_ near to it, as the Lord our God _is_ to us, for whatever _reason_ we may call upon Him? 

###### 8 
And what great nation _is there_ that has _such_ statutes and righteous judgments as are in all this law which I set before you this day? 

###### 9 
Only take heed to yourself, and diligently keep yourself, lest you forget the things your eyes have seen, and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life. And teach them to your children and your grandchildren, 

###### 10 
_especially concerning_ the day you stood before the Lord your God in Horeb, when the Lord said to me, 'Gather the people to Me, and I will let them hear My words, that they may learn to fear Me all the days they live on the earth, and _that_ they may teach their children.' 

###### 11 
"Then you came near and stood at the foot of the mountain, and the mountain burned with fire to the midst of heaven, with darkness, cloud, and thick darkness. 

###### 12 
And the Lord spoke to you out of the midst of the fire. You heard the sound of the words, but saw no [^c]form; _you_ only _heard_ a voice. 

###### 13 
So He declared to you His covenant which He commanded you to perform, the Ten Commandments; and He wrote them on two tablets of stone. 

###### 14 
And the Lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that you might [^d]observe them in the land which you cross over to possess. ## Beware of Idolatry 

###### 15 
"Take careful heed to yourselves, for you saw no form when the Lord spoke to you at Horeb out of the midst of the fire, 

###### 16 
lest you act corruptly and make for yourselves a carved image in the [^e]form of any figure: the likeness of male or female, 

###### 17 
the likeness of any animal that _is_ on the earth or the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the air, 

###### 18 
the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground or the likeness of any fish that _is_ in the water beneath the earth. 

###### 19 
And _take heed,_ lest you lift your eyes to heaven, and _when_ you see the sun, the moon, and the stars, all the host of heaven, you feel driven to worship them and serve them, which the Lord your God has [^f]given to all the peoples under the whole heaven as a heritage. 

###### 20 
But the Lord has taken you and brought you out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be His people, an inheritance, as you are this day. 

###### 21 
Furthermore the Lord was angry with me for your sakes, and swore that I would not cross over the Jordan, and that I would not enter the good land which the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance. 

###### 22 
But I must die in this land, I must not cross over the Jordan; but you shall cross over and [^g]possess that good land. 

###### 23 
Take heed to yourselves, lest you forget the covenant of the Lord your God which He made with you, and make for yourselves a carved image in the form of anything which the Lord your God has forbidden you. 

###### 24 
For the Lord your God _is_ a consuming fire, a jealous God. 

###### 25 
"When you beget children and grandchildren and have grown old in the land, and act corruptly and make a carved image in the form of anything, and do evil in the sight of the Lord your God to provoke Him to anger, 

###### 26 
I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that you will soon utterly perish from the land which you cross over the Jordan to possess; you will not [^h]prolong _your_ days in it, but will be utterly destroyed. 

###### 27 
And the Lord will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be left few in number among the nations where the Lord will drive you. 

###### 28 
And there you will serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see nor hear nor eat nor smell. 

###### 29 
But from there you will seek the Lord your God, and you will find _Him_ if you seek Him with all your heart and with all your soul. 

###### 30 
When you are in [^i]distress, and all these things come upon you in the latter days, when you turn to the Lord your God and obey His voice 

###### 31 
(for the Lord your God _is_ a merciful God), He will not forsake you nor destroy you, nor forget the covenant of your fathers which He swore to them. 

###### 32 
"For ask now concerning the days that are past, which were before you, since the day that God created man on the earth, and _ask_ from one end of heaven to the other, whether _any_ great _thing_ like this has happened, or _anything_ like it has been heard. 

###### 33 
Did _any_ people _ever_ hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as you have heard, and live? 

###### 34 
Or did God _ever_ try to go _and_ take for Himself a nation from the midst of _another_ nation, by trials, by signs, by wonders, by war, by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, and by great [^j]terrors, according to all that the Lord your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes? 

###### 35 
To you it was shown, that you might know that the Lord Himself _is_ God; _there is_ none other besides Him. 

###### 36 
Out of heaven He let you hear His voice, that He might instruct you; on earth He showed you His great fire, and you heard His words out of the midst of the fire. 

###### 37 
And because He loved your fathers, therefore He chose their [^k]descendants after them; and He brought you out of Egypt with His Presence, with His mighty power, 

###### 38 
driving out from before you nations greater and mightier than you, to bring you in, to give you their land _as_ an inheritance, as _it is_ this day. 

###### 39 
Therefore know this day, and consider _it_ in your heart, that the Lord Himself _is_ God in heaven above and on the earth beneath; _there is_ no other. 

###### 40 
You shall therefore keep His statutes and His commandments which I command you today, that [^l]it may go well with you and with your children after you, and that you may [^m]prolong _your_ days in the land which the Lord your God is giving you for all time." ## Cities of Refuge East of the Jordan 

###### 41 
Then Moses set apart three cities on this side of the Jordan, toward the rising of the sun, 

###### 42 
that the manslayer might flee there, who kills his neighbor unintentionally, without having hated him in time past, and that by fleeing to one of these cities he might live: 

###### 43 
Bezer in the wilderness on the plateau for the Reubenites, Ramoth in Gilead for the Gadites, and Golan in Bashan for the Manassites. ## Introduction to God's Law 

###### 44 
Now this _is_ the law which Moses set before the children of Israel. 

###### 45 
These _are_ the testimonies, the statutes, and the judgments which Moses spoke to the children of Israel after they came out of Egypt, 

###### 46 
on this side of the Jordan, in the valley opposite Beth Peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel defeated[^n] after they came out of Egypt. 

###### 47 
And they took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, who _were_ on this side of the Jordan, toward the [^o]rising of the sun, 

###### 48 
from Aroer, which _is_ on the bank of the River Arnon, even to Mount [^p]Sion (that is, Hermon), 

###### 49 
and all the plain on the east side of the Jordan as far as the Sea of the Arabah, below the slopes of Pisgah. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

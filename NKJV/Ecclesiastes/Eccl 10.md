# Ecclesiastes 10

***


###### 1 
Dead[^a] flies [^b]putrefy the perfumer's ointment, And cause it to give off a foul odor; _So does_ a little folly to one respected for wisdom _and_ honor. 

###### 2 
A wise man's heart _is_ at his right hand, But a fool's heart at his left. 

###### 3 
Even when a fool walks along the way, He lacks wisdom, And he shows everyone _that_ he _is_ a fool. 

###### 4 
If the spirit of the ruler rises against you, Do not leave your post; For conciliation[^c] pacifies great offenses. 

###### 5 
There is an evil I have seen under the sun, As an error proceeding from the ruler: 

###### 6 
Folly is set in [^d]great dignity, While the rich sit in a lowly place. 

###### 7 
I have seen servants on horses, While princes walk on the ground like servants. 

###### 8 
He who digs a pit will fall into it, And whoever breaks through a wall will be bitten by a serpent. 

###### 9 
He who quarries stones may be hurt by them, _And_ he who splits wood may be endangered by it. 

###### 10 
If the ax is dull, And one does not sharpen the edge, Then he must use more strength; But wisdom [^e]brings success. 

###### 11 
A serpent may bite when _it is_ not charmed; The [^f]babbler is no different. 

###### 12 
The words of a wise man's mouth _are_ gracious, But the lips of a fool shall swallow him up; 

###### 13 
The words of his mouth begin with foolishness, And the end of his talk _is_ raving madness. 

###### 14 
A fool also multiplies words. No man knows what is to be; Who can tell him what will be after him? 

###### 15 
The labor of fools wearies them, For they do not even know how to go to the city! 

###### 16 
Woe to you, O land, when your king _is_ a child, And your princes feast in the morning! 

###### 17 
Blessed _are_ you, O land, when your king _is_ the son of nobles, And your princes feast at the proper time-- For strength and not for drunkenness! 

###### 18 
Because of laziness the [^g]building decays, And through idleness of hands the house leaks. 

###### 19 
A feast is made for laughter, And wine makes merry; But money answers everything. 

###### 20 
Do not curse the king, even in your thought; Do not curse the rich, even in your bedroom; For a bird of the air may carry your voice, And a bird in flight may tell the matter. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

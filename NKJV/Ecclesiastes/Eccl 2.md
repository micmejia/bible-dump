# Ecclesiastes 2

***


###### 1 
I said in my heart, "Come now, I will test you with mirth; [^a]therefore enjoy pleasure"; but surely, this also _was_ vanity. 

###### 2 
I said of laughter--"Madness!"; and of mirth, "What does it accomplish?" 

###### 3 
I searched in my heart _how_ [^b]to gratify my flesh with wine, while guiding my heart with wisdom, and how to lay hold on folly, till I might see what _was_ good for the sons of men to do under heaven all the days of their lives. 

###### 4 
I made my works great, I built myself houses, and planted myself vineyards. 

###### 5 
I made myself gardens and orchards, and I planted all _kinds_ of fruit trees in them. 

###### 6 
I made myself water pools from which to [^c]water the growing trees of the grove. 

###### 7 
I acquired male and female servants, and had [^d]servants born in my house. Yes, I had greater possessions of herds and flocks than all who were in Jerusalem before me. 

###### 8 
I also gathered for myself silver and gold and the special treasures of kings and of the provinces. I acquired male and female singers, the delights of the sons of men, _and_ [^e]musical instruments of all kinds. 

###### 9 
So I became great and [^f]excelled more than all who were before me in Jerusalem. Also my wisdom remained with me. 

###### 10 
Whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them. I did not withhold my heart from any pleasure, For my heart rejoiced in all my labor; And this was my [^g]reward from all my labor. 

###### 11 
Then I looked on all the works that my hands had done And on the labor in which I had toiled; And indeed all _was_ vanity and grasping for the wind. _There was_ no profit under the sun. ## The End of the Wise and the Fool 

###### 12 
Then I turned myself to consider wisdom and madness and folly; For what _can_ the man _do_ who succeeds the king?-- _Only_ what he has already done. 

###### 13 
Then I saw that wisdom excels folly As light excels darkness. 

###### 14 
The wise man's eyes _are_ in his head, But the fool walks in darkness. Yet I myself perceived That the same event happens to them all. 

###### 15 
So I said in my heart, "As it happens to the fool, It also happens to me, And why was I then more wise?" Then I said in my heart, "This also _is_ vanity." 

###### 16 
For _there is_ no more remembrance of the wise than of the fool forever, Since all that now _is_ will be forgotten in the days to come. And how does a wise _man_ die? As the fool! 

###### 17 
Therefore I hated life because the work that was done under the sun _was_ distressing to me, for all _is_ vanity and grasping for the wind. 

###### 18 
Then I hated all my labor in which I had toiled under the sun, because I must leave it to the man who will come after me. 

###### 19 
And who knows whether he will be wise or a fool? Yet he will rule over all my labor in which I toiled and in which I have shown myself wise under the sun. This also _is_ vanity. 

###### 20 
Therefore I turned my heart and despaired of all the labor in which I had toiled under the sun. 

###### 21 
For there is a man whose labor _is_ with wisdom, knowledge, and skill; yet he must leave his [^h]heritage to a man who has not labored for it. This also _is_ vanity and a great evil. 

###### 22 
For what has man for all his labor, and for the striving of his heart with which he has toiled under the sun? 

###### 23 
For all his days _are_ sorrowful, and his work burdensome; even in the night his heart takes no rest. This also is vanity. 

###### 24 
Nothing _is_ better for a man _than_ that he should eat and drink, and _that_ his soul should enjoy good in his labor. This also, I saw, was from the hand of God. 

###### 25 
For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment, [^i]more than I? 

###### 26 
For _God_ gives wisdom and knowledge and joy to a man who _is_ good in His sight; but to the sinner He gives the work of gathering and collecting, that he may give to _him who is_ good before God. This also _is_ vanity and grasping for the wind. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

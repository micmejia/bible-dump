# Ecclesiastes 8

***


###### 1 
Who _is_ like a wise _man?_ And who knows the interpretation of a thing? A man's wisdom makes his face shine, And the sternness of his face is changed.

## Obey Authorities for God's Sake 

###### 2 
I _say,_ "Keep the king's commandment for the sake of your oath to God. 

###### 3 
Do not be hasty to go from his presence. Do not take your stand for an evil thing, for he does whatever pleases him." 

###### 4 
Where the word of a king _is, there is_ power; And who may say to him, "What are you doing?" 

###### 5 
He who keeps his command will experience nothing harmful; And a wise man's heart discerns both time and judgment, 

###### 6 
Because for every matter there is a time and judgment, Though the misery of man increases greatly. 

###### 7 
For he does not know what will happen; So who can tell him when it will occur? 

###### 8 
No one has power over the spirit to retain the spirit, And no one has power in the day of death. _There is_ no release from that war, And wickedness will not deliver those who are given to it. 

###### 9 
All this I have seen, and applied my heart to every work that is done under the sun: _There is_ a time in which one man rules over another to his own hurt.

## Death Comes to All 

###### 10 
Then I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of holiness, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done. This also _is_ vanity. 

###### 11 
Because the sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil. 

###### 12 
Though a sinner does evil a hundred _times,_ and his _days_ are prolonged, yet I surely know that it will be well with those who fear God, who fear before Him. 

###### 13 
But it will not be well with the wicked; nor will he prolong _his_ days, _which are_ as a shadow, because he does not fear before God. 

###### 14 
There is a vanity which occurs on earth, that there are just _men_ to whom it happens according to the work of the wicked; again, there are wicked _men_ to whom it happens according to the work of the righteous. I said that this also _is_ vanity. 

###### 15 
So I commended enjoyment, because a man has nothing better under the sun than to eat, drink, and be merry; for this will remain with him in his labor _all_ the days of his life which God gives him under the sun. 

###### 16 
When I applied my heart to know wisdom and to see the business that is done on earth, even though one sees no sleep day or night, 

###### 17 
then I saw all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun. For though a man labors to discover _it,_ yet he will not find _it;_ moreover, though a wise _man_ attempts to know _it,_ he will not be able to find _it._

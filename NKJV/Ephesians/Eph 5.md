# Ephesians 5

***


###### 1 
Therefore be imitators of God as dear children. 

###### 2 
And walk in love, as Christ also has loved us and given Himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling aroma. 

###### 3 
But fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness, let it not even be named among you, as is fitting for saints; 

###### 4 
neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor coarse jesting, which are not fitting, but rather giving of thanks. 

###### 5 
For this you know, that no fornicator, unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. 

###### 6 
Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience. 

###### 7 
Therefore do not be partakers with them. ## Walk in Light 

###### 8 
For you were once darkness, but now _you are_ light in the Lord. Walk as children of light 

###### 9 
(for the fruit of the Spirit _is_ in all goodness, righteousness, and truth), 

###### 10 
finding out what is acceptable to the Lord. 

###### 11 
And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather expose _them._ 

###### 12 
For it is shameful even to speak of those things which are done by them in secret. 

###### 13 
But all things that are exposed are made manifest by the light, for whatever makes manifest is light. 

###### 14 
Therefore He says: "Awake, you who sleep, Arise from the dead, And Christ will give you light." ## Walk in Wisdom 

###### 15 
See then that you walk circumspectly, not as fools but as wise, 

###### 16 
redeeming the time, because the days are evil. 

###### 17 
Therefore do not be unwise, but understand what the will of the Lord _is._ 

###### 18 
And do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissipation; but be filled with the Spirit, 

###### 19 
speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord, 

###### 20 
giving thanks always for all things to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, 

###### 21 
submitting to one another in the fear of God. ## Marriage--Christ and the Church 

###### 22 
Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord. 

###### 23 
For the husband is head of the wife, as also Christ is head of the church; and He is the Savior of the body. 

###### 24 
Therefore, just as the church is subject to Christ, so _let_ the wives _be_ to their own husbands in everything. 

###### 25 
Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself for her, 

###### 26 
that He might sanctify and cleanse her with the washing of water by the word, 

###### 27 
that He might present her to Himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she should be holy and without blemish. 

###### 28 
So husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies; he who loves his wife loves himself. 

###### 29 
For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as the Lord _does_ the church. 

###### 30 
For we are members of His body, of His flesh and of His bones. 

###### 31 
"For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh." 

###### 32 
This is a great mystery, but I speak concerning Christ and the church. 

###### 33 
Nevertheless let each one of you in particular so love his own wife as himself, and let the wife _see_ that she respects _her_ husband.

# Esther 7

***


###### 1 
So the king and Haman went to dine with Queen Esther. 

###### 2 
And on the second day, at the banquet of wine, the king again said to Esther, "What _is_ your petition, Queen Esther? It shall be granted you. And what _is_ your request, up to half the kingdom? It shall be done!" 

###### 3 
Then Queen Esther answered and said, "If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it pleases the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request. 

###### 4 
For we have been sold, my people and I, to be destroyed, to be killed, and to be annihilated. Had we been sold as male and female slaves, I would have held my tongue, although the enemy could never compensate for the king's loss." 

###### 5 
So King Ahasuerus answered and said to Queen Esther, "Who is he, and where is he, who would dare presume in his heart to do such a thing?" 

###### 6 
And Esther said, "The adversary and enemy _is_ this wicked Haman!" So Haman was terrified before the king and queen. 

###### 7 
Then the king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine _and went_ into the palace garden; but Haman stood before Queen Esther, pleading for his life, for he saw that evil was determined against him by the king. 

###### 8 
When the king returned from the palace garden to the place of the banquet of wine, Haman had fallen across the couch where Esther _was._ Then the king said, "Will he also assault the queen while I _am_ in the house?" As the word left the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face. 

###### 9 
Now Harbonah, one of the eunuchs, said to the king, "Look! The [^a]gallows, fifty cubits high, which Haman made for Mordecai, who spoke good on the king's behalf, is standing at the house of Haman." Then the king said, "Hang him on it!" 

###### 10 
So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the king's wrath subsided. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

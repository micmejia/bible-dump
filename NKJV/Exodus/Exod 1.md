# Exodus 1

***


###### 1 
Now these _are_ the names of the children of Israel who came to Egypt; each man and his household came with Jacob: 

###### 2 
Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah; 

###### 3 
Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin; 

###### 4 
Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher. 

###### 5 
All those [^a]who were descendants of Jacob were seventy[^b] persons (for Joseph was in Egypt _already_). 

###### 6 
And Joseph died, all his brothers, and all that generation. 

###### 7 
But the children of Israel were fruitful and increased abundantly, multiplied and [^c]grew exceedingly mighty; and the land was filled with them. 

###### 8 
Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who did not know Joseph. 

###### 9 
And he said to his people, "Look, the people of the children of Israel _are_ more and mightier than we; 

###### 10 
come, let us deal shrewdly with them, lest they multiply, and it happen, in the event of war, that they also join our enemies and fight against us, and _so_ go up out of the land." 

###### 11 
Therefore they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh supply cities, Pithom and Raamses. 

###### 12 
But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were in dread of the children of Israel. 

###### 13 
So the Egyptians made the children of Israel serve with [^d]rigor. 

###### 14 
And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage--in mortar, in brick, and in all manner of service in the field. All their service in which they made them serve _was_ with rigor. 

###### 15 
Then the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of one _was_ Shiphrah and the name of the other Puah; 

###### 16 
and he said, "When you do the duties of a midwife for the Hebrew women, and see _them_ on the birthstools, if it _is_ a son, then you shall kill him; but if it _is_ a daughter, then she shall live." 

###### 17 
But the midwives feared God, and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the male children alive. 

###### 18 
So the king of Egypt called for the midwives and said to them, "Why have you done this thing, and saved the male children alive?" 

###### 19 
And the midwives said to Pharaoh, "Because the Hebrew women _are_ not like the Egyptian women; for they [^e]_are_ lively and give birth before the midwives come to them." 

###### 20 
Therefore God dealt well with the midwives, and the people multiplied and [^f]grew very mighty. 

###### 21 
And so it was, because the midwives feared God, that He [^g]provided households for them. 

###### 22 
So Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, "Every son who is [^h]born you shall cast into the river, and every daughter you shall save alive." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

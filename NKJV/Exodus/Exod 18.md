# Exodus 18

***


###### 1 
And Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses and for Israel His people--that the Lord had brought Israel out of Egypt. 

###### 2 
Then Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her back, 

###### 3 
with her two sons, of whom the name of one _was_ Gershom (for he said, "I have been a stranger in a foreign land") 

###### 4 
and the name of the other _was_ Eliezer (for _he said,_ "The God of my father _was_ my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh"); 

###### 5 
and Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses in the wilderness, where he was encamped at the mountain of God. 

###### 6 
Now he had said to Moses, "I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons with her." 

###### 7 
So Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, bowed down, and kissed him. And they asked each other about _their_ well-being, and they went into the tent. 

###### 8 
And Moses told his father-in-law all that the Lord had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, all the hardship that had come upon them on the way, and _how_ the Lord had delivered them. 

###### 9 
Then Jethro rejoiced for all the good which the Lord had done for Israel, whom He had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians. 

###### 10 
And Jethro said, "Blessed _be_ the Lord, who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of Pharaoh, _and_ who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians. 

###### 11 
Now I know that the Lord _is_ greater than all the gods; for in the very thing in which they behaved proudly, _He was_ above them." 

###### 12 
Then Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took a burnt offering and _other_ sacrifices _to offer_ to God. And Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law before God. 

###### 13 
And so it was, on the next day, that Moses sat to judge the people; and the people stood before Moses from morning until evening. 

###### 14 
So when Moses' father-in-law saw all that he did for the people, he said, "What _is_ this thing that you are doing for the people? Why do you alone sit, and all the people stand before you from morning until evening?" 

###### 15 
And Moses said to his father-in-law, "Because the people come to me to inquire of God. 

###### 16 
When they have a difficulty, they come to me, and I judge between one and another; and I make known the statutes of God and His laws." 

###### 17 
So Moses' father-in-law said to him, "The thing that you do _is_ not good. 

###### 18 
Both you and these people who _are_ with you will surely wear yourselves out. For this thing _is_ too much for you; you are not able to perform it by yourself. 

###### 19 
Listen now to my voice; I will give you counsel, and God will be with you: Stand before God for the people, so that you may bring the difficulties to God. 

###### 20 
And you shall teach them the statutes and the laws, and show them the way in which they must walk and the work they must do. 

###### 21 
Moreover you shall select from all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place _such_ over them _to be_ rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. 

###### 22 
And let them judge the people at all times. Then it will be _that_ every great matter they shall bring to you, but every small matter they themselves shall judge. So it will be easier for you, for they will bear _the burden_ with you. 

###### 23 
If you do this thing, and God _so_ commands you, then you will be able to endure, and all this people will also go to their place in peace." 

###### 24 
So Moses heeded the voice of his father-in-law and did all that he had said. 

###### 25 
And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people: rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. 

###### 26 
So they judged the people at all times; the hard cases they brought to Moses, but they judged every small case themselves. 

###### 27 
Then Moses let his father-in-law depart, and he went his way to his own land.

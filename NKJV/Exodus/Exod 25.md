# Exodus 25

***


###### 1 
Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: 

###### 2 
"Speak to the children of Israel, that they bring Me an [^a]offering. From everyone who gives it willingly with his heart you shall take My offering. 

###### 3 
And this _is_ the offering which you shall take from them: gold, silver, and bronze; 

###### 4 
blue, purple, and scarlet _thread,_ fine linen, and goats' _hair;_ 

###### 5 
ram skins dyed red, [^b]badger skins, and acacia wood; 

###### 6 
oil for the light, and spices for the anointing oil and for the sweet incense; 

###### 7 
onyx stones, and stones to be set in the ephod and in the breastplate. 

###### 8 
And let them make Me a sanctuary,[^c] that I may dwell among them. 

###### 9 
According to all that I show you, _that is,_ the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of all its furnishings, just so you shall make _it._ ## The Ark of the Testimony 

###### 10 
"And they shall make an ark of acacia wood; two and a half cubits _shall be_ its length, a cubit and a half its width, and a cubit and a half its height. 

###### 11 
And you shall overlay it with pure gold, inside and out you shall overlay it, and shall make on it a molding of gold all around. 

###### 12 
You shall cast four rings of gold for it, and put _them_ in its four corners; two rings _shall be_ on one side, and two rings on the other side. 

###### 13 
And you shall make poles _of_ acacia wood, and overlay them with gold. 

###### 14 
You shall put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark, that the ark may be carried by them. 

###### 15 
The poles shall be in the rings of the ark; they shall not be taken from it. 

###### 16 
And you shall put into the ark the Testimony which I will give you. 

###### 17 
"You shall make a mercy seat of pure gold; two and a half cubits _shall be_ its length and a cubit and a half its width. 

###### 18 
And you shall make two cherubim of gold; of hammered work you shall make them at the two ends of the mercy seat. 

###### 19 
Make one cherub at one end, and the other cherub at the other end; you shall make the cherubim at the two ends of it _of one piece_ with the mercy seat. 

###### 20 
And the cherubim shall stretch out _their_ wings above, covering the mercy seat with their wings, and they shall face one another; the faces of the cherubim _shall be_ toward the mercy seat. 

###### 21 
You shall put the mercy seat on top of the ark, and in the ark you shall put the Testimony that I will give you. 

###### 22 
And there I will meet with you, and I will speak with you from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim which _are_ on the ark of the Testimony, about everything which I will give you in commandment to the children of Israel. ## The Table for the Showbread 

###### 23 
"You shall also make a table of acacia wood; two cubits _shall be_ its length, a cubit its width, and a cubit and a half its height. 

###### 24 
And you shall overlay it with pure gold, and make a molding of gold all around. 

###### 25 
You shall make for it a frame of a handbreadth all around, and you shall make a gold molding for the frame all around. 

###### 26 
And you shall make for it four rings of gold, and put the rings on the four corners that _are_ at its four legs. 

###### 27 
The rings shall be close to the frame, as holders for the poles to bear the table. 

###### 28 
And you shall make the poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold, that the table may be carried with them. 

###### 29 
You shall make its dishes, its pans, its pitchers, and its bowls for pouring. You shall make them of pure gold. 

###### 30 
And you shall set the showbread on the table before Me always. ## The Gold Lampstand 

###### 31 
"You shall also make a lampstand of pure gold; the lampstand shall be of hammered work. Its shaft, its branches, its bowls, its _ornamental_ knobs, and flowers shall be _of one piece._ 

###### 32 
And six branches shall come out of its sides: three branches of the lampstand out of one side, and three branches of the lampstand out of the other side. 

###### 33 
Three bowls _shall be_ made like almond _blossoms_ on one branch, _with_ an _ornamental_ knob and a flower, and three bowls made like almond _blossoms_ on the other branch, _with_ an _ornamental_ knob and a flower--and so for the six branches that come out of the lampstand. 

###### 34 
On the lampstand itself four bowls _shall be_ made like almond _blossoms, each with_ its _ornamental_ knob and flower. 

###### 35 
And _there shall be_ a knob under the _first_ two branches of the same, a knob under the _second_ two branches of the same, and a knob under the _third_ two branches of the same, according to the six branches that extend from the lampstand. 

###### 36 
Their knobs and their branches _shall be of one piece;_ all of it _shall be_ one hammered piece of pure gold. 

###### 37 
You shall make seven lamps for it, and they shall arrange its lamps so that they give light in front of it. 

###### 38 
And its wick-trimmers and their trays _shall be_ of pure gold. 

###### 39 
It shall be made of a talent of pure gold, with all these utensils. 

###### 40 
And see to it that you make _them_ according to the pattern which was shown you on the mountain.

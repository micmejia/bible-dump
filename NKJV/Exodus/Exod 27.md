# Exodus 27

***


###### 1 
"You shall make an altar of acacia wood, five cubits long and five cubits wide--the altar shall be square--and its height _shall be_ three cubits. 

###### 2 
You shall make its horns on its four corners; its horns shall be of one piece with it. And you shall overlay it with bronze. 

###### 3 
Also you shall make its pans to receive its ashes, and its shovels and its basins and its forks and its firepans; you shall make all its utensils of bronze. 

###### 4 
You shall make a grate for it, a network of bronze; and on the network you shall make four bronze rings at its four corners. 

###### 5 
You shall put it under the rim of the altar beneath, that the network may be midway up the altar. 

###### 6 
And you shall make poles for the altar, poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with bronze. 

###### 7 
The poles shall be put in the rings, and the poles shall be on the two sides of the altar to bear it. 

###### 8 
You shall make it hollow with boards; as it was shown you on the mountain, so shall they make _it._ ## The Court of the Tabernacle 

###### 9 
"You shall also make the court of the tabernacle. For the south side _there shall be_ hangings for the court _made of_ fine woven linen, one hundred cubits long for one side. 

###### 10 
And its twenty pillars and their twenty sockets _shall be_ bronze. The hooks of the pillars and their bands _shall be_ silver. 

###### 11 
Likewise along the length of the north side _there shall be_ hangings one hundred _cubits_ long, with its twenty pillars and their twenty sockets of bronze, and the hooks of the pillars and their bands of silver. 

###### 12 
"And along the width of the court on the west side _shall be_ hangings of fifty cubits, with their ten pillars and their ten sockets. 

###### 13 
The width of the court on the east side _shall be_ fifty cubits. 

###### 14 
The hangings on _one_ side _of the gate shall be_ fifteen cubits, _with_ their three pillars and their three sockets. 

###### 15 
And on the other side _shall be_ hangings of fifteen _cubits, with_ their three pillars and their three sockets. 

###### 16 
"For the gate of the court _there shall be_ a screen twenty cubits long, _woven of_ blue, purple, and scarlet _thread,_ and fine woven linen, made by a weaver. It _shall have_ four pillars and four sockets. 

###### 17 
All the pillars around the court shall have bands of silver; their hooks _shall be_ of silver and their sockets of bronze. 

###### 18 
The length of the court _shall be_ one hundred cubits, the width fifty throughout, and the height five cubits, _made of_ fine woven linen, and its sockets of bronze. 

###### 19 
All the utensils of the tabernacle for all its service, all its pegs, and all the pegs of the court, _shall be_ of bronze. ## The Care of the Lampstand 

###### 20 
"And you shall command the children of Israel that they bring you pure oil of pressed olives for the light, to cause the lamp to [^a]burn continually. 

###### 21 
In the tabernacle of meeting, outside the veil which _is_ before the Testimony, Aaron and his sons shall tend it from evening until morning before the Lord. _It shall be_ a statute forever to their generations on behalf of the children of Israel.

# Exodus 37

***


###### 1 
Then Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood; two and a half cubits _was_ its length, a cubit and a half its width, and a cubit and a half its height. 

###### 2 
He overlaid it with pure gold inside and outside, and made a molding of gold all around it. 

###### 3 
And he cast for it four rings of gold _to be set_ in its four corners: two rings on one side, and two rings on the other side of it. 

###### 4 
He made poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold. 

###### 5 
And he put the poles into the rings at the sides of the ark, to bear the ark. 

###### 6 
He also made the mercy seat of pure gold; two and a half cubits _was_ its length and a cubit and a half its width. 

###### 7 
He made two cherubim of beaten gold; he made them of one piece at the two ends of the mercy seat: 

###### 8 
one cherub at one end on this side, and the other cherub at the _other_ end on that side. He made the cherubim at the two ends _of one piece_ with the mercy seat. 

###### 9 
The cherubim spread out _their_ wings above, _and_ covered the mercy seat with their wings. They faced one another; the faces of the cherubim were toward the mercy seat. ## Making the Table for the Showbread 

###### 10 
He made the table of acacia wood; two cubits _was_ its length, a cubit its width, and a cubit and a half its height. 

###### 11 
And he overlaid it with pure gold, and made a molding of gold all around it. 

###### 12 
Also he made a frame of a handbreadth all around it, and made a molding of gold for the frame all around it. 

###### 13 
And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings on the four corners that _were_ at its four legs. 

###### 14 
The rings were close to the frame, as holders for the poles to bear the table. 

###### 15 
And he made the poles of acacia wood to bear the table, and overlaid them with gold. 

###### 16 
He made of pure gold the utensils which were on the table: its dishes, its cups, its bowls, and its pitchers for pouring. ## Making the Gold Lampstand 

###### 17 
He also made the lampstand of pure gold; of hammered work he made the lampstand. Its shaft, its branches, its bowls, its _ornamental_ knobs, and its flowers were of the same piece. 

###### 18 
And six branches came out of its sides: three branches of the lampstand out of one side, and three branches of the lampstand out of the other side. 

###### 19 
There were three bowls made like almond _blossoms_ on one branch, with an _ornamental_ knob and a flower, and three bowls made like almond _blossoms_ on the other branch, with an _ornamental_ knob and a flower--and so for the six branches coming out of the lampstand. 

###### 20 
And on the lampstand itself _were_ four bowls made like almond _blossoms, each with_ its _ornamental_ knob and flower. 

###### 21 
_There was_ a knob under the _first_ two branches of the same, a knob under the _second_ two branches of the same, and a knob under the _third_ two branches of the same, according to the six branches extending from it. 

###### 22 
Their knobs and their branches were of one piece; all of it _was_ one hammered piece of pure gold. 

###### 23 
And he made its seven lamps, its wick-trimmers, and its trays of pure gold. 

###### 24 
Of a talent of pure gold he made it, with all its utensils. ## Making the Altar of Incense 

###### 25 
He made the incense altar of acacia wood. Its length _was_ a cubit and its width a cubit--_it was_ square--and two cubits _was_ its height. Its horns were _of one piece_ with it. 

###### 26 
And he overlaid it with pure gold: its top, its sides all around, and its horns. He also made for it a molding of gold all around it. 

###### 27 
He made two rings of gold for it under its molding, by its two corners on both sides, as holders for the poles with which to bear it. 

###### 28 
And he made the poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold. ## Making the Anointing Oil and the Incense 

###### 29 
He also made the holy anointing oil and the pure incense of sweet spices, according to the work of the perfumer.

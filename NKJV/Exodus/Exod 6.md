# Exodus 6

***


###### 1 
Then the Lord said to Moses, "Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh. For with a strong hand he will let them go, and with a strong hand he will drive them out of his land." 

###### 2 
And God spoke to Moses and said to him: "I _am_ [^a]the Lord. 

###### 3 
I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Almighty, but _by_ My name Lord[^b] I was not known to them. 

###### 4 
I have also [^c]established My covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their [^d]pilgrimage, in which they were [^e]strangers. 

###### 5 
And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel whom the Egyptians keep in bondage, and I have remembered My covenant. 

###### 6 
Therefore say to the children of Israel: 'I _am_ the Lord; I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, I will rescue you from their bondage, and I will redeem you with [^f]an outstretched arm and with great judgments. 

###### 7 
I will take you as My people, and I will be your God. Then you shall know that I _am_ the Lord your God who brings you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. 

###### 8 
And I will bring you into the land which I swore[^g] to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and I will give it to you _as_ a heritage: I _am_ the Lord.' " 

###### 9 
So Moses spoke thus to the children of Israel; but they did not heed Moses, because of anguish[^h] of spirit and cruel bondage. 

###### 10 
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 

###### 11 
"Go in, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the children of Israel go out of his land." 

###### 12 
And Moses spoke before the Lord, saying, "The children of Israel have not heeded me. How then shall Pharaoh heed me, for I _am_ [^i]of uncircumcised lips?" 

###### 13 
Then the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, and gave them a command[^j] for the children of Israel and for Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt. ## The Family of Moses and Aaron 

###### 14 
These _are_ the heads of their fathers' houses: The sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel, _were_ Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. These are the families of Reuben. 

###### 15 
And the sons of Simeon _were_ [^k]Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman. These _are_ the families of Simeon. 

###### 16 
These _are_ the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. And the years of the life of Levi _were_ one hundred and thirty-seven. 

###### 17 
The sons of Gershon _were_ Libni and Shimi according to their families. 

###### 18 
And the sons of Kohath _were_ Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. And the years of the life of Kohath _were_ one hundred and thirty-three. 

###### 19 
The sons of Merari _were_ Mahli and Mushi. These _are_ the families of Levi according to their generations. 

###### 20 
Now Amram took for himself Jochebed, his father's sister, as wife; and she bore him Aaron and Moses. And the years of the life of Amram _were_ one hundred and thirty-seven. 

###### 21 
The sons of Izhar _were_ Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri. 

###### 22 
And the sons of Uzziel _were_ Mishael, Elzaphan, and Zithri. 

###### 23 
Aaron took to himself Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Nahshon, as wife; and she bore him Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 

###### 24 
And the sons of Korah _were_ Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph. These are the families of the Korahites. 

###### 25 
Eleazar, Aaron's son, took for himself one of the daughters of Putiel as wife; and she bore him Phinehas. These _are_ the heads of the fathers' houses of the Levites according to their families. 

###### 26 
These _are the same_ Aaron and Moses to whom the Lord said, "Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies."[^l] 

###### 27 
These _are_ the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt. These _are the same_ Moses and Aaron. ## Aaron Is Moses' Spokesman 

###### 28 
And it came to pass, on the day the Lord spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt, 

###### 29 
that the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, "I _am_ the Lord. Speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say to you." 

###### 30 
But Moses said before the Lord, "Behold, I _am_ [^m]of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh heed me?"

# Ezekiel 1

***


###### 1 
Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth _month,_ on the fifth _day_ of the month, as I _was_ among the captives by the River Chebar, _that_ the heavens were opened and I saw visions[^a] of God. 

###### 2 
On the fifth _day_ of the month, which _was_ in the fifth year of King Jehoiachin's captivity, 

###### 3 
the word of the Lord came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the [^b]Chaldeans by the River Chebar; and the hand of the Lord was upon him there. 

###### 4 
Then I looked, and behold, a whirlwind was coming out of the north, a great cloud with raging fire engulfing itself; and brightness _was_ all around it and radiating out of its midst like the color of amber, out of the midst of the fire. 

###### 5 
Also from within it _came_ the likeness of four living creatures. And this _was_ their appearance: they had the likeness of a man. 

###### 6 
Each one had four faces, and each one had four wings. 

###### 7 
Their [^c]legs _were_ straight, and the soles of their feet _were_ like the soles of calves' feet. They sparkled like the color of burnished bronze. 

###### 8 
The hands of a man _were_ under their wings on their four sides; and each of the four had faces and wings. 

###### 9 
Their wings touched one another. _The creatures_ did not turn when they went, but each one went straight forward. 

###### 10 
As for the likeness of their faces, _each_ had the face of a man; each of the four had the face of a lion on the right side, each of the four had the face of an ox on the left side, and each of the four had the face of an eagle. 

###### 11 
Thus _were_ their faces. Their wings stretched upward; two _wings_ of each one touched one another, and two covered their bodies. 

###### 12 
And each one went straight forward; they went wherever the spirit wanted to go, and they did not turn when they went. 

###### 13 
As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance _was_ like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches going back and forth among the living creatures. The fire was bright, and out of the fire went lightning. 

###### 14 
And the living creatures ran back and forth, in appearance like a flash of lightning. 

###### 15 
Now as I looked at the living creatures, behold, a wheel _was_ on the earth beside each living creature with its four faces. 

###### 16 
The appearance of the wheels and their workings _was_ like the color of beryl, and all four had the same likeness. The appearance of their workings _was,_ as it were, a wheel in the middle of a wheel. 

###### 17 
When they moved, they went toward any one of four directions; they did not turn aside when they went. 

###### 18 
As for their rims, they were so high they were awesome; and their rims _were_ full of eyes, all around the four of them. 

###### 19 
When the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up. 

###### 20 
Wherever the spirit wanted to go, they went, _because_ there the spirit went; and the wheels were lifted together with them, for the spirit of the [^d]living creatures _was_ in the wheels. 

###### 21 
When those went, _these_ went; when those stood, _these_ stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up together with them, for the spirit of the [^e]living creatures _was_ in the wheels. 

###### 22 
The likeness of the [^f]firmament above the heads of the [^g]living creatures _was_ like the color of an awesome crystal, stretched out over their heads. 

###### 23 
And under the firmament their wings _spread out_ straight, one toward another. Each one had two which covered one side, and each one had two which covered the other side of the body. 

###### 24 
When they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of many waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a tumult like the noise of an army; and when they stood still, they let down their wings. 

###### 25 
A voice came from above the firmament that _was_ over their heads; whenever they stood, they let down their wings. 

###### 26 
And above the firmament over their heads _was_ the likeness of a throne, in appearance like a sapphire stone; on the likeness of the throne _was_ a likeness with the appearance of a man high above it. 

###### 27 
Also from the appearance of His waist and upward I saw, as it were, the color of amber with the appearance of fire all around within it; and from the appearance of His waist and downward I saw, as it were, the appearance of fire with brightness all around. 

###### 28 
Like the appearance of a rainbow in a cloud on a rainy day, so _was_ the appearance of the brightness all around it. This _was_ the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. ## Ezekiel Sent to Rebellious Israel So when I saw _it,_ I fell on my face, and I heard a voice of One speaking.

# Ezekiel 2

***


###### 1 
And He said to me, "Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak to you." 

###### 2 
Then the Spirit entered me when He spoke to me, and set me on my feet; and I heard Him who spoke to me. 

###### 3 
And He said to me: "Son of man, I am sending you to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against Me; they and their fathers have transgressed against Me to this very day. 

###### 4 
For _they are_ [^a]impudent and stubborn children. I am sending you to them, and you shall say to them, 'Thus says the Lord God.' 

###### 5 
As for them, whether they hear or whether they refuse--for they _are_ a rebellious house--yet they will know that a prophet has been among them. 

###### 6 
"And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them nor be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns _are_ with you and you dwell among scorpions; do not be afraid of their words or dismayed by their looks, though they _are_ a rebellious house. 

###### 7 
You shall speak My words to them, whether they hear or whether they refuse, for they _are_ rebellious. 

###### 8 
But you, son of man, hear what I say to you. Do not be rebellious like that rebellious house; open your mouth and eat what I give you." 

###### 9 
Now when I looked, there was a hand stretched out to me; and behold, a scroll of a book _was_ in it. 

###### 10 
Then He spread it before me; and _there was_ writing on the inside and on the outside, and written on it _were_ lamentations and mourning and woe.

# Ezekiel 21

***


###### 1 
And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, 

###### 2 
"Son of man, set your face toward Jerusalem, preach[^a] against the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel; 

###### 3 
and say to the land of Israel, 'Thus says the Lord: "Behold, I _am_ against you, and I will draw My sword out of its sheath and cut off both righteous and wicked from you. 

###### 4 
Because I will cut off both righteous and wicked from you, therefore My sword shall go out of its sheath against all flesh from south _to_ north, 

###### 5 
that all flesh may know that I, the Lord, have drawn My sword out of its sheath; it shall not return anymore." ' 

###### 6 
Sigh therefore, son of man, with [^b]a breaking heart, and sigh with bitterness before their eyes. 

###### 7 
And it shall be when they say to you, 'Why are you sighing?' that you shall answer, 'Because of the news; when it comes, every heart will melt, all hands will be feeble, every spirit will faint, and all knees will be weak _as_ water. Behold, it is coming and shall be brought to pass,' says the Lord God." 

###### 8 
Again the word of the Lord came to me, saying, 

###### 9 
"Son of man, prophesy and say, 'Thus says the Lord!' Say: 'A sword, a sword is sharpened And also polished! 

###### 10 
Sharpened to make a dreadful slaughter, Polished to flash like lightning! Should we then make mirth? It despises the scepter of My son, _As it does_ all wood. 

###### 11 
And He has given it to be polished, That it may be handled; This sword is sharpened, and it is polished To be given into the hand of the slayer.' 

###### 12 
"Cry and wail, son of man; For it will be against My people, Against all the princes of Israel. Terrors including the sword will be against My people; Therefore strike _your_ thigh. 

###### 13 
"Because _it is_ a testing, And what if _the sword_ despises even the scepter? _The scepter_ shall be no _more,_" says the Lord God. 

###### 14 
"You therefore, son of man, prophesy, And strike _your_ hands together. The third time let the sword do double _damage._ It _is_ the sword _that_ slays, The sword that slays the great _men,_ That enters their private chambers. 

###### 15 
I have set the point of the sword against all their gates, That the heart may melt and many may stumble. Ah! _It is_ made bright; _It is_ grasped for slaughter: 

###### 16 
"Swords[^c] at the ready! Thrust right! Set your blade! Thrust left-- Wherever your [^d]edge is ordered! 

###### 17 
"I also will beat My fists together, And I will cause My fury to rest; I, the Lord, have spoken." 

###### 18 
The word of the Lord came to me again, saying: 

###### 19 
"And son of man, appoint for yourself two ways for the sword of the king of Babylon to go; both of them shall go from the same land. Make a sign; put _it_ at the head of the road to the city. 

###### 20 
Appoint a road for the sword to go to Rabbah of the Ammonites, and to Judah, into fortified Jerusalem. 

###### 21 
For the king of Babylon stands at the parting of the road, at the fork of the two roads, to use divination: he shakes the arrows, he consults the [^e]images, he looks at the liver. 

###### 22 
In his right hand is the divination for Jerusalem: to set up battering rams, to call for a slaughter, to lift the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to heap up a _siege_ mound, and to build a wall. 

###### 23 
And it will be to them like a false divination in the eyes of those who have sworn oaths with them; but he will bring their iniquity to remembrance, that they may be taken. 

###### 24 
"Therefore thus says the Lord God: 'Because you have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your doings your sins appear--because you have come to remembrance, you shall be taken in hand. 

###### 25 
'Now to you, O profane, wicked prince of Israel, whose day has come, whose iniquity _shall_ end, 

###### 26 
thus says the Lord God: "Remove the turban, and take off the crown; Nothing _shall remain_ the same. Exalt the humble, and humble the exalted. 

###### 27 
[^f]Overthrown, overthrown, I will make it overthrown! It shall be no _longer,_ Until He comes whose right it is, And I will give it _to_ _Him_." ' ## A Sword Against the Ammonites 

###### 28 
"And you, son of man, prophesy and say, 'Thus says the Lord God concerning the Ammonites and concerning their reproach,' and say: 'A sword, a sword _is_ drawn, Polished for slaughter, For consuming, for flashing-- 

###### 29 
While they see false visions for you, While they divine a lie to you, To bring you on the necks of the wicked, the slain Whose day has come, Whose iniquity _shall_ end. 

###### 30 
'Return _it_ to its sheath. I will judge you In the place where you were created, In the land of your [^g]nativity. 

###### 31 
I will pour out My indignation on you; I will blow against you with the fire of My wrath, And deliver you into the hands of brutal men _who are_ skillful to destroy. 

###### 32 
You shall be fuel for the fire; Your blood shall be in the midst of the land. You shall not be remembered, For I the Lord have spoken.'

# Ezekiel 33

***


###### 1 
Again the word of the Lord came to me, saying, 

###### 2 
"Son of man, speak to the children of your people, and say to them: 'When I bring the sword upon a land, and the people of the land take a man from their territory and make him their watchman, 

###### 3 
when he sees the sword coming upon the land, if he blows the trumpet and warns the people, 

###### 4 
then whoever hears the sound of the trumpet and does not take warning, if the sword comes and takes him away, his blood shall be on his _own_ head. 

###### 5 
He heard the sound of the trumpet, but did not take warning; his blood shall be upon himself. But he who takes warning will [^a]save his life. 

###### 6 
But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet, and the people are not warned, and the sword comes and takes _any_ person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at the watchman's hand.' 

###### 7 
"So you, son of man: I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; therefore you shall hear a word from My mouth and warn them for Me. 

###### 8 
When I say to the wicked, 'O wicked _man,_ you shall surely die!' and you do not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked _man_ shall die in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at your hand. 

###### 9 
Nevertheless if you warn the wicked to turn from his way, and he does not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have [^b]delivered your soul. 

###### 10 
"Therefore you, O son of man, say to the house of Israel: 'Thus you say, "If our transgressions and our sins _lie_ upon us, and we pine[^c] away in them, how can we then live?" ' 

###### 11 
Say to them: '_As_ I live,' says the Lord God, 'I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live. Turn, turn from your evil ways! For why should you die, O house of Israel?' ## The Fairness of God's Judgment 

###### 12 
"Therefore you, O son of man, say to the children of your people: 'The righteousness of the righteous man shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression; as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall because of it in the day that he turns from his wickedness; nor shall the righteous be able to live because of _his righteousness_ in the day that he sins.' 

###### 13 
When I say to the righteous _that_ he shall surely live, but he trusts in his own righteousness and commits iniquity, none of his righteous works shall be remembered; but because of the iniquity that he has committed, he shall die. 

###### 14 
Again, when I say to the wicked, 'You shall surely die,' if he turns from his sin and does [^d]what is lawful and [^e]right, 

###### 15 
_if_ the wicked restores the pledge, gives back what he has stolen, and walks in the statutes of life without committing iniquity, he shall surely live; he shall not die. 

###### 16 
None of his sins which he has committed shall be remembered against him; he has done what is lawful and right; he shall surely live. 

###### 17 
"Yet the children of your people say, 'The way of the Lord is not [^f]fair.' But it is their way which is not fair! 

###### 18 
When the righteous turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, he shall die because of it. 

###### 19 
But when the wicked turns from his wickedness and does what is lawful and right, he shall live because of it. 

###### 20 
Yet you say, 'The way of the Lord is not [^g]fair.' O house of Israel, I will judge every one of you according to his own ways." ## The Fall of Jerusalem 

###### 21 
And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth _month,_ on the fifth _day_ of the month, _that_ one who had escaped from Jerusalem came to me and said, "The city has been [^h]captured!" 

###### 22 
Now the hand of the Lord had been upon me the evening before the man came who had escaped. And He had opened my mouth; so when he came to me in the morning, my mouth was opened, and I was no longer mute. ## The Cause of Judah's Ruin 

###### 23 
Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying: 

###### 24 
"Son of man, they who inhabit those ruins in the land of Israel are saying, 'Abraham was only one, and he inherited the land. But we _are_ many; the land has been given to us as a possession.' 

###### 25 
"Therefore say to them, 'Thus says the Lord God: "You eat _meat_ with blood, you lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood. Should you then possess the land? 

###### 26 
You rely on your sword, you commit abominations, and you defile one another's wives. Should you then possess the land?" ' 

###### 27 
"Say thus to them, 'Thus says the Lord God: "_As_ I live, surely those who _are_ in the ruins shall fall by the sword, and the one who _is_ in the open field I will give to the beasts to be devoured, and those who _are_ in the strongholds and caves shall die of the pestilence. 

###### 28 
For I will make the land most desolate, [^i]her arrogant strength shall cease, and the mountains of Israel shall be so desolate that no one will pass through. 

###### 29 
Then they shall know that I _am_ the Lord, when I have made the land most desolate because of all their abominations which they have committed." ' ## Hearing and Not Doing 

###### 30 
"As for you, son of man, the children of your people are talking about you beside the walls and in the doors of the houses; and they speak to one another, everyone saying to his brother, 'Please come and hear what the word is that comes from the Lord.' 

###### 31 
So they come to you as people do, they sit before you _as_ My people, and they hear your words, but they do not do them; for with their mouth they show much love, _but_ their hearts pursue their _own_ gain. 

###### 32 
Indeed you _are_ to them as a very lovely song of one who has a pleasant voice and can play well on an instrument; for they hear your words, but they do not do them. 

###### 33 
And when this comes to pass--surely it will come--then they will know that a prophet has been among them." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

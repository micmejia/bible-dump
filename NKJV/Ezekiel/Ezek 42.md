# Ezekiel 42

***


###### 1 
Then he brought me out into the outer court, by the way toward the north; and he brought me into the chamber which _was_ opposite the separating courtyard, and which _was_ opposite the building toward the north. 

###### 2 
Facing the length, _which was_ one hundred cubits (the width was fifty cubits), was the north door. 

###### 3 
Opposite the inner court of twenty _cubits,_ and opposite the pavement of the outer court, _was_ gallery against gallery in three _stories._ 

###### 4 
In front of the chambers, toward the inside, _was_ a walk ten cubits wide, at a distance of one cubit; and their doors faced north. 

###### 5 
Now the upper chambers _were_ shorter, because the galleries took away _space_ from them more than from the lower and middle stories of the building. 

###### 6 
For they _were_ in three _stories_ and did not have pillars like the pillars of the courts; therefore _the upper level_ was [^a]shortened more than the lower and middle levels from the ground up. 

###### 7 
And a wall which _was_ outside ran parallel to the chambers, at the front of the chambers, toward the outer court; its length _was_ fifty cubits. 

###### 8 
The length of the chambers toward the outer court _was_ fifty cubits, whereas that facing the temple _was_ one hundred cubits. 

###### 9 
At the lower chambers _was_ the entrance on the east side, as one goes into them from the outer court. 

###### 10 
Also _there were_ chambers in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, opposite the separating courtyard and opposite the building. 

###### 11 
_There was_ a walk in front of them also, and their appearance _was_ like the chambers which _were_ toward the north; they _were_ as long and as wide as the others, and all their exits and entrances _were_ according to plan. 

###### 12 
And corresponding to the doors of the chambers that _were_ facing south, as one enters them, _there was_ a door in front of the walk, the way directly in front of the wall toward the east. 

###### 13 
Then he said to me, "The north chambers _and_ the south chambers, which _are_ opposite the separating courtyard, _are_ the holy chambers where the priests who approach the Lord shall eat the most holy offerings. There they shall lay the most holy offerings--the grain offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering--for the place _is_ holy. 

###### 14 
When the priests enter them, they shall not go out of the holy _chamber_ into the outer court; but there they shall leave their garments in which they minister, for they _are_ holy. They shall put on other garments; then they may approach _that_ which _is_ for the people." ## Outer Dimensions of the Temple 

###### 15 
Now when he had finished measuring the inner [^b]temple, he brought me out through the gateway that faces toward the east, and measured it all around. 

###### 16 
He measured the east side with the [^c]measuring rod, five hundred rods by the measuring rod all around. 

###### 17 
He measured the north side, five hundred rods by the measuring rod all around. 

###### 18 
He measured the south side, five hundred rods by the measuring rod. 

###### 19 
He came around to the west side _and_ measured five hundred rods by the measuring rod. 

###### 20 
He measured it on the four sides; it had a wall all around, five hundred _cubits_ long and five hundred wide, to separate the holy areas from the [^d]common.

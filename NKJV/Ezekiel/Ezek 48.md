***


###### 1 
"Now these _are_ the names of the tribes: From the northern border along the road to Hethlon at the entrance of Hamath, to Hazar Enan, the border of Damascus northward, in the direction of Hamath, _there shall be_ one _section for_ Dan from its east to its west side; 

###### 2 
by the border of Dan, from the east side to the west, one _section for_ Asher; 

###### 3 
by the border of Asher, from the east side to the west, one _section for_ Naphtali; 

###### 4 
by the border of Naphtali, from the east side to the west, one _section for_ Manasseh; 

###### 5 
by the border of Manasseh, from the east side to the west, one _section for_ Ephraim; 

###### 6 
by the border of Ephraim, from the east side to the west, one _section for_ Reuben; 

###### 7 
by the border of Reuben, from the east side to the west, one _section for_ Judah; 

###### 8 
by the border of Judah, from the east side to the west, shall be the district which you shall set apart, twenty-five thousand _cubits_ in width, and _in_ length the same as one of the _other_ portions, from the east side to the west, with the sanctuary in the center. 

###### 9 
"The district that you shall set apart for the Lord _shall be_ twenty-five thousand _cubits_ in length and ten thousand in width. 

###### 10 
To these--to the priests--the holy district shall belong: on the north twenty-five thousand _cubits in length,_ on the west ten thousand in width, on the east ten thousand in width, and on the south twenty-five thousand in length. The sanctuary of the Lord shall be in the center. 

###### 11 
_It shall be_ for the priests of the sons of Zadok, who are sanctified, who have kept My charge, who did not go astray when the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray. 

###### 12 
And _this_ district of land that is set apart shall be to them a thing most holy by the border of the Levites. 

###### 13 
"Opposite the border of the priests, the Levites _shall have an area_ twenty-five thousand _cubits_ in length and ten thousand in width; its entire length _shall be_ twenty-five thousand and its width ten thousand. 

###### 14 
And they shall not sell or exchange any of it; they may not alienate this best _part_ of the land, for _it is_ holy to the Lord. 

###### 15 
"The five thousand _cubits_ in width that remain, along the edge of the twenty-five thousand, shall be for general use by the city, for dwellings and common-land; and the city shall be in the center. 

###### 16 
These _shall be_ its measurements: the north side four thousand five hundred _cubits,_ the south side four thousand five hundred, the east side four thousand five hundred, and the west side four thousand five hundred. 

###### 17 
The common-land of the city shall be: to the north two hundred and fifty _cubits,_ to the south two hundred and fifty, to the east two hundred and fifty, and to the west two hundred and fifty. 

###### 18 
The rest of the length, alongside the district of the holy _section, shall be_ ten thousand _cubits_ to the east and ten thousand to the west. It shall be adjacent to the district of the holy _section,_ and its produce shall be food for the workers of the city. 

###### 19 
The workers of the city, from all the tribes of Israel, shall cultivate it. 

###### 20 
The entire district _shall be_ twenty-five thousand _cubits_ by twenty-five thousand _cubits,_ foursquare. You shall set apart the holy district with the property of the city. 

###### 21 
"The rest _shall belong_ to the prince, on one side and on the other of the holy district and of the city's property, next to the twenty-five thousand _cubits_ of the _holy_ district as far as the eastern border, and westward next to the twenty-five thousand as far as the western border, adjacent to the _tribal_ portions; _it shall belong_ to the prince. It shall be the holy district, and the sanctuary of the [^a]temple _shall be_ in the center. 

###### 22 
Moreover, apart from the possession of the Levites and the possession of the city _which are_ in the midst of what _belongs_ to the prince, _the area_ between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin shall belong to the prince. 

###### 23 
"As for the rest of the tribes, from the east side to the west, Benjamin _shall have_ one _section;_ 

###### 24 
by the border of Benjamin, from the east side to the west, Simeon _shall have_ one _section;_ 

###### 25 
by the border of Simeon, from the east side to the west, Issachar _shall have_ one _section;_ 

###### 26 
by the border of Issachar, from the east side to the west, Zebulun _shall have_ one _section;_ 

###### 27 
by the border of Zebulun, from the east side to the west, Gad _shall have_ one _section;_ 

###### 28 
by the border of Gad, on the south side, toward the [^b]South, the border shall be from Tamar _to_ the waters of [^c]Meribah _by_ Kadesh, along the brook to the Great Sea. 

###### 29 
This _is_ the land which you shall divide by lot as an inheritance among the tribes of Israel, and these _are_ their portions," says the Lord God. ## The Gates of the City and Its Name 

###### 30 
"These _are_ the exits of the city. On the north side, measuring four thousand five hundred _cubits_ 

###### 31 
(the gates of the city _shall be_ named after the tribes of Israel), the three gates northward: one gate for Reuben, one gate for Judah, and one gate for Levi; 

###### 32 
on the east side, four thousand five hundred _cubits,_ three gates: one gate for Joseph, one gate for Benjamin, and one gate for Dan; 

###### 33 
on the south side, measuring four thousand five hundred _cubits,_ three gates: one gate for Simeon, one gate for Issachar, and one gate for Zebulun; 

###### 34 
on the west side, four thousand five hundred _cubits_ with their three gates: one gate for Gad, one gate for Asher, and one gate for Naphtali. 

###### 35 
All the way around _shall be_ eighteen thousand _cubits;_ and the name of the city from _that_ day _shall be:_ THE[^d] LORD _IS_ THERE."

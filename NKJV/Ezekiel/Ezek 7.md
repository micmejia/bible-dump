# Ezekiel 7

***


###### 1 
Moreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying, 

###### 2 
"And you, son of man, thus says the Lord God to the land of Israel: 'An end! The end has come upon the four corners of the land. 

###### 3 
Now the end _has come_ upon you, And I will send My anger against you; I will judge you according to your ways, And I will repay you for all your abominations. 

###### 4 
My eye will not spare you, Nor will I have pity; But I will repay your ways, And your abominations will be in your midst; Then you shall know that I _am_ the Lord!' 

###### 5 
"Thus says the Lord God: 'A disaster, a singular disaster; Behold, it has come! 

###### 6 
An end has come, The end has come; It has dawned for you; Behold, it has come! 

###### 7 
Doom has come to you, you who dwell in the land; The time has come, A day of trouble _is_ near, And not of rejoicing in the mountains. 

###### 8 
Now upon you I will soon pour out My fury, And spend My anger upon you; I will judge you according to your ways, And I will repay you for all your abominations. 

###### 9 
'My eye will not spare, Nor will I have pity; I will [^a]repay you according to your ways, And your abominations will be in your midst. Then you shall know that I _am_ the Lord who strikes. 

###### 10 
'Behold, the day! Behold, it has come! Doom has gone out; The rod has blossomed, Pride has budded. 

###### 11 
Violence has risen up into a rod of wickedness; None of them _shall remain,_ None of their multitude, None of [^b]them; Nor _shall there be_ wailing for them. 

###### 12 
The time has come, The day draws near. 'Let not the buyer rejoice, Nor the seller mourn, For wrath _is_ on their whole multitude. 

###### 13 
For the seller shall not return to what has been sold, Though he may still be alive; For the vision concerns the whole multitude, And it shall not turn back; No one will strengthen himself Who lives in iniquity. 

###### 14 
'They have blown the trumpet and made everyone ready, But no one goes to battle; For My wrath _is_ on all their multitude. 

###### 15 
The sword _is_ outside, And the pestilence and famine within. Whoever _is_ in the field Will die by the sword; And whoever _is_ in the city, Famine and pestilence will devour him. 

###### 16 
'Those who survive will escape and be on the mountains Like doves of the valleys, All of them mourning, Each for his iniquity. 

###### 17 
Every hand will be feeble, And every knee will be _as_ weak _as_ water. 

###### 18 
They will also be girded with sackcloth; Horror will cover them; Shame _will be_ on every face, Baldness on all their heads. 

###### 19 
'They will throw their silver into the streets, And their gold will be like refuse; Their silver and their gold will not be able to deliver them In the day of the wrath of the Lord; They will not satisfy their souls, Nor fill their stomachs, Because it became their stumbling block of iniquity. 

###### 20 
'As for the beauty of his ornaments, He set it in majesty; But they made from it The images of their abominations-- Their detestable things; Therefore I have made it Like refuse to them. 

###### 21 
I will give it as plunder Into the hands of strangers, And to the wicked of the earth as spoil; And they shall defile it. 

###### 22 
I will turn My face from them, And they will defile My secret place; For robbers shall enter it and defile it. 

###### 23 
'Make a chain, For the land is filled with crimes of blood, And the city is full of violence. 

###### 24 
Therefore I will bring the worst of the Gentiles, And they will possess their houses; I will cause the pomp of the strong to cease, And their holy places shall be defiled. 

###### 25 
[^c]Destruction comes; They will seek peace, but _there shall be_ none. 

###### 26 
Disaster will come upon disaster, And rumor will be upon rumor. Then they will seek a vision from a prophet; But the law will perish from the priest, And counsel from the elders. 

###### 27 
'The king will mourn, The prince will be clothed with desolation, And the hands of the common people will tremble. I will do to them according to their way, And according to what they deserve I will judge them; Then they shall know that I _am_ the Lord!'

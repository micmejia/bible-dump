# Ezra 3

***


###### 1 
And when the seventh month had come, and the children of Israel _were_ in the cities, the people gathered together as one man to Jerusalem. 

###### 2 
Then [^a]Jeshua the son of Jozadak[^b] and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and his brethren, arose and built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings on it, as _it is_ written in the Law of Moses the man of God. 

###### 3 
Though fear _had come_ upon them because of the people of those countries, they set the altar on its [^c]bases; and they offered burnt offerings on it to the Lord, _both_ the morning and evening burnt offerings. 

###### 4 
They also kept the Feast of Tabernacles, as _it is_ written, and _offered_ the daily burnt offerings in the number required by ordinance for each day. 

###### 5 
Afterwards _they offered_ the regular burnt offering, and _those_ for New Moons and for all the appointed feasts of the Lord that were consecrated, and _those_ of everyone who willingly offered a freewill offering to the Lord. 

###### 6 
From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the Lord, although the foundation of the temple of the Lord had not been laid. 

###### 7 
They also gave money to the masons and the carpenters, and food, drink, and oil to the people of Sidon and Tyre to bring cedar logs from Lebanon to the sea, to Joppa, according to the permission which they had from Cyrus king of Persia. ## Restoration of the Temple Begins 

###### 8 
Now in the second month of the second year of their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem, Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, Jeshua the son of [^d]Jozadak, and the rest of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all those who had come out of the captivity to Jerusalem, began _work_ and appointed the Levites from twenty years old and above to oversee the work of the house of the Lord. 

###### 9 
Then Jeshua _with_ his sons and brothers, Kadmiel _with_ his sons, and the sons of [^e]Judah, arose as one to oversee those working on the house of God: the sons of Henadad _with_ their sons and their brethren the Levites. 

###### 10 
When the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the Lord, the[^f] priests stood in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with cymbals, to praise the Lord, according to the ordinance[^g] of David king of Israel. 

###### 11 
And they sang responsively, praising and giving thanks to the Lord: "For _He is_ good, For His mercy _endures_ forever toward Israel." Then all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the Lord, because the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid. 

###### 12 
But many of the priests and Levites and heads of the fathers' _houses,_ old men who had seen the first temple, wept with a loud voice when the foundation of this temple was laid before their eyes. Yet many shouted aloud for joy, 

###### 13 
so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people, for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the sound was heard afar off. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

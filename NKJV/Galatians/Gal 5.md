# Galatians 5

***


###### 1 
Stand[^a] fast therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and do not be entangled again with a yoke of bondage. 

###### 2 
Indeed I, Paul, say to you that if you become circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing. 

###### 3 
And I testify again to every man who becomes circumcised that he is [^b]a debtor to keep the whole law. 

###### 4 
You have become estranged from Christ, you who _attempt to_ be justified by law; you have fallen from grace. 

###### 5 
For we through the Spirit eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. 

###### 6 
For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, but faith working through love. ## Love Fulfills the Law 

###### 7 
You ran well. Who hindered you from obeying the truth? 

###### 8 
This persuasion does not _come_ from Him who calls you. 

###### 9 
A little leaven leavens the whole lump. 

###### 10 
I have confidence in you, in the Lord, that you will have no other mind; but he who troubles you shall bear his judgment, whoever he is. 

###### 11 
And I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why do I still suffer persecution? Then the offense of the cross has ceased. 

###### 12 
I could wish that those who trouble you would even [^c]cut themselves off! 

###### 13 
For you, brethren, have been called to liberty; only do not _use_ liberty as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. 

###### 14 
For all the law is fulfilled in one word, _even_ in this: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself." 

###### 15 
But if you bite and devour one another, beware lest you be consumed by one another! ## Walking in the Spirit 

###### 16 
I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. 

###### 17 
For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, so that you do not do the things that you wish. 

###### 18 
But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. 

###### 19 
Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are: [^d]adultery, [^e]fornication, uncleanness, lewdness, 

###### 20 
idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies, 

###### 21 
envy, [^f]murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like; of which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told _you_ in time past, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. 

###### 22 
But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 

###### 23 
[^g]gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law. 

###### 24 
And those _who are_ Christ's have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. 

###### 25 
If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. 

###### 26 
Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Genesis 20

***


###### 1 
And Abraham journeyed from there to the South, and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur, and stayed in Gerar. 

###### 2 
Now Abraham said of Sarah his wife, "She _is_ my sister." And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah. 

###### 3 
But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, "Indeed you _are_ a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken, for she _is_ [^a]a man's wife." 

###### 4 
But Abimelech had not come near her; and he said, "Lord, will You slay a righteous nation also? 

###### 5 
Did he not say to me, 'She _is_ my sister'? And she, even she herself said, 'He _is_ my brother.' In the [^b]integrity of my heart and innocence of my hands I have done this." 

###### 6 
And God said to him in a dream, "Yes, I know that you did this in the integrity of your heart. For I also withheld you from sinning against Me; therefore I did not let you touch her. 

###### 7 
Now therefore, restore the man's wife; for he _is_ a prophet, and he will pray for you and you shall live. But if you do not restore _her,_ know that you shall surely die, you and all who _are_ yours." 

###### 8 
So Abimelech rose early in the morning, called all his servants, and told all these things in their hearing; and the men were very much afraid. 

###### 9 
And Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, "What have you done to us? How have I [^c]offended you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You have done deeds to me that ought not to be done." 

###### 10 
Then Abimelech said to Abraham, "What did you have in view, that you have done this thing?" 

###### 11 
And Abraham said, "Because I thought, surely the fear of God _is_ not in this place; and they will kill me on account of my wife. 

###### 12 
But indeed _she is_ truly my sister. She _is_ the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife. 

###### 13 
And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said to her, 'This _is_ your kindness that you should do for me: in every place, wherever we go, say of me, "He _is_ my brother." ' " 

###### 14 
Then Abimelech took sheep, oxen, and male and female servants, and gave _them_ to Abraham; and he restored Sarah his wife to him. 

###### 15 
And Abimelech said, "See, my land _is_ before you; dwell where it pleases you." 

###### 16 
Then to Sarah he said, "Behold, I have given your brother a thousand _pieces_ of silver; indeed this [^d]vindicates you before all who _are_ with you and before everybody." Thus she was [^e]rebuked. 

###### 17 
So Abraham prayed to God; and God healed Abimelech, his wife, and his female servants. Then they bore _children;_ 

###### 18 
for the Lord had closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah, Abraham's wife. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

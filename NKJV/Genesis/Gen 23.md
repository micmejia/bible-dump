# Genesis 23

***


###### 1 
Sarah lived one hundred and twenty-seven years; _these were_ the years of the life of Sarah. 

###### 2 
So Sarah died in Kirjath Arba (that _is,_ Hebron) in the land of Canaan, and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her. 

###### 3 
Then Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spoke to the sons of Heth, saying, 

###### 4 
"I _am_ a foreigner and a visitor among you. Give me property for a burial place among you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight." 

###### 5 
And the sons of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him, 

###### 6 
"Hear us, my lord: You _are_ a [^a]mighty prince among us; bury your dead in the choicest of our burial places. None of us will withhold from you his burial place, that you may bury your dead." 

###### 7 
Then Abraham stood up and bowed himself to the people of the land, the sons of Heth. 

###### 8 
And he spoke with them, saying, "If it is your wish that I bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and [^b]meet with Ephron the son of Zohar for me, 

###### 9 
that he may give me the cave of Machpelah which he has, which _is_ at the end of his field. Let him give it to me at the full price, as property for a burial place among you." 

###### 10 
Now Ephron dwelt among the sons of Heth; and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the presence of the sons of Heth, all who entered at the gate of his city, saying, 

###### 11 
"No, my lord, hear me: I give you the field and the cave that _is_ in it; I give it to you in the presence of the sons of my people. I give it to you. Bury your dead!" 

###### 12 
Then Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land; 

###### 13 
and he spoke to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, saying, "If you _will give it,_ please hear me. I will give you money for the field; take _it_ from me and I will bury my dead there." 

###### 14 
And Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him, 

###### 15 
"My lord, listen to me; the land _is worth_ four hundred shekels of silver. What _is_ that between you and me? So bury your dead." 

###### 16 
And Abraham listened to Ephron; and Abraham weighed out the silver for Ephron which he had named in the hearing of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, currency of the merchants. 

###### 17 
So the field of Ephron which _was_ in Machpelah, which _was_ before Mamre, the field and the cave which _was_ in it, and all the trees that _were_ in the field, which _were_ within all the surrounding borders, were deeded 

###### 18 
to Abraham as a possession in the presence of the sons of Heth, before all who went in at the gate of his city. 

###### 19 
And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah, before Mamre (that _is,_ Hebron) in the land of Canaan. 

###### 20 
So the field and the cave that _is_ in it were deeded to Abraham by the sons of Heth as property for a burial place.

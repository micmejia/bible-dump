# Genesis 35

***


###### 1 
Then God said to Jacob, "Arise, go up to Bethel and dwell there; and make an altar there to God, who appeared to you when you fled from the face of Esau your brother." 

###### 2 
And Jacob said to his household and to all who _were_ with him, "Put away the foreign gods that _are_ among you, purify yourselves, and change your garments. 

###### 3 
Then let us arise and go up to Bethel; and I will make an altar there to God, who answered me in the day of my distress and has been with me in the way which I have gone." 

###### 4 
So they gave Jacob all the foreign [^a]gods which _were_ in their hands, and the earrings which _were_ in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the terebinth tree which _was_ by Shechem. 

###### 5 
And they journeyed, and the terror of God was upon the cities that _were_ all around them, and they did not pursue the sons of Jacob. 

###### 6 
So Jacob came to Luz (that _is,_ Bethel), which _is_ in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who _were_ with him. 

###### 7 
And he built an altar there and called the place [^b]El Bethel, because there God appeared to him when he fled from the face of his brother. 

###### 8 
Now Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died, and she was buried below Bethel under the terebinth tree. So the name of it was called [^c]Allon Bachuth. 

###### 9 
Then God appeared to Jacob again, when he came from Padan Aram, and blessed him. 

###### 10 
And God said to him, "Your name _is_ Jacob; your name shall not be called Jacob anymore, but Israel shall be your name." So He called his name Israel. 

###### 11 
Also God said to him: "I _am_ God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall proceed from you, and kings shall come from your body. 

###### 12 
The land which I gave Abraham and Isaac I give to you; and to your descendants after you I give this land." 

###### 13 
Then God went[^d] up from him in the place where He talked with him. 

###### 14 
So Jacob set up a pillar in the place where He talked with him, a pillar of stone; and he poured a drink offering on it, and he poured oil on it. 

###### 15 
And Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him, Bethel. ## Death of Rachel 

###### 16 
Then they journeyed from Bethel. And when there was but a little distance to go to Ephrath, Rachel labored _in childbirth,_ and she had hard labor. 

###### 17 
Now it came to pass, when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said to her, "Do not fear; you will have this son also." 

###### 18 
And so it was, as her soul was departing (for she died), that she called his name [^e]Ben-Oni; but his father called him [^f]Benjamin. 

###### 19 
So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that _is,_ Bethlehem). 

###### 20 
And Jacob set a pillar on her grave, which _is_ the pillar of Rachel's grave to this day. 

###### 21 
Then Israel journeyed and pitched his tent beyond the tower of Eder. 

###### 22 
And it happened, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine; and Israel heard _about it._ ## Jacob's Twelve Sons Now the sons of Jacob were twelve: 

###### 23 
the sons of Leah _were_ Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun; 

###### 24 
the sons of Rachel _were_ Joseph and Benjamin; 

###### 25 
the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's maidservant, _were_ Dan and Naphtali; 

###### 26 
and the sons of Zilpah, Leah's maidservant, _were_ Gad and Asher. These _were_ the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Padan Aram. ## Death of Isaac 

###### 27 
Then Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre, or Kirjath Arba[^g] (that _is,_ Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had dwelt. 

###### 28 
Now the days of Isaac were one hundred and eighty years. 

###### 29 
So Isaac breathed his last and died, and was [^h]gathered to his people, _being_ old and full of days. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

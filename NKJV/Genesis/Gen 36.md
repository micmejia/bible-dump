# Genesis 36

***


###### 1 
Now this _is_ the genealogy of Esau, who is Edom. 

###### 2 
Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite; Aholibamah[^a] the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite; 

###### 3 
and Basemath, Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth. 

###### 4 
Now Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, and Basemath bore Reuel. 

###### 5 
And [^b]Aholibamah bore Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah. These _were_ the sons of Esau who were born to him in the land of Canaan. 

###### 6 
Then Esau took his wives, his sons, his daughters, and all the persons of his household, his cattle and all his animals, and all his goods which he had gained in the land of Canaan, and went to a country away from the presence of his brother Jacob. 

###### 7 
For their possessions were too great for them to dwell together, and the land where they were strangers could not support them because of their livestock. 

###### 8 
So Esau dwelt in Mount Seir. Esau _is_ Edom. 

###### 9 
And this _is_ the genealogy of Esau the father of the Edomites in Mount Seir. 

###### 10 
These _were_ the names of Esau's sons: Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, and Reuel the son of Basemath the wife of Esau. 

###### 11 
And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, [^c]Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz. 

###### 12 
Now Timna was the concubine of Eliphaz, Esau's son, and she bore Amalek to Eliphaz. These _were_ the sons of Adah, Esau's wife. 

###### 13 
These _were_ the sons of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These were the sons of Basemath, Esau's wife. 

###### 14 
These were the sons of [^d]Aholibamah, Esau's wife, the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon. And she bore to Esau: Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah. ## The Chiefs of Edom

These _were_ the sons of Shobal: [^h]Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, [^i]Shepho, and Onam. 

###### 24 
These _were_ the sons of Zibeon: both Ajah and Anah. This _was the_ Anah who found the [^j]water in the wilderness as he pastured the donkeys of his father Zibeon. 

###### 25

Now this _is_ the genealogy of Esau, who is Edom.

Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite; Aholibamah[^a] the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite; 

###### 3 
and Basemath, Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth. 

###### 4 
Now Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, and Basemath bore Reuel. 

###### 5 
And [^b]Aholibamah bore Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah. These _were_ the sons of Esau who were born to him in the land of Canaan. 

###### 6 
Then Esau took his wives, his sons, his daughters, and all the persons of his household, his cattle and all his animals, and all his goods which he had gained in the land of Canaan, and went to a country away from the presence of his brother Jacob. 

###### 7 
For their possessions were too great for them to dwell together, and the land where they were strangers could not support them because of their livestock. 

###### 8 
So Esau dwelt in Mount Seir. Esau _is_ Edom.

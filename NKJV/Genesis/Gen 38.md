# Genesis 38

***


###### 1 
It came to pass at that time that Judah departed from his brothers, and visited a certain Adullamite whose name _was_ Hirah. 

###### 2 
And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name _was_ Shua, and he married her and went in to her. 

###### 3 
So she conceived and bore a son, and he called his name Er. 

###### 4 
She conceived again and bore a son, and she called his name Onan. 

###### 5 
And she conceived yet again and bore a son, and called his name Shelah. He was at Chezib when she bore him. 

###### 6 
Then Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name _was_ Tamar. 

###### 7 
But Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the Lord, and the Lord killed him. 

###### 8 
And Judah said to Onan, "Go in to your brother's wife and marry her, and raise up an heir to your brother." 

###### 9 
But Onan knew that the heir would not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in to his brother's wife, that he emitted on the ground, lest he should give an heir to his brother. 

###### 10 
And the thing which he did displeased the Lord; therefore He killed him also. 

###### 11 
Then Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, "Remain a widow in your father's house till my son Shelah is grown." For he said, "Lest he also die like his brothers." And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house. 

###### 12 
Now in the process of time the daughter of Shua, Judah's wife, died; and Judah was comforted, and went up to his sheepshearers at Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite. 

###### 13 
And it was told Tamar, saying, "Look, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep." 

###### 14 
So she took off her widow's garments, covered _herself_ with a veil and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place which _was_ on the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given to him as a wife. 

###### 15 
When Judah saw her, he thought she _was_ a harlot, because she had covered her face. 

###### 16 
Then he turned to her by the way, and said, "Please let me come in to you"; for he did not know that she _was_ his daughter-in-law. So she said, "What will you give me, that you may come in to me?" 

###### 17 
And he said, "I will send a young goat from the flock." So she said, "Will you give _me_ a pledge till you send _it?_" 

###### 18 
Then he said, "What pledge shall I give you?" So she said, "Your signet and cord, and your staff that _is_ in your hand." Then he gave _them_ to her, and went in to her, and she conceived by him. 

###### 19 
So she arose and went away, and laid aside her veil and put on the garments of her widowhood. 

###### 20 
And Judah sent the young goat by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive _his_ pledge from the woman's hand, but he did not find her. 

###### 21 
Then he asked the men of that place, saying, "Where is the harlot who _was_ openly by the roadside?" And they said, "There was no harlot in this _place._" 

###### 22 
So he returned to Judah and said, "I cannot find her. Also, the men of the place said there was no harlot in this _place._" 

###### 23 
Then Judah said, "Let her take _them_ for herself, lest we be shamed; for I sent this young goat and you have not found her." 

###### 24 
And it came to pass, about three months after, that Judah was told, saying, "Tamar your daughter-in-law has played the harlot; furthermore she _is_ with child by harlotry." So Judah said, "Bring her out and let her be burned!" 

###### 25 
When she _was_ brought out, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, "By the man to whom these belong, I _am_ with child." And she said, "Please determine whose these _are_--the signet and cord, and staff." 

###### 26 
So Judah acknowledged _them_ and said, "She has been more righteous than I, because I did not give her to Shelah my son." And he never knew her again. 

###### 27 
Now it came to pass, at the time for giving birth, that behold, twins _were_ in her womb. 

###### 28 
And so it was, when she was giving birth, that _the one_ put out _his_ hand; and the midwife took a scarlet _thread_ and bound it on his hand, saying, "This one came out first." 

###### 29 
Then it happened, as he drew back his hand, that his brother came out unexpectedly; and she said, "How did you break through? _This_ breach _be_ upon you!" Therefore his name was called Perez. 

###### 30 
Afterward his brother came out who had the scarlet _thread_ on his hand. And his name was called Zerah.

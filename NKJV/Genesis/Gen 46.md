So Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac. 

###### 2 
Then God spoke to Israel in the visions of the night, and said, "Jacob, Jacob!" And he said, "Here I am."

So He said, "I _am_ God, the God of your father; do not fear to go down to Egypt, for I will make of you a great nation there. 

###### 4 
I will go down with you to Egypt, and I will also surely bring you up _again;_ and Joseph [^a]will put his hand on your eyes."

###### 28 
Then he sent Judah before him to Joseph, to point out before him _the way_ to Goshen. And they came to the land of Goshen. 

###### 29 
So Joseph made ready his chariot and went up to Goshen to meet his father Israel; and he presented himself to him, and fell on his neck and wept on his neck a good while. 

###### 30 
And Israel said to Joseph, "Now let me die, since I have seen your face, because you _are_ still alive." 

###### 31 
Then Joseph said to his brothers and to his father's household, "I will go up and tell Pharaoh, and say to him, 'My brothers and those of my father's house, who _were_ in the land of Canaan, have come to me. 

###### 32 
And the men _are_ shepherds, for their occupation has been to feed livestock; and they have brought their flocks, their herds, and all that they have.' 

###### 33 
So it shall be, when Pharaoh calls you and says, 'What is your occupation?' 

###### 34 
that you shall say, 'Your servants' occupation has been with livestock from our youth even till now, both we _and_ also our fathers,' that you may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd _is_ an[^o] abomination to the Egyptians."

# Genesis 48

***


###### 1 
Now it came to pass after these things that Joseph was told, "Indeed your father _is_ sick"; and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. 

###### 2 
And Jacob was told, "Look, your son Joseph is coming to you"; and Israel [^a]strengthened himself and sat up on the bed. 

###### 3 
Then Jacob said to Joseph: "God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me, 

###### 4 
and said to me, 'Behold, I will make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will make of you a multitude of people, and give this land to your descendants after you _as_ an everlasting possession.' 

###### 5 
And now your two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, _are_ mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine. 

###### 6 
Your [^b]offspring [^c]whom you beget after them shall be yours; they will be called by the name of their brothers in their inheritance. 

###### 7 
But as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died beside me in the land of Canaan on the way, when _there was_ but a little distance to go to Ephrath; and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem)." 

###### 8 
Then Israel saw Joseph's sons, and said, "Who _are_ these?" 

###### 9 
Joseph said to his father, "They _are_ my sons, whom God has given me in this _place._" And he said, "Please bring them to me, and I will bless them." 

###### 10 
Now the eyes of Israel were dim with age, _so that_ he could not see. Then Joseph brought them near him, and he kissed them and embraced them. 

###### 11 
And Israel said to Joseph, "I had not thought to see your face; but in fact, God has also shown me your offspring!" 

###### 12 
So Joseph brought them from beside his knees, and he bowed down with his face to the earth. 

###### 13 
And Joseph took them both, Ephraim with his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh with his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought _them_ near him. 

###### 14 
Then Israel stretched out his right hand and laid _it_ on Ephraim's head, who _was_ the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh's head, guiding his hands knowingly, for Manasseh _was_ the firstborn. 

###### 15 
And he blessed Joseph, and said: "God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, The God who has fed me all my life long to this day, 

###### 16 
The Angel who has redeemed me from all evil, Bless the lads; Let my name be named upon them, And the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; And let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth." 

###### 17 
Now when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it displeased him; so he took hold of his father's hand to remove it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head. 

###### 18 
And Joseph said to his father, "Not so, my father, for this _one is_ the firstborn; put your right hand on his head." 

###### 19 
But his father refused and said, "I know, my son, I know. He also shall become a people, and he also shall be great; but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his descendants shall become a multitude of nations." 

###### 20 
So he blessed them that day, saying, "By you Israel will bless, saying, 'May God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh!' " And thus he set Ephraim before Manasseh. 

###### 21 
Then Israel said to Joseph, "Behold, I am dying, but God will be with you and bring you back to the land of your fathers. 

###### 22 
Moreover I have given to you one [^d]portion above your brothers, which I took from the hand of the Amorite with my sword and my bow."

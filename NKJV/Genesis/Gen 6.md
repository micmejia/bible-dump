# Genesis 6

***


###### 1 
Now it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born to them, 

###### 2 
that the sons of God saw the daughters of men, that they _were_ beautiful; and they took wives for themselves of all whom they chose. 

###### 3 
And the Lord said, "My Spirit shall not strive with man forever, for he _is_ indeed flesh; yet his days shall be one hundred and twenty years." 

###### 4 
There were giants on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men and they bore _children_ to them. Those _were_ the mighty men who _were_ of old, men of renown. 

###### 5 
Then the Lord saw that the wickedness of man _was_ great in the earth, and _that_ every intent of the thoughts of his heart _was_ only evil continually. 

###### 6 
And the Lord was sorry that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved in His heart. 

###### 7 
So the Lord said, "I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth, both man and beast, creeping thing and birds of the air, for I am sorry that I have made them." 

###### 8 
But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord.

## Noah Pleases God 

###### 9 
This is the genealogy of Noah. Noah was a just man, perfect in his generations. Noah walked with God. 

###### 10 
And Noah begot three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. 

###### 11 
The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence. 

###### 12 
So God looked upon the earth, and indeed it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth.

## The Ark Prepared 

###### 13 
And God said to Noah, "The end of all flesh has come before Me, for the earth is filled with violence through them; and behold, I will destroy them with the earth. 

###### 14 
Make yourself an ark of gopherwood; make rooms in the ark, and cover it inside and outside with pitch. 

###### 15 
And this is how you shall make it: The length of the ark _shall be_ three hundred cubits, its width fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits. 

###### 16 
You shall make a window for the ark, and you shall finish it to a cubit from above; and set the door of the ark in its side. You shall make it _with_ lower, second, and third _decks._ 

###### 17 
And behold, I Myself am bringing floodwaters on the earth, to destroy from under heaven all flesh in which _is_ the breath of life; everything that _is_ on the earth shall die. 

###### 18 
But I will establish My covenant with you; and you shall go into the ark--you, your sons, your wife, and your sons' wives with you. 

###### 19 
And of every living thing of all flesh you shall bring two of every _sort_ into the ark, to keep _them_ alive with you; they shall be male and female. 

###### 20 
Of the birds after their kind, of animals after their kind, and of every creeping thing of the earth after its kind, two of every _kind_ will come to you to keep _them_ alive. 

###### 21 
And you shall take for yourself of all food that is eaten, and you shall gather _it_ to yourself; and it shall be food for you and for them." 

###### 22 
Thus Noah did; according to all that God commanded him, so he did.

# Habakkuk 1

***


###### 1 
The burden which the prophet Habakkuk saw.

## The Prophet's Question 

###### 2 
O Lord, how long shall I cry, And You will not hear? Even cry out to You, "Violence!" And You will not save. 

###### 3 
Why do You show me iniquity, And cause _me_ to see trouble? For plundering and violence _are_ before me; There is strife, and contention arises. 

###### 4 
Therefore the law is powerless, And justice never goes forth. For the wicked surround the righteous; Therefore perverse judgment proceeds.

## The Lord's Reply 

###### 5 
"Look among the nations and watch-- Be utterly astounded! For _I will_ work a work in your days _Which_ you would not believe, though it were told _you._ 

###### 6 
For indeed I am raising up the Chaldeans, A bitter and hasty nation Which marches through the breadth of the earth, To possess dwelling places _that are_ not theirs. 

###### 7 
They are terrible and dreadful; Their judgment and their dignity proceed from themselves. 

###### 8 
Their horses also are swifter than leopards, And more fierce than evening wolves. Their chargers charge ahead; Their cavalry comes from afar; They fly as the eagle _that_ hastens to eat. 

###### 9 
"They all come for violence; Their faces are set _like_ the east wind. They gather captives like sand. 

###### 10 
They scoff at kings, And princes are scorned by them. They deride every stronghold, For they heap up earthen _mounds_ and seize it. 

###### 11 
Then _his_ mind changes, and he transgresses; He commits offense, _Ascribing_ this power to his god." ## The Prophet's Second Question 

###### 12 
Are You not from everlasting, O Lord my God, my Holy One? We shall not die. O Lord, You have appointed them for judgment; O Rock, You have marked them for correction. 

###### 13 
_You are_ of purer eyes than to behold evil, And cannot look on wickedness. Why do You look on those who deal treacherously, _And_ hold Your tongue when the wicked devours A _person_ more righteous than he? 

###### 14 
_Why_ do You make men like fish of the sea, Like creeping things _that have_ no ruler over them? 

###### 15 
They take up all of them with a hook, They catch them in their net, And gather them in their dragnet. Therefore they rejoice and are glad. 

###### 16 
Therefore they sacrifice to their net, And burn incense to their dragnet; Because by them their share _is_ sumptuous And their food plentiful. 

###### 17 
Shall they therefore empty their net, And continue to slay nations without pity?

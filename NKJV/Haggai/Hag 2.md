# Haggai 2

***


###### 1 
In the seventh _month,_ on the twenty-first of the month, the word of the Lord came [^a]by Haggai the prophet, saying: 

###### 2 
"Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, saying: 

###### 3 
'Who is left among you who saw this [^b]temple in its former glory? And how do you see it now? In comparison with it, _is this_ not in your eyes as nothing? 

###### 4 
Yet now be strong, Zerubbabel,' says the Lord; 'and be strong, Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest; and be strong, all you people of the land,' says the Lord, 'and work; for I _am_ with you,' says the Lord of hosts. 

###### 5 
'_According to_ the word that I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt, so My Spirit remains among you; do not fear!' 

###### 6 
"For thus says the Lord of hosts: 'Once more (it _is_ a little while) I will shake heaven and earth, the sea and dry land; 

###### 7 
and I will shake all nations, and they shall come to the [^c]Desire of All Nations, and I will fill this [^d]temple with glory,' says the Lord of hosts. 

###### 8 
'The silver _is_ Mine, and the gold _is_ Mine,' says the Lord of hosts. 

###### 9 
'The glory of this latter [^e]temple shall be greater than the former,' says the Lord of hosts. 'And in this place I will give peace,' says the Lord of hosts." ## The People Are Defiled 

###### 10 
On the twenty-fourth _day_ of the ninth _month,_ in the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came by Haggai the prophet, saying, 

###### 11 
"Thus says the Lord of hosts: 'Now, ask the priests _concerning the_ law, saying, 

###### 12 
"If one carries holy meat in the fold of his garment, and with the edge he touches bread or stew, wine or oil, or any food, will it become holy?" ' " Then the priests answered and said, "No." 

###### 13 
And Haggai said, "If _one who is_ unclean _because_ of a dead body touches any of these, will it be unclean?" So the priests answered and said, "It shall be unclean." 

###### 14 
Then Haggai answered and said, " 'So is this people, and so is this nation before Me,' says the Lord, 'and so is every work of their hands; and what they offer there is unclean. ## Promised Blessing 

###### 15 
'And now, carefully consider from this day forward: from before stone was laid upon stone in the temple of the Lord-- 

###### 16 
since those _days,_ when _one_ came to a heap of twenty ephahs, there were _but_ ten; when _one_ came to the wine vat to draw out fifty baths from the press, there were _but_ twenty. 

###### 17 
I struck you with blight and mildew and hail in all the labors of your hands; yet you did not _turn_ to Me,' says the Lord. 

###### 18 
'Consider now from this day forward, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, from the day that the foundation of the Lord's temple was laid--consider it: 

###### 19 
Is the seed still in the barn? As yet the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate, and the olive tree have not yielded _fruit. But_ from this day I will bless _you._' " ## Zerubbabel Chosen as a Signet 

###### 20 
And again the word of the Lord came to Haggai on the twenty-fourth day of the month, saying, 

###### 21 
"Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying: 'I will shake heaven and earth. 

###### 22 
I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms; I will destroy the strength of the Gentile kingdoms. I will overthrow the chariots And those who ride in them; The horses and their riders shall come down, Every one by the sword of his brother. 

###### 23 
'In that day,' says the Lord of hosts, 'I will take you, Zerubbabel My servant, the son of Shealtiel,' says the Lord, 'and will make you like a signet _ring;_ for I have chosen you,' says the Lord of hosts."

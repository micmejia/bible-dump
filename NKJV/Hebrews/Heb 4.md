# Hebrews 4

***


###### 1 
Therefore, since a promise remains of entering His rest, let us fear lest any of you seem to have come short of it. 

###### 2 
For indeed the gospel was preached to us as well as to them; but the word which they heard did not profit them, [^a]not being mixed with faith in those who heard _it._ 

###### 3 
For we who have believed do enter that rest, as He has said: "So I swore in My wrath, 'They shall not enter My rest,' " although the works were finished from the foundation of the world. 

###### 4 
For He has spoken in a certain place of the seventh _day_ in this way: "And God rested on the seventh day from all His works"; 

###### 5 
and again in this _place:_ "They shall not enter My rest." 

###### 6 
Since therefore it remains that some _must_ enter it, and those to whom it was first preached did not enter because of disobedience, 

###### 7 
again He designates a certain day, saying in David, "Today," after such a long time, as it has been said: "Today, if you will hear His voice, Do not harden your hearts." 

###### 8 
For if [^b]Joshua had given them rest, then He would not afterward have spoken of another day. 

###### 9 
There remains therefore a rest for the people of God. 

###### 10 
For he who has entered His rest has himself also ceased from his works as God _did_ from His. ## The Word Discovers Our Condition 

###### 11 
Let us therefore be diligent to enter that rest, lest anyone fall according to the same example of disobedience. 

###### 12 
For the word of God _is_ living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. 

###### 13 
And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things _are_ naked and open to the eyes of Him to whom we _must give_ account. ## Our Compassionate High Priest 

###### 14 
Seeing then that we have a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast _our_ confession. 

###### 15 
For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all _points_ tempted as _we are,_ _yet_ without sin. 

###### 16 
Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Hosea 11

***


###### 1 
"When Israel _was_ a child, I loved him, And out of Egypt I called My son. 

###### 2 
_As_ they called them, So they went from them; They sacrificed to the Baals, And burned incense to carved images. 

###### 3 
"I taught Ephraim to walk, Taking them by their arms; But they did not know that I healed them. 

###### 4 
I drew them with gentle cords, With bands of love, And I was to them as those who take the yoke from their neck. I stooped _and_ fed them. 

###### 5 
"He shall not return to the land of Egypt; But the Assyrian shall be his king, Because they refused to repent. 

###### 6 
And the sword shall slash in his cities, Devour his districts, And consume _them,_ Because of their own counsels. 

###### 7 
My people are bent on backsliding from Me. Though they call to the Most High, None at all exalt _Him._ 

###### 8 
"How can I give you up, Ephraim? _How_ can I hand you over, Israel? How can I make you like Admah? _How_ can I set you like Zeboiim? My heart churns within Me; My sympathy is stirred. 

###### 9 
I will not execute the fierceness of My anger; I will not again destroy Ephraim. For I _am_ God, and not man, The Holy One in your midst; And I will not come with terror. 

###### 10 
"They shall walk after the Lord. He will roar like a lion. When He roars, Then _His_ sons shall come trembling from the west; 

###### 11 
They shall come trembling like a bird from Egypt, Like a dove from the land of Assyria. And I will let them dwell in their houses," Says the Lord. ## God's Charge Against Ephraim 

###### 12 
"Ephraim has encircled Me with lies, And the house of Israel with deceit; But Judah still walks with God, Even with the Holy One _who is_ faithful.

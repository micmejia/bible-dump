# Hosea 12

***


###### 1 
"Ephraim feeds on the wind, And pursues the east wind; He daily increases lies and [^a]desolation. Also they make a [^b]covenant with the Assyrians, And oil is carried to Egypt. 

###### 2 
"The Lord also _brings_ a [^c]charge against Judah, And will punish Jacob according to his ways; According to his deeds He will recompense him. 

###### 3 
He took his brother by the heel in the womb, And in his strength he struggled with God. 

###### 4 
Yes, he struggled with the Angel and prevailed; He wept, and sought favor from Him. He found Him _in_ Bethel, And there He spoke to us-- 

###### 5 
That is, the Lord God of hosts. The Lord _is_ His memorable name. 

###### 6 
So you, by _the help of_ your God, return; Observe mercy and justice, And wait on your God continually. 

###### 7 
"A cunning [^d]Canaanite! Deceitful scales _are_ in his hand; He loves to oppress. 

###### 8 
And Ephraim said, 'Surely I have become rich, I have found wealth for myself; _In_ all my labors They shall find in me no iniquity that _is_ sin.' 

###### 9 
"But I _am_ the Lord your God, Ever since the land of Egypt; I will again make you dwell in tents, As in the days of the appointed feast. 

###### 10 
I have also spoken by the prophets, And have multiplied visions; I have given [^e]symbols [^f]through the witness of the prophets." 

###### 11 
Though Gilead _has_ idols-- Surely they are [^g]vanity-- Though they sacrifice bulls in Gilgal, Indeed their altars _shall be_ heaps in the furrows of the field. 

###### 12 
Jacob fled to the country of Syria; Israel served for a spouse, And for a wife he tended _sheep._ 

###### 13 
By a prophet the Lord brought Israel out of Egypt, And by a prophet he was preserved. 

###### 14 
Ephraim provoked _Him_ to anger most bitterly; Therefore his Lord will leave the guilt of his bloodshed upon him, And return his reproach upon him.

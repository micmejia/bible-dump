# Hosea 14

***


###### 1 
O Israel, return to the Lord your God, For you have stumbled because of your iniquity; 

###### 2 
Take words with you, And return to the Lord. Say to Him, "Take away all iniquity; Receive _us_ graciously, For we will offer the sacrifices[^a] of our lips. 

###### 3 
Assyria shall not save us, We will not ride on horses, Nor will we say anymore to the work of our hands, '_You are_ our gods.' For in You the fatherless finds mercy." 

###### 4 
"I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely, For My anger has turned away from him. 

###### 5 
I will be like the dew to Israel; He shall [^b]grow like the lily, And [^c]lengthen his roots like Lebanon. 

###### 6 
His branches shall [^d]spread; His beauty shall be like an olive tree, And his fragrance like Lebanon. 

###### 7 
Those who dwell under his shadow shall return; They shall be revived _like_ grain, And [^e]grow like a vine. Their [^f]scent _shall be_ like the wine of Lebanon. 

###### 8 
"Ephraim _shall say,_ 'What have I to do anymore with idols?' I have heard and observed him. I _am_ like a green cypress tree; Your fruit is found in Me." 

###### 9 
Who _is_ wise? Let him understand these things. _Who is_ prudent? Let him know them. For the ways of the Lord _are_ right; The righteous walk in them, But transgressors stumble in them. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Hosea 3

***


###### 1 
Then the Lord said to me, "Go again, love a woman _who is_ loved by a lover and is committing adultery, just like the love of the Lord for the children of Israel, who look to other gods and love _the_ raisin cakes _of the pagans._" 

###### 2 
So I bought her for myself for fifteen _shekels_ of silver, and one and one-half homers of barley. 

###### 3 
And I said to her, "You shall stay with me many days; you shall not play the harlot, nor shall you have a man--so, too, _will_ I _be_ toward you." 

###### 4 
For the children of Israel shall abide many days without king or prince, without sacrifice or _sacred_ pillar, without ephod or teraphim. 

###### 5 
Afterward the children of Israel shall return and seek the Lord their God and David their king. They shall fear the Lord and His goodness in the latter days.

# Hosea 6

***


###### 1 
Come, and let us return to the Lord; For He has torn, but He will heal us; He has stricken, but He will [^a]bind us up. 

###### 2 
After two days He will revive us; On the third day He will raise us up, That we may live in His sight. 

###### 3 
Let us know, Let us pursue the knowledge of the Lord. His going forth is established as the morning; He will come to us like the rain, Like the latter _and_ former rain to the earth. ## Impenitence of Israel and Judah 

###### 4 
"O Ephraim, what shall I do to you? O Judah, what shall I do to you? For your faithfulness is like a morning cloud, And like the early dew it goes away. 

###### 5 
Therefore I have hewn _them_ by the prophets, I have slain them by the words of My mouth; And [^b]your judgments _are like_ light _that_ goes forth. 

###### 6 
For I desire mercy[^c] and not sacrifice, And the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings. 

###### 7 
"But like [^d]men they transgressed the covenant; There they dealt treacherously with Me. 

###### 8 
Gilead _is_ a city of evildoers _And_ [^e]defiled with blood. 

###### 9 
As bands of robbers lie in wait for a man, _So_ the company of priests murder on the way to Shechem; Surely they commit lewdness. 

###### 10 
I have seen a horrible thing in the house of Israel: There _is_ the [^f]harlotry of Ephraim; Israel is defiled. 

###### 11 
Also, O Judah, a harvest is appointed for you, When I return the captives of My people.

# Hosea 8

***


###### 1 
"_Set_ the trumpet to your mouth! _He shall come_ like an eagle against the house of the Lord, Because they have transgressed My covenant And rebelled against My law. 

###### 2 
Israel will cry to Me, 'My God, we know You!' 

###### 3 
Israel has rejected the good; The enemy will pursue him. 

###### 4 
"They set up kings, but not by Me; They made princes, but I did not acknowledge _them._ From their silver and gold They made idols for themselves-- That they might be cut off. 

###### 5 
Your calf is rejected, O Samaria! My anger is aroused against them-- How long until they attain to innocence? 

###### 6 
For from Israel _is_ even this: A workman made it, and it _is_ not God; But the calf of Samaria shall be broken to pieces. 

###### 7 
"They sow the wind, And reap the whirlwind. The stalk has no bud; It shall never produce meal. If it should produce, Aliens would swallow it up. 

###### 8 
Israel is swallowed up; Now they are among the Gentiles Like a vessel in which _is_ no pleasure. 

###### 9 
For they have gone up to Assyria, _Like_ a wild donkey alone by itself; Ephraim has hired lovers. 

###### 10 
Yes, though they have hired among the nations, Now I will gather them; And they shall sorrow a little, Because of the burden of the king of princes. 

###### 11 
"Because Ephraim has made many altars for sin, They have become for him altars for sinning. 

###### 12 
I have written for him the great things of My law, _But_ they were considered a strange thing. 

###### 13 
_For_ the sacrifices of My offerings they sacrifice flesh and eat _it,_ _But_ the Lord does not accept them. Now He will remember their iniquity and punish their sins. They shall return to Egypt. 

###### 14 
"For Israel has forgotten his Maker, And has built temples; Judah also has multiplied fortified cities; But I will send fire upon his cities, And it shall devour his palaces."

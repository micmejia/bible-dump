# Hosea 9

***


###### 1 
Do not rejoice, O Israel, with joy like _other_ peoples, For you have played the harlot against your God. You have made love _for_ hire on every threshing floor. 

###### 2 
The threshing floor and the winepress Shall not feed them, And the new wine shall fail in her. 

###### 3 
They shall not dwell in the Lord's land, But Ephraim shall return to Egypt, And shall eat unclean _things_ in Assyria. 

###### 4 
They shall not offer wine _offerings_ to the Lord, Nor shall their sacrifices be pleasing to Him. _It shall be_ like bread of mourners to them; All who eat it shall be defiled. For their bread _shall be_ for their _own_ life; It shall not come into the house of the Lord. 

###### 5 
What will you do in the appointed day, And in the day of the feast of the Lord? 

###### 6 
For indeed they are gone because of destruction. Egypt shall gather them up; Memphis shall bury them. Nettles shall possess their valuables of silver; Thorns _shall be_ in their tents. 

###### 7 
The days of punishment have come; The days of recompense have come. Israel knows! The prophet _is_ a fool, The spiritual man _is_ insane, Because of the greatness of your iniquity and great enmity. 

###### 8 
The watchman of Ephraim _is_ with my God; But the prophet _is_ a [^a]fowler's snare in all his ways-- Enmity in the house of his God. 

###### 9 
They are deeply corrupted, As in the days of Gibeah. He will remember their iniquity; He will punish their sins. 

###### 10 
"I found Israel Like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers As the firstfruits on the fig tree in its first season. _But_ they went to Baal Peor, And [^b]separated themselves _to that_ shame; They became an abomination like the thing they loved. 

###### 11 
_As for_ Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird-- No birth, no pregnancy, and no conception! 

###### 12 
Though they bring up their children, Yet I will bereave them to the last man. Yes, woe to them when I depart from them! 

###### 13 
Just as I saw Ephraim like Tyre, planted in a pleasant place, So Ephraim will bring out his children to the murderer." 

###### 14 
Give them, O Lord-- What will You give? Give them a miscarrying womb And dry breasts! 

###### 15 
"All their wickedness _is_ in Gilgal, For there I hated them. Because of the evil of their deeds I will drive them from My house; I will love them no more. All their princes _are_ rebellious. 

###### 16 
Ephraim is stricken, Their root is dried up; They shall bear no fruit. Yes, were they to bear children, I would kill the darlings of their womb." 

###### 17 
My God will cast them away, Because they did not obey Him; And they shall be wanderers among the nations. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

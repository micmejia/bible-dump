# Isaiah 1

***


###### 1 
The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, _and_ Hezekiah, kings of Judah. ## The Wickedness of Judah 

###### 2 
Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth! For the Lord has spoken: "I have nourished and brought up children, And they have rebelled against Me; 

###### 3 
The ox knows its owner And the donkey its master's [^a]crib; _But_ Israel does not know, My people do not [^b]consider." 

###### 4 
Alas, sinful nation, A people [^c]laden with iniquity, A [^d]brood of evildoers, Children who are corrupters! They have forsaken the Lord, They have provoked to anger The Holy One of Israel, They have turned away backward. 

###### 5 
Why should you be stricken again? You will revolt more and more. The whole head is sick, And the whole heart faints. 

###### 6 
From the sole of the foot even to the head, _There is_ no soundness in it, _But_ wounds and bruises and putrefying sores; They have not been closed or bound up, Or soothed with ointment. 

###### 7 
Your country _is_ desolate, Your cities _are_ burned with fire; Strangers devour your land in your presence; And _it is_ desolate, as overthrown by strangers. 

###### 8 
So the daughter of Zion is left as a [^e]booth in a vineyard, As a hut in a garden of cucumbers, As a besieged city. 

###### 9 
Unless the Lord of hosts Had left to us a very small remnant, We would have become like Sodom, We would have been made like Gomorrah. 

###### 10 
Hear the word of the Lord, You rulers of Sodom; Give ear to the law of our God, You people of Gomorrah: 

###### 11 
"To what purpose _is_ the multitude of your sacrifices to Me?" Says the Lord. "I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams And the fat of fed cattle. I do not delight in the blood of bulls, Or of lambs or goats. 

###### 12 
"When you come to appear before Me, Who has required this from your hand, To trample My courts? 

###### 13 
Bring no more futile[^f] sacrifices; Incense is an abomination to Me. The New Moons, the Sabbaths, and the calling of assemblies-- I cannot endure iniquity and the sacred meeting. 

###### 14 
Your New Moons and your appointed feasts My soul hates; They are a trouble to Me, I am weary of bearing _them._ 

###### 15 
When you [^g]spread out your hands, I will hide My eyes from you; Even though you make many prayers, I will not hear. Your hands are full of [^h]blood. 

###### 16 
"Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean; Put away the evil of your doings from before My eyes. Cease to do evil, 

###### 17 
Learn to do good; Seek justice, Rebuke [^i]the oppressor; [^j]Defend the fatherless, Plead for the widow. 

###### 18 
"Come now, and let us reason together," Says the Lord, "Though your sins are like scarlet, They shall be as white as snow; Though they are red like crimson, They shall be as wool. 

###### 19 
If you are willing and obedient, You shall eat the good of the land; 

###### 20 
But if you refuse and rebel, You shall be devoured by the sword"; For the mouth of the Lord has spoken. ## The Degenerate City 

###### 21 
How the faithful city has become a [^k]harlot! It was full of justice; Righteousness lodged in it, But now murderers. 

###### 22 
Your silver has become dross, Your wine mixed with water. 

###### 23 
Your princes _are_ rebellious, And companions of thieves; Everyone loves bribes, And follows after rewards. They do not defend the fatherless, Nor does the cause of the widow come before them. 

###### 24 
Therefore the Lord says, The Lord of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel, "Ah, I will [^l]rid Myself of My adversaries, And [^m]take vengeance on My enemies. 

###### 25 
I will turn My hand against you, And thoroughly[^n] purge away your dross, And take away all your alloy. 

###### 26 
I will restore your judges as at the first, And your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you shall be called the city of righteousness, the faithful city." 

###### 27 
Zion shall be redeemed with justice, And her [^o]penitents with righteousness. 

###### 28 
The destruction of transgressors and of sinners _shall be_ together, And those who forsake the Lord shall be consumed. 

###### 29 
For [^p]they shall be ashamed of the [^q]terebinth trees Which you have desired; And you shall be embarrassed because of the gardens Which you have chosen. 

###### 30 
For you shall be as a terebinth whose leaf fades, And as a garden that has no water. 

###### 31 
The strong shall be as tinder, And the work of it as a spark; Both will burn together, And no one shall quench _them._

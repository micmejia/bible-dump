***


###### 1 
And in that day you will say: "O Lord, I will praise You; Though You were angry with me, Your anger is turned away, and You comfort me. 

###### 2 
Behold, God _is_ my salvation, I will trust and not be afraid; 'For Yah, the Lord, _is_ my strength and song; He also has become my salvation.' " 

###### 3 
Therefore with joy you will draw water From the wells of salvation. 

###### 4 
And in that day you will say: "Praise the Lord, call upon His name; Declare His deeds among the peoples, Make mention that His name is exalted. 

###### 5 
Sing to the Lord, For He has done excellent things; This _is_ known in all the earth. 

###### 6 
Cry out and shout, O inhabitant of Zion, For great _is_ the Holy One of Israel in your midst!"

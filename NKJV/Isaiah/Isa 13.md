# Isaiah 13

***


###### 1 
The burden[^a] against Babylon which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw. 

###### 2 
"Lift up a banner on the high mountain, Raise your voice to them; Wave your hand, that they may enter the gates of the nobles. 

###### 3 
I have commanded My [^b]sanctified ones; I have also called My mighty ones for My anger-- Those who rejoice in My exaltation." 

###### 4 
The noise of a multitude in the mountains, Like that of many people! A tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together! The Lord of hosts musters The army for battle. 

###### 5 
They come from a far country, From the end of heaven-- The Lord and His [^c]weapons of indignation, To destroy the whole land. 

###### 6 
Wail, for the day of the Lord _is_ at hand! It will come as destruction from the Almighty. 

###### 7 
Therefore all hands will be limp, Every man's heart will melt, 

###### 8 
And they will be afraid. Pangs[^d] and sorrows will take hold of _them;_ They will be in pain as a woman in childbirth; They will be amazed at one another; Their faces _will be like_ flames. 

###### 9 
Behold, the day of the Lord comes, Cruel, with both wrath and fierce anger, To lay the land desolate; And He will destroy its sinners from it. 

###### 10 
For the stars of heaven and their constellations Will not give their light; The sun will be darkened in its going forth, And the moon will not cause its light to shine. 

###### 11 
"I will punish the world for _its_ evil, And the wicked for their iniquity; I will halt the arrogance of the proud, And will lay low the haughtiness of the [^e]terrible. 

###### 12 
I will make a mortal more rare than fine gold, A man more than the golden wedge of Ophir. 

###### 13 
Therefore I will shake the heavens, And the earth will move out of her place, In the wrath of the Lord of hosts And in the day of His fierce anger. 

###### 14 
It shall be as the hunted gazelle, And as a sheep that no man [^f]takes up; Every man will turn to his own people, And everyone will flee to his own land. 

###### 15 
Everyone who is found will be thrust through, And everyone who is captured will fall by the sword. 

###### 16 
Their children also will be dashed to pieces before their eyes; Their houses will be plundered And their wives ravished. 

###### 17 
"Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, Who will not [^g]regard silver; And _as for_ gold, they will not delight in it. 

###### 18 
Also _their_ bows will dash the young men to pieces, And they will have no pity on the fruit of the womb; Their eye will not spare children. 

###### 19 
And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, The beauty of the Chaldeans' pride, Will be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. 

###### 20 
It will never be inhabited, Nor will it be settled from generation to generation; Nor will the Arabian pitch tents there, Nor will the shepherds make their sheepfolds there. 

###### 21 
But wild beasts of the desert will lie there, And their houses will be full of [^h]owls; Ostriches will dwell there, And wild goats will caper there. 

###### 22 
The hyenas will howl in their citadels, And jackals in their pleasant palaces. Her time _is_ near to come, And her days will not be prolonged." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

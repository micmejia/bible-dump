# Isaiah 17

***


###### 1 
The burden[^a] against Damascus. "Behold, Damascus will cease from _being_ a city, And it will be a ruinous heap. 

###### 2 
[^b]The cities of Aroer _are_ forsaken; They will be for flocks Which lie down, and no one will make _them_ afraid. 

###### 3 
The fortress also will cease from Ephraim, The kingdom from Damascus, And the remnant of Syria; They will be as the glory of the children of Israel," Says the Lord of hosts. 

###### 4 
"In that day it shall come to pass _That_ the glory of Jacob will [^c]wane, And the fatness of his flesh grow lean. 

###### 5 
It shall be as when the harvester gathers the grain, And reaps the heads with his arm; It shall be as he who gathers heads of grain In the Valley of Rephaim. 

###### 6 
Yet gleaning grapes will be left in it, Like the shaking of an olive tree, Two _or_ three olives at the top of the uppermost bough, Four _or_ five in its most fruitful branches," Says the Lord God of Israel. 

###### 7 
In that day a man will look to his Maker, And his eyes will have respect for the Holy One of Israel. 

###### 8 
He will not look to the altars, The work of his hands; He will not respect what his fingers have made, Nor the [^d]wooden images nor the incense altars. 

###### 9 
In that day his strong cities will be as a forsaken [^e]bough And [^f]an uppermost branch, Which they left because of the children of Israel; And there will be desolation. 

###### 10 
Because you have forgotten the God of your salvation, And have not been mindful of the Rock of your [^g]stronghold, Therefore you will plant pleasant plants And set out foreign seedlings; 

###### 11 
In the day you will make your plant to grow, And in the morning you will make your seed to flourish; _But_ the harvest _will be_ a heap of ruins In the day of grief and desperate sorrow. 

###### 12 
Woe to the multitude of many people _Who_ make a noise like the roar of the seas, And to the rushing of nations _That_ make a rushing like the rushing of mighty waters! 

###### 13 
The nations will rush like the rushing of many waters; But _God_ will rebuke them and they will flee far away, And be chased like the chaff of the mountains before the wind, Like a rolling thing before the whirlwind. 

###### 14 
Then behold, at eventide, trouble! _And_ before the morning, he _is_ no more. This _is_ the portion of those who plunder us, And the lot of those who rob us. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

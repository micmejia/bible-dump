# Isaiah 17

***


###### 1 
The burden against Damascus. "Behold, Damascus will cease from _being_ a city, And it will be a ruinous heap. 

###### 2 
The cities of Aroer _are_ forsaken; They will be for flocks Which lie down, and no one will make _them_ afraid. 

###### 3 
The fortress also will cease from Ephraim, The kingdom from Damascus, And the remnant of Syria; They will be as the glory of the children of Israel," Says the Lord of hosts. 

###### 4 
"In that day it shall come to pass _That_ the glory of Jacob will wane, And the fatness of his flesh grow lean. 

###### 5 
It shall be as when the harvester gathers the grain, And reaps the heads with his arm; It shall be as he who gathers heads of grain In the Valley of Rephaim. 

###### 6 
Yet gleaning grapes will be left in it, Like the shaking of an olive tree, Two _or_ three olives at the top of the uppermost bough, Four _or_ five in its most fruitful branches," Says the Lord God of Israel. 

###### 7 
In that day a man will look to his Maker, And his eyes will have respect for the Holy One of Israel. 

###### 8 
He will not look to the altars, The work of his hands; He will not respect what his fingers have made, Nor the wooden images nor the incense altars. 

###### 9 
In that day his strong cities will be as a forsaken bough And an uppermost branch, Which they left because of the children of Israel; And there will be desolation. 

###### 10 
Because you have forgotten the God of your salvation, And have not been mindful of the Rock of your stronghold, Therefore you will plant pleasant plants And set out foreign seedlings; 

###### 11 
In the day you will make your plant to grow, And in the morning you will make your seed to flourish; _But_ the harvest _will be_ a heap of ruins In the day of grief and desperate sorrow. 

###### 12 
Woe to the multitude of many people _Who_ make a noise like the roar of the seas, And to the rushing of nations _That_ make a rushing like the rushing of mighty waters! 

###### 13 
The nations will rush like the rushing of many waters; But _God_ will rebuke them and they will flee far away, And be chased like the chaff of the mountains before the wind, Like a rolling thing before the whirlwind. 

###### 14 
Then behold, at eventide, trouble! _And_ before the morning, he _is_ no more. This _is_ the portion of those who plunder us, And the lot of those who rob us.

# Isaiah 18

***


###### 1 
Woe to the land shadowed with buzzing wings, Which _is_ beyond the rivers of Ethiopia, 

###### 2 
Which sends ambassadors by sea, Even in vessels of reed on the waters, _saying,_ "Go, swift messengers, to a nation tall and smooth _of skin,_ To a people terrible from their beginning onward, A nation powerful and treading down, Whose land the rivers divide." 

###### 3 
All inhabitants of the world and dwellers on the earth: When he lifts up a banner on the mountains, you see _it;_ And when he blows a trumpet, you hear _it._ 

###### 4 
For so the Lord said to me, "I will take My rest, And I will look from My dwelling place Like clear heat in sunshine, Like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest." 

###### 5 
For before the harvest, when the bud is perfect And the sour grape is ripening in the flower, He will both cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks And take away _and_ cut down the branches. 

###### 6 
They will be left together for the mountain birds of prey And for the beasts of the earth; The birds of prey will summer on them, And all the beasts of the earth will winter on them. 

###### 7 
In that time a present will be brought to the Lord of hosts From a people tall and smooth _of skin,_ And from a people terrible from their beginning onward, A nation powerful and treading down, Whose land the rivers divide-- To the place of the name of the Lord of hosts, To Mount Zion.

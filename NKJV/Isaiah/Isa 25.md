# Isaiah 25

***


###### 1 
O Lord, You _are_ my God. I will exalt You, I will praise Your name, For You have done wonderful _things;_ _Your_ counsels of old _are_ faithfulness _and_ truth. 

###### 2 
For You have made a city a ruin, A fortified city a ruin, A palace of foreigners to be a city no more; It will never be rebuilt. 

###### 3 
Therefore the strong people will glorify You; The city of the [^a]terrible nations will fear You. 

###### 4 
For You have been a strength to the poor, A strength to the needy in his distress, A refuge from the storm, A shade from the heat; For the blast of the terrible ones _is_ as a storm _against_ the wall. 

###### 5 
You will reduce the noise of aliens, As heat in a dry place; _As_ heat in the shadow of a cloud, The song of the terrible ones will be [^b]diminished. 

###### 6 
And in this mountain The Lord of hosts will make for all people A feast of [^c]choice pieces, A feast of [^d]wines on the lees, Of fat things full of marrow, Of well-refined wines on the lees. 

###### 7 
And He will destroy on this mountain The surface of the covering cast over all people, And the veil that is spread over all nations. 

###### 8 
He will swallow up death forever, And the Lord God will wipe away tears from all faces; The rebuke of His people He will take away from all the earth; For the Lord has spoken. 

###### 9 
And it will be said in that day: "Behold, this _is_ our God; We have waited for Him, and He will save us. This _is_ the Lord; We have waited for Him; We will be glad and rejoice in His salvation." 

###### 10 
For on this mountain the hand of the Lord will rest, And Moab shall be trampled down under Him, As straw is trampled down for the refuse heap. 

###### 11 
And He will spread out His hands in their midst As a swimmer reaches out to swim, And He will bring down their pride Together with the trickery of their hands. 

###### 12 
The fortress of the high fort of your walls He will bring down, lay low, _And_ bring to the ground, down to the dust. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

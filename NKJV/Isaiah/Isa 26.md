# Isaiah 26

***


###### 1 
In that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah: "We have a strong city; _God_ will appoint salvation _for_ walls and bulwarks. 

###### 2 
Open the gates, That the righteous nation which keeps the truth may enter in. 

###### 3 
You will keep _him_ in perfect peace, _Whose_ mind _is_ stayed _on You,_ Because he trusts in You. 

###### 4 
Trust in the Lord forever, For in Yah, the Lord, _is_ everlasting strength. 

###### 5 
For He brings down those who dwell on high, The lofty city; He lays it low, He lays it low to the ground, He brings it down to the dust. 

###### 6 
The foot shall tread it down-- The feet of the poor _And_ the steps of the needy." 

###### 7 
The way of the just _is_ uprightness; O Most Upright, You weigh the path of the just. 

###### 8 
Yes, in the way of Your judgments, O Lord, we have waited for You; The desire of _our_ soul _is_ for Your name And for the remembrance of You. 

###### 9 
With my soul I have desired You in the night, Yes, by my spirit within me I will seek You early; For when Your judgments _are_ in the earth, The inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness. 

###### 10 
Let grace be shown to the wicked, _Yet_ he will not learn righteousness; In the land of uprightness he will deal unjustly, And will not behold the majesty of the Lord. 

###### 11 
Lord, _when_ Your hand is lifted up, they will not see. But they will see and be ashamed For _their_ envy of people; Yes, the fire of Your enemies shall devour them. 

###### 12 
Lord, You will establish peace for us, For You have also done all our works in us. 

###### 13 
O Lord our God, masters besides You Have had dominion over us; _But_ by You only we make mention of Your name. 

###### 14 
_They are_ dead, they will not live; _They are_ deceased, they will not rise. Therefore You have punished and destroyed them, And made all their memory to perish. 

###### 15 
You have increased the nation, O Lord, You have increased the nation; You are glorified; You have expanded all the borders of the land. 

###### 16 
Lord, in trouble they have visited You, They poured out a prayer _when_ Your chastening _was_ upon them. 

###### 17 
As a woman with child Is in pain and cries out in her pangs, _When_ she draws near the time of her delivery, So have we been in Your sight, O Lord. 

###### 18 
We have been with child, we have been in pain; We have, as it were, brought forth wind; We have not accomplished any deliverance in the earth, Nor have the inhabitants of the world fallen. 

###### 19 
Your dead shall live; _Together with_ my dead body they shall arise. Awake and sing, you who dwell in dust; For your dew _is like_ the dew of herbs, And the earth shall cast out the dead.

## Take Refuge from the Coming Judgment 

###### 20 
Come, my people, enter your chambers, And shut your doors behind you; Hide yourself, as it were, for a little moment, Until the indignation is past. 

###### 21 
For behold, the Lord comes out of His place To punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity; The earth will also disclose her blood, And will no more cover her slain.

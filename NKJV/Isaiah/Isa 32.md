# Isaiah 32

***


###### 1 
Behold, a king will reign in righteousness, And princes will rule with justice. 

###### 2 
A man will be as a hiding place from the wind, And a [^a]cover from the tempest, As rivers of water in a dry place, As the shadow of a great rock in a weary land. 

###### 3 
The eyes of those who see will not be dim, And the ears of those who hear will listen. 

###### 4 
Also the heart of the [^b]rash will understand knowledge, And the tongue of the stammerers will be ready to speak plainly. 

###### 5 
The foolish person will no longer be called [^c]generous, Nor the miser said _to be_ bountiful; 

###### 6 
For the foolish person will speak foolishness, And his heart will work iniquity: To practice ungodliness, To utter error against the Lord, To keep the hungry unsatisfied, And he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail. 

###### 7 
Also the schemes of the schemer _are_ evil; He devises wicked plans To destroy the poor with lying words, Even when the needy speaks justice. 

###### 8 
But a [^d]generous man devises generous things, And by generosity he shall stand. ## Consequences of Complacency 

###### 9 
Rise up, you women who are at ease, Hear my voice; You complacent daughters, Give ear to my speech. 

###### 10 
In a year and _some_ days You will be troubled, you complacent women; For the vintage will fail, The gathering will not come. 

###### 11 
Tremble, you _women_ who are at ease; Be troubled, you complacent ones; Strip yourselves, make yourselves bare, And gird _sackcloth_ on _your_ waists. 

###### 12 
People shall mourn upon their breasts For the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine. 

###### 13 
On the land of my people will come up thorns _and_ briers, Yes, on all the happy homes _in_ the joyous city; 

###### 14 
Because the palaces will be forsaken, The bustling city will be deserted. The forts and towers will become lairs forever, A joy of wild donkeys, a pasture of flocks-- 

###### 15 
Until the Spirit is poured upon us from on high, And the wilderness becomes a fruitful field, And the fruitful field is counted as a forest. ## The Peace of God's Reign 

###### 16 
Then justice will dwell in the wilderness, And righteousness remain in the fruitful field. 

###### 17 
The work of righteousness will be peace, And the effect of righteousness, quietness and assurance forever. 

###### 18 
My people will dwell in a peaceful habitation, In secure dwellings, and in quiet resting places, 

###### 19 
Though hail comes down on the forest, And the city is brought low in humiliation. 

###### 20 
Blessed _are_ you who sow beside all waters, Who send out freely the feet of the ox and the donkey. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

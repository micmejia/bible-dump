# Isaiah 33

***


###### 1 
Woe to you who plunder, though you _have_ not _been_ plundered; And you who deal treacherously, though they have not dealt treacherously with you! When you cease plundering, You will be plundered; When you make an end of dealing treacherously, They will deal treacherously with you. 

###### 2 
O Lord, be gracious to us; We have waited for You. Be [^a]their arm every morning, Our salvation also in the time of trouble. 

###### 3 
At the noise of the tumult the people shall flee; When You lift Yourself up, the nations shall be scattered; 

###### 4 
And Your plunder shall be gathered _Like_ the gathering of the caterpillar; As the running to and fro of locusts, He shall run upon them. 

###### 5 
The Lord is exalted, for He dwells on high; He has filled Zion with justice and righteousness. 

###### 6 
Wisdom and knowledge will be the stability of your times, _And_ the strength of salvation; The fear of the Lord _is_ His treasure. 

###### 7 
Surely their valiant ones shall cry outside, The ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly. 

###### 8 
The highways lie waste, The traveling man ceases. He has broken the covenant, [^b]He has despised the [^c]cities, He regards no man. 

###### 9 
The earth mourns _and_ languishes, Lebanon is shamed _and_ shriveled; Sharon is like a wilderness, And Bashan and Carmel shake off _their fruits._ ## Impending Judgment on Zion 

###### 10 
"Now I will rise," says the Lord; "Now I will be exalted, Now I will lift Myself up. 

###### 11 
You shall conceive chaff, You shall bring forth stubble; Your breath, _as_ fire, shall devour you. 

###### 12 
And the people shall be _like_ the burnings of lime; _Like_ thorns cut up they shall be burned in the fire. 

###### 13 
Hear, you _who are_ afar off, what I have done; And you _who are_ near, acknowledge My might." 

###### 14 
The sinners in Zion are afraid; Fearfulness has seized the hypocrites: "Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? Who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?" 

###### 15 
He who walks righteously and speaks uprightly, He who despises the gain of oppressions, Who gestures with his hands, refusing bribes, Who stops his ears from hearing of bloodshed, And shuts his eyes from seeing evil: 

###### 16 
He will dwell on [^d]high; His place of defense _will be_ the fortress of rocks; Bread will be given him, His water _will be_ sure. ## The Land of the Majestic King 

###### 17 
Your eyes will see the King in His beauty; They will see the land that is very far off. 

###### 18 
Your heart will meditate on terror: "Where _is_ the scribe? Where _is_ he who weighs? Where _is_ he who counts the towers?" 

###### 19 
You will not see a fierce people, A people of obscure speech, beyond perception, Of a [^e]stammering tongue _that you_ cannot understand. 

###### 20 
Look upon Zion, the city of our appointed feasts; Your eyes will see Jerusalem, a quiet home, A tabernacle _that_ will not be taken down; Not one of its stakes will ever be removed, Nor will any of its cords be broken. 

###### 21 
But there the majestic Lord _will be_ for us A place of broad rivers _and_ streams, In which no [^f]galley with oars will sail, Nor majestic ships pass by 

###### 22 
(For the Lord _is_ our Judge, The Lord _is_ our Lawgiver, The Lord _is_ our King; He will save us); 

###### 23 
Your tackle is loosed, They could not strengthen their mast, They could not spread the sail. Then the prey of great plunder is divided; The lame take the prey. 

###### 24 
And the inhabitant will not say, "I am sick"; The people who dwell in it _will be_ forgiven _their_ iniquity. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

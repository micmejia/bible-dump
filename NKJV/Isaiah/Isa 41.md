# Isaiah 41

***


###### 1 
"Keep silence before Me, O coastlands, And let the people renew _their_ strength! Let them come near, then let them speak; Let us come near together for judgment. 

###### 2 
"Who raised up one from the east? Who in righteousness called him to His feet? Who gave the nations before him, And made _him_ rule over kings? Who gave _them_ as the dust _to_ his sword, As driven stubble to his bow? 

###### 3 
Who pursued them, _and_ passed [^a]safely By the way _that_ he had not gone with his feet? 

###### 4 
Who has performed and done _it,_ Calling the generations from the beginning? 'I, the Lord, am the first; And with the last I _am_ He.' " 

###### 5 
The coastlands saw _it_ and feared, The ends of the earth were afraid; They drew near and came. 

###### 6 
Everyone helped his neighbor, And said to his brother, [^b]"Be of good courage!" 

###### 7 
So the craftsman encouraged the goldsmith;[^c] He who smooths _with_ the hammer _inspired_ him who strikes the anvil, Saying, [^d]"It _is_ ready for the soldering"; Then he fastened it with pegs, _That_ it might not totter. 

###### 8 
"But you, Israel, _are_ My servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, The descendants of Abraham My friend. 

###### 9 
_You_ whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, And called from its farthest regions, And said to you, 'You _are_ My servant, I have chosen you and have not cast you away: 

###### 10 
Fear not, for I _am_ with you; Be not dismayed, for I _am_ your God. I will strengthen you, Yes, I will help you, I will uphold you with My righteous right hand.' 

###### 11 
"Behold, all those who were incensed against you Shall be ashamed and disgraced; They shall be as nothing, And those who strive with you shall perish. 

###### 12 
You shall seek them and not find them-- [^e]Those who contended with you. Those who war against you Shall be as nothing, As a nonexistent thing. 

###### 13 
For I, the Lord your God, will hold your right hand, Saying to you, 'Fear not, I will help you.' 

###### 14 
"Fear not, you worm Jacob, You men of Israel! I will help you," says the Lord And your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel. 

###### 15 
"Behold, I will make you into a new threshing sledge with sharp teeth; You shall thresh the mountains and beat _them_ small, And make the hills like chaff. 

###### 16 
You shall winnow them, the wind shall carry them away, And the whirlwind shall scatter them; You shall rejoice in the Lord, _And_ glory in the Holy One of Israel. 

###### 17 
"The poor and needy seek water, but _there is_ none, Their tongues fail for thirst. I, the Lord, will hear them; _I,_ the God of Israel, will not forsake them. 

###### 18 
I will open rivers in desolate heights, And fountains in the midst of the valleys; I will make the wilderness a pool of water, And the dry land springs of water. 

###### 19 
I will plant in the wilderness the cedar and the acacia tree, The myrtle and the oil tree; I will set in the desert the cypress tree _and_ the pine And the box tree together, 

###### 20 
That they may see and know, And consider and understand together, That the hand of the Lord has done this, And the Holy One of Israel has created it. ## The Futility of Idols 

###### 21 
"Present your case," says the Lord. "Bring forth your strong _reasons,_" says the King of Jacob. 

###### 22 
"Let them bring forth and show us what will happen; Let them show the former things, what they _were,_ That we may [^f]consider them, And know the latter end of them; Or declare to us things to come. 

###### 23 
Show the things that are to come hereafter, That we may know that you _are_ gods; Yes, do good or do evil, That we may be dismayed and see _it_ together. 

###### 24 
Indeed you _are_ nothing, And your work _is_ nothing; _He who_ chooses you _is_ an abomination. 

###### 25 
"I have raised up one from the north, And he shall come; From the [^g]rising of the sun he shall call on My name; And he shall come against princes as _though_ mortar, As the potter treads clay. 

###### 26 
Who has declared from the beginning, that we may know? And former times, that we may say, '_He is_ righteous'? Surely _there is_ no one who shows, Surely _there is_ no one who declares, Surely _there is_ no one who hears your words. 

###### 27 
The first time _I said_ to Zion, 'Look, there they are!' And I will give to Jerusalem one who brings good tidings. 

###### 28 
For I looked, and _there was_ no man; I looked among them, but _there was_ no counselor, Who, when I asked of them, could answer a word. 

###### 29 
Indeed they _are_ all [^h]worthless; Their works _are_ nothing; Their molded images _are_ wind and confusion.

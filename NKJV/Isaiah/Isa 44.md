# Isaiah 44

***


###### 1 
"Yet hear now, O Jacob My servant, And Israel whom I have chosen. 

###### 2 
Thus says the Lord who made you And formed you from the womb, _who_ will help you: 'Fear not, O Jacob My servant; And you, Jeshurun, whom I have chosen. 

###### 3 
For I will pour water on him who is thirsty, And floods on the dry ground; I will pour My Spirit on your descendants, And My blessing on your offspring; 

###### 4 
They will spring up among the grass Like willows by the watercourses.' 

###### 5 
One will say, 'I _am_ the Lord's'; Another will call _himself_ by the name of Jacob; Another will write _with_ his hand, 'The Lord's,' And name _himself_ by the name of Israel. ## There Is No Other God 

###### 6 
"Thus says the Lord, the King of Israel, And his Redeemer, the Lord of hosts: 'I _am_ the First and I _am_ the Last; Besides Me _there is_ no God. 

###### 7 
And who can proclaim as I do? Then let him declare it and set it in order for Me, Since I appointed the ancient people. And the things that are coming and shall come, Let them show these to them. 

###### 8 
Do not fear, nor be afraid; Have I not told you from that time, and declared _it?_ You _are_ My witnesses. Is there a God besides Me? Indeed _there is_ no other Rock; I know not _one._' " ## Idolatry Is Foolishness 

###### 9 
Those who make an image, all of them _are_ useless, And their precious things shall not profit; They _are_ their own witnesses; They neither see nor know, that they may be ashamed. 

###### 10 
Who would form a god or mold an image _That_ profits him nothing? 

###### 11 
Surely all his companions would be ashamed; And the workmen, they _are_ mere men. Let them all be gathered together, Let them stand up; Yet they shall fear, They shall be ashamed together. 

###### 12 
The blacksmith with the tongs works one in the coals, Fashions it with hammers, And works it with the strength of his arms. Even so, he is hungry, and his strength fails; He drinks no water and is faint. 

###### 13 
The craftsman stretches out _his_ rule, He marks one out with chalk; He fashions it with a plane, He marks it out with the compass, And makes it like the figure of a man, According to the beauty of a man, that it may remain in the house. 

###### 14 
He cuts down cedars for himself, And takes the cypress and the oak; He secures _it_ for himself among the trees of the forest. He plants a pine, and the rain nourishes _it._ 

###### 15 
Then it shall be for a man to burn, For he will take some of it and warm himself; Yes, he kindles _it_ and bakes bread; Indeed he makes a god and worships _it;_ He makes it a carved image, and falls down to it. 

###### 16 
He burns half of it in the fire; With this half he eats meat; He roasts a roast, and is satisfied. He even warms _himself_ and says, "Ah! I am warm, I have seen the fire." 

###### 17 
And the rest of it he makes into a god, His carved image. He falls down before it and worships _it,_ Prays to it and says, "Deliver me, for you _are_ my god!" 

###### 18 
They do not know nor understand; For He has shut their eyes, so that they cannot see, _And_ their hearts, so that they cannot understand. 

###### 19 
And no one considers in his heart, Nor _is there_ knowledge nor understanding to say, "I have burned half of it in the fire, Yes, I have also baked bread on its coals; I have roasted meat and eaten _it;_ And shall I make the rest of it an abomination? Shall I fall down before a block of wood?" 

###### 20 
He feeds on ashes; A deceived heart has turned him aside; And he cannot deliver his soul, Nor say, "_Is there_ not a lie in my right hand?" ## Israel Is Not Forgotten 

###### 21 
"Remember these, O Jacob, And Israel, for you _are_ My servant; I have formed you, you _are_ My servant; O Israel, you will not be forgotten by Me! 

###### 22 
I have blotted out, like a thick cloud, your transgressions, And like a cloud, your sins. Return to Me, for I have redeemed you." 

###### 23 
Sing, O heavens, for the Lord has done _it!_ Shout, you lower parts of the earth; Break forth into singing, you mountains, O forest, and every tree in it! For the Lord has redeemed Jacob, And glorified Himself in Israel. ## Judah Will Be Restored 

###### 24 
Thus says the Lord, your Redeemer, And He who formed you from the womb: "I _am_ the Lord, who makes all _things,_ Who stretches out the heavens all alone, Who spreads abroad the earth by Myself; 

###### 25 
Who frustrates the signs of the babblers, And drives diviners mad; Who turns wise men backward, And makes their knowledge foolishness; 

###### 26 
Who confirms the word of His servant, And performs the counsel of His messengers; Who says to Jerusalem, 'You shall be inhabited,' To the cities of Judah, 'You shall be built,' And I will raise up her waste places; 

###### 27 
Who says to the deep, 'Be dry! And I will dry up your rivers'; 

###### 28 
Who says of Cyrus, '_He is_ My shepherd, And he shall perform all My pleasure, Saying to Jerusalem, "You shall be built," And to the temple, "Your foundation shall be laid." '

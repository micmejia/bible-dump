# Isaiah 45

***


###### 1 
"Thus says the Lord to His anointed, To Cyrus, whose right hand I have [^a]held-- To subdue nations before him And loose the armor of kings, To open before him the double doors, So that the gates will not be shut: 

###### 2 
'I will go before you And[^b] make the [^c]crooked places straight; I will break in pieces the gates of bronze And cut the bars of iron. 

###### 3 
I will give you the treasures of darkness And hidden riches of secret places, That you may know that I, the Lord, Who call _you_ by your name, _Am_ the God of Israel. 

###### 4 
For Jacob My servant's sake, And Israel My elect, I have even called you by your name; I have named you, though you have not known Me. 

###### 5 
I _am_ the Lord, and _there is_ no other; _There is_ no God besides Me. I will gird you, though you have not known Me, 

###### 6 
That they may know from the rising of the sun to its setting That _there is_ none besides Me. I _am_ the Lord, and _there is_ no other; 

###### 7 
I form the light and create darkness, I make peace and create calamity; I, the Lord, do all these _things._' 

###### 8 
"Rain down, you heavens, from above, And let the skies pour down righteousness; Let the earth open, let them bring forth salvation, And let righteousness spring up together. I, the Lord, have created it. 

###### 9 
"Woe to him who strives with his Maker! _Let_ the potsherd _strive_ with the potsherds of the earth! Shall the clay say to him who forms it, 'What are you making?' Or shall your handiwork _say,_ 'He has no hands'? 

###### 10 
Woe to him who says to _his_ father, 'What are you begetting?' Or to the woman, 'What have you brought forth?' " 

###### 11 
Thus says the Lord, The Holy One of Israel, and his Maker: "Ask Me of things to come concerning My sons; And concerning the work of My hands, you command Me. 

###### 12 
I have made the earth, And created man on it. I--My hands--stretched out the heavens, And all their host I have commanded. 

###### 13 
I have raised him up in righteousness, And I will [^d]direct all his ways; He shall build My city And let My exiles go free, Not for price nor reward," Says the Lord of hosts. ## The Lord, the Only Savior 

###### 14 
Thus says the Lord: "The labor of Egypt and merchandise of Cush And of the Sabeans, men of stature, Shall come over to you, and they shall be yours; They shall walk behind you, They shall come over in chains; And they shall bow down to you. They will make supplication to you, _saying,_ 'Surely God _is_ in you, And _there is_ no other; _There is_ no other God.' " 

###### 15 
Truly You _are_ God, who hide Yourself, O God of Israel, the Savior! 

###### 16 
They shall be ashamed And also disgraced, all of them; They shall go in confusion together, _Who are_ makers of idols. 

###### 17 
_But_ Israel shall be saved by the Lord With an everlasting salvation; You shall not be ashamed or disgraced Forever and ever. 

###### 18 
For thus says the Lord, Who created the heavens, Who is God, Who formed the earth and made it, Who has established it, Who did not create it [^e]in vain, Who formed it to be inhabited: "I _am_ the Lord, and _there is_ no other. 

###### 19 
I have not spoken in secret, In a dark place of the earth; I did not say to the seed of Jacob, 'Seek Me [^f]in vain'; I, the Lord, speak righteousness, I declare things that are right. 

###### 20 
"Assemble yourselves and come; Draw near together, You _who have_ escaped from the nations. They have no knowledge, Who carry the wood of their carved image, And pray to a god _that_ cannot save. 

###### 21 
Tell and bring forth _your case;_ Yes, let them take counsel together. Who has declared this from ancient time? _Who_ has told it from that time? _Have_ not I, the Lord? And _there is_ no other God besides Me, A just God and a Savior; _There is_ none besides Me. 

###### 22 
"Look to Me, and be saved, All you ends of the earth! For I _am_ God, and _there is_ no other. 

###### 23 
I have sworn by Myself; The word has gone out of My mouth _in_ righteousness, And shall not return, That to Me every knee shall bow, Every tongue shall take an oath. 

###### 24 
He shall say, [^g]'Surely in the Lord I have righteousness and strength. To Him _men_ shall come, And all shall be ashamed Who are incensed against Him. 

###### 25 
In the Lord all the descendants of Israel Shall be justified, and shall glory.'

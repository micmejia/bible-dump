# Isaiah 47

***


###### 1 
"Come down and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon; Sit on the ground without a throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans! For you shall no more be called Tender and [^a]delicate. 

###### 2 
Take the millstones and grind meal. Remove your veil, Take off the skirt, Uncover the thigh, Pass through the rivers. 

###### 3 
Your nakedness shall be uncovered, Yes, your shame will be seen; I will take vengeance, And I will not arbitrate with a man." 

###### 4 
_As for_ our Redeemer, the Lord of hosts _is_ His name, The Holy One of Israel. 

###### 5 
"Sit in silence, and go into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans; For you shall no longer be called The Lady of Kingdoms. 

###### 6 
I was angry with My people; I have profaned My inheritance, And given them into your hand. You showed them no mercy; On the elderly you laid your yoke very heavily. 

###### 7 
And you said, 'I shall be a lady forever,' _So_ that you did not take these _things_ to heart, Nor remember the latter end of them. 

###### 8 
"Therefore hear this now, _you who are_ given to pleasures, Who dwell securely, Who say in your heart, 'I _am,_ and _there is_ no one else besides me; I shall not sit _as_ a widow, Nor shall I know the loss of children'; 

###### 9 
But these two _things_ shall come to you In a moment, in one day: The loss of children, and widowhood. They shall come upon you in their fullness Because of the multitude of your sorceries, For the great abundance of your enchantments. 

###### 10 
"For you have trusted in your wickedness; You have said, 'No one sees me'; Your wisdom and your knowledge have [^b]warped you; And you have said in your heart, 'I _am,_ and _there is_ no one else besides me.' 

###### 11 
Therefore evil shall come upon you; You shall not know from where it arises. And trouble shall fall upon you; You will not be able [^c]to put it off. And desolation shall come upon you suddenly, _Which_ you shall not know. 

###### 12 
"Stand now with your enchantments And the multitude of your sorceries, In which you have labored from your youth-- Perhaps you will be able to profit, Perhaps you will prevail. 

###### 13 
You are wearied in the multitude of your counsels; Let now the[^d] astrologers, the stargazers, _And_ [^e]the monthly prognosticators Stand up and save you From what shall come upon you. 

###### 14 
Behold, they shall be as stubble, The fire shall burn them; They shall not deliver themselves From the power of the flame; _It shall_ not _be_ a coal to be warmed by, _Nor_ a fire to sit before! 

###### 15 
Thus shall they be to you With whom you have labored, Your merchants from your youth; They shall wander each one to his [^f]quarter. No one shall save you. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

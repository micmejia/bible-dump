# Isaiah 5

***


###### 1 
Now let me sing to my Well-beloved A song of my Beloved regarding His vineyard: My Well-beloved has a vineyard [^a]On a very fruitful hill. 

###### 2 
He dug it up and cleared out its stones, And planted it with the choicest vine. He built a tower in its midst, And also [^b]made a winepress in it; So He expected _it_ to bring forth _good_ grapes, But it brought forth wild grapes. 

###### 3 
"And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, Judge, please, between Me and My vineyard. 

###### 4 
What more could have been done to My vineyard That I have not done in it? Why then, when I expected _it_ to bring forth _good_ grapes, Did it bring forth wild grapes? 

###### 5 
And now, please let Me tell you what I will do to My vineyard: I will take away its hedge, and it shall be burned; _And_ break down its wall, and it shall be trampled down. 

###### 6 
I will lay it waste; It shall not be pruned or [^c]dug, But there shall come up briers and thorns. I will also command the clouds That they rain no rain on it." 

###### 7 
For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts _is_ the house of Israel, And the men of Judah are His pleasant plant. He looked for justice, but behold, oppression; For righteousness, but behold, [^d]a cry _for help._ ## Impending Judgment on Excesses 

###### 8 
Woe to those who [^e]join house to house; They add field to field, Till _there is_ no place Where they may dwell alone in the midst of the land! 

###### 9 
In my hearing the Lord of hosts _said,_ "Truly, many houses shall be desolate, Great and beautiful ones, without inhabitant. 

###### 10 
For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath,[^f] And a homer of seed shall yield one [^g]ephah." 

###### 11 
Woe to those who rise early in the morning, _That_ they may [^h]follow intoxicating drink; Who continue until night, _till_ wine inflames them! 

###### 12 
The harp and the strings, The tambourine and flute, And wine are in their feasts; But they do not regard the work of the Lord, Nor consider the operation of His hands. 

###### 13 
Therefore my people have gone into captivity, Because _they have_ no knowledge; Their honorable men _are_ famished, And their multitude dried up with thirst. 

###### 14 
Therefore Sheol has enlarged itself And opened its mouth beyond measure; Their glory and their multitude and their pomp, And he who is jubilant, shall descend into it. 

###### 15 
People shall be brought down, Each man shall be humbled, And the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled. 

###### 16 
But the Lord of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, And God who is holy shall be hallowed in righteousness. 

###### 17 
Then the lambs shall feed in their pasture, And in the waste places of the [^i]fat ones strangers shall eat. 

###### 18 
Woe to those who [^j]draw iniquity with cords of [^k]vanity, And sin as if with a cart rope; 

###### 19 
That say, "Let Him make speed _and_ hasten His work, That we may see _it;_ And let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come, That we may know _it._" 

###### 20 
Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil; Who put darkness for light, and light for darkness; Who put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter! 

###### 21 
Woe to _those who are_ wise in their own eyes, And prudent in their own sight! 

###### 22 
Woe to men mighty at drinking wine, Woe to men valiant for mixing intoxicating drink, 

###### 23 
Who justify the wicked for a bribe, And take away justice from the righteous man! 

###### 24 
Therefore, as the [^l]fire devours the stubble, And the flame consumes the chaff, _So_ their root will be as rottenness, And their blossom will ascend like dust; Because they have rejected the law of the Lord of hosts, And despised the word of the Holy One of Israel. 

###### 25 
Therefore the anger of the Lord is aroused against His people; He has stretched out His hand against them And stricken them, And the hills trembled. Their carcasses _were_ as refuse in the midst of the streets. For all this His anger is not turned away, But His hand _is_ stretched out still. 

###### 26 
He will lift up a banner to the nations from afar, And will whistle to them from the end of the earth; Surely they shall come with speed, swiftly. 

###### 27 
No one will be weary or stumble among them, No one will slumber or sleep; Nor will the belt on their loins be loosed, Nor the strap of their sandals be broken; 

###### 28 
Whose arrows _are_ sharp, And all their bows bent; Their horses' hooves will [^m]seem like flint, And their wheels like a whirlwind. 

###### 29 
Their roaring _will be_ like a lion, They will roar like young lions; Yes, they will roar And lay hold of the prey; They will carry _it_ away safely, And no one will deliver. 

###### 30 
In that day they will roar against them Like the roaring of the sea. And if _one_ looks to the land, Behold, darkness _and_ [^n]sorrow; And the light is darkened by the clouds. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

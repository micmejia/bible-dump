# Isaiah 50

***


###### 1 
Thus says the Lord: "Where _is_ the certificate of your mother's divorce, Whom I have put away? Or which of My creditors _is it_ to whom I have sold you? For your iniquities you have sold yourselves, And for your transgressions your mother has been put away. 

###### 2 
Why, when I came, _was there_ no man? _Why,_ when I called, _was there_ none to answer? Is My hand shortened at all that it cannot redeem? Or have I no power to deliver? Indeed with My rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness; Their fish stink because _there is_ no water, And die of thirst. 

###### 3 
I clothe the heavens with blackness, And I make sackcloth their covering." 

###### 4 
"The Lord God has given Me The tongue of the learned, That I should know how to speak A word in season to _him who is_ weary. He awakens Me morning by morning, He awakens My ear To hear as the learned. 

###### 5 
The Lord God has opened My ear; And I was not rebellious, Nor did I turn away. 

###### 6 
I gave My back to those who struck _Me,_ And My cheeks to those who plucked out the beard; I did not hide My face from shame and spitting. 

###### 7 
"For the Lord God will help Me; Therefore I will not be disgraced; Therefore I have set My face like a flint, And I know that I will not be ashamed. 

###### 8 
_He is_ near who justifies Me; Who will contend with Me? Let us stand together. Who _is_ My adversary? Let him come near Me. 

###### 9 
Surely the Lord God will help Me; Who _is_ he _who_ will condemn Me? Indeed they will all grow old like a garment; The moth will eat them up. 

###### 10 
"Who among you fears the Lord? Who obeys the voice of His Servant? Who walks in darkness And has no light? Let him trust in the name of the Lord And rely upon his God. 

###### 11 
Look, all you who kindle a fire, Who encircle _yourselves_ with sparks: Walk in the light of your fire and in the sparks you have kindled-- This you shall have from My hand: You shall lie down in torment.

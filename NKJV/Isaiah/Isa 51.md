# Isaiah 51

***


###### 1 
"Listen to Me, you who [^a]follow after righteousness, You who seek the Lord: Look to the rock _from which_ you were hewn, And to the hole of the pit _from which_ you were dug. 

###### 2 
Look to Abraham your father, And to Sarah _who_ bore you; For I called him alone, And blessed him and increased him." 

###### 3 
For the Lord will comfort Zion, He will comfort all her waste places; He will make her wilderness like Eden, And her desert like the garden of the Lord; Joy and gladness will be found in it, Thanksgiving and the voice of melody. 

###### 4 
"Listen to Me, My people; And give ear to Me, O My nation: For law will proceed from Me, And I will make My justice rest As a light of the peoples. 

###### 5 
My righteousness _is_ near, My salvation has gone forth, And My arms will judge the peoples; The coastlands will wait upon Me, And on My arm they will trust. 

###### 6 
Lift up your eyes to the heavens, And look on the earth beneath. For the heavens will vanish away like smoke, The earth will grow old like a garment, And those who dwell in it will die in like manner; But My salvation will be forever, And My righteousness will not be [^b]abolished. 

###### 7 
"Listen to Me, you who know righteousness, You people in whose heart _is_ My law: Do not fear the reproach of men, Nor be afraid of their insults. 

###### 8 
For the moth will eat them up like a garment, And the worm will eat them like wool; But My righteousness will be forever, And My salvation from generation to generation." 

###### 9 
Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the Lord! Awake as in the ancient days, In the generations of old. _Are_ You not _the arm_ that cut Rahab apart, _And_ wounded the serpent? 

###### 10 
_Are_ You not _the One_ who dried up the sea, The waters of the great deep; That made the depths of the sea a road For the redeemed to cross over? 

###### 11 
So the ransomed of the Lord shall return, And come to Zion with singing, With everlasting joy on their heads. They shall obtain joy and gladness; Sorrow and sighing shall flee away. 

###### 12 
"I, _even_ I, _am_ He who comforts you. Who _are_ you that you should be afraid Of a man _who_ will die, And of the son of a man _who_ will be made like grass? 

###### 13 
And you forget the Lord your Maker, Who stretched out the heavens And laid the foundations of the earth; You have feared continually every day Because of the fury of the oppressor, When _he has_ prepared to destroy. And where _is_ the fury of the oppressor? 

###### 14 
The captive exile hastens, that he may be loosed, That he should not die in the pit, And that his bread should not fail. 

###### 15 
But I _am_ the Lord your God, Who divided the sea whose waves roared-- The Lord of hosts _is_ His name. 

###### 16 
And I have put My words in your mouth; I have covered you with the shadow of My hand, That I may [^c]plant the heavens, Lay the foundations of the earth, And say to Zion, 'You _are_ My people.' " ## God's Fury Removed 

###### 17 
Awake, awake! Stand up, O Jerusalem, You who have drunk at the hand of the Lord The cup of His fury; You have drunk the dregs of the cup of trembling, _And_ drained _it_ out. 

###### 18 
_There is_ no one to guide her Among all the sons she has brought forth; Nor _is there any_ who takes her by the hand Among all the sons she has brought up. 

###### 19 
These two _things_ have come to you; Who will be sorry for you?-- Desolation and destruction, famine and sword-- By whom will I comfort you? 

###### 20 
Your sons have fainted, They lie at the head of all the streets, Like an antelope in a net; They are full of the fury of the Lord, The rebuke of your God. 

###### 21 
Therefore please hear this, you afflicted, And drunk but not with wine. 

###### 22 
Thus says your Lord, The Lord and your God, _Who_ pleads the cause of His people: "See, I have taken out of your hand The cup of trembling, The dregs of the cup of My fury; You shall no longer drink it. 

###### 23 
But I will put it into the hand of those who afflict you, Who have said to [^d]you, 'Lie down, that we may walk over you.' And you have laid your body like the ground, And as the street, for those who walk over."

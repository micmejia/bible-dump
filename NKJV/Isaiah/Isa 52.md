# Isaiah 52

***


###### 1 
Awake, awake! Put on your strength, O Zion; Put on your beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city! For the uncircumcised and the unclean Shall no longer come to you. 

###### 2 
Shake yourself from the dust, arise; Sit down, O Jerusalem! Loose yourself from the bonds of your neck, O captive daughter of Zion! 

###### 3 
For thus says the Lord: "You have sold yourselves for nothing, And you shall be redeemed without money." 

###### 4 
For thus says the Lord God: "My people went down at first Into Egypt to [^a]dwell there; Then the Assyrian oppressed them without cause. 

###### 5 
Now therefore, what have I here," says the Lord, "That My people are taken away for nothing? Those who rule over them [^b]Make them wail," says the Lord, "And My name _is_ blasphemed continually every day. 

###### 6 
Therefore My people shall know My name; Therefore _they shall know_ in that day That I _am_ He who speaks: 'Behold, _it is_ I.' " 

###### 7 
How beautiful upon the mountains Are the feet of him who brings good news, Who proclaims peace, Who brings glad tidings of good _things,_ Who proclaims salvation, Who says to Zion, "Your God reigns!" 

###### 8 
Your watchmen shall lift up _their_ voices, With their voices they shall sing together; For they shall see eye to eye When the Lord brings back Zion. 

###### 9 
Break forth into joy, sing together, You waste places of Jerusalem! For the Lord has comforted His people, He has redeemed Jerusalem. 

###### 10 
The Lord has [^c]made bare His holy arm In the eyes of all the nations; And all the ends of the earth shall see The salvation of our God. 

###### 11 
Depart! Depart! Go out from there, Touch no unclean _thing;_ Go out from the midst of her, Be clean, You who bear the vessels of the Lord. 

###### 12 
For you shall not go out with haste, Nor go by flight; For the Lord will go before you, And the God of Israel _will be_ your rear guard. ## The Sin-Bearing Servant 

###### 13 
Behold, My Servant shall [^d]deal prudently; He shall be exalted and [^e]extolled and be very high. 

###### 14 
Just as many were astonished at you, So His visage[^f] was marred more than any man, And His form more than the sons of men; 

###### 15 
So shall He [^g]sprinkle many nations. Kings shall shut their mouths at Him; For what had not been told them they shall see, And what they had not heard they shall consider. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

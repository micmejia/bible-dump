# Isaiah 53

***


###### 1 
Who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed? 

###### 2 
For He shall grow up before Him as a tender plant, And as a root out of dry ground. He has no [^a]form or [^b]comeliness; And when we see Him, _There is_ no [^c]beauty that we should desire Him. 

###### 3 
He is despised and [^d]rejected by men, A Man of [^e]sorrows and acquainted with [^f]grief. And we hid, as it were, _our_ faces from Him; He was despised, and we did not esteem Him. 

###### 4 
Surely He has borne our [^g]griefs And carried our [^h]sorrows; Yet we [^i]esteemed Him stricken, [^j]Smitten by God, and afflicted. 

###### 5 
But He _was_ wounded[^k] for our transgressions, _He was_ [^l]bruised for our iniquities; The chastisement for our peace _was_ upon Him, And by His stripes[^m] we are healed. 

###### 6 
All we like sheep have gone astray; We have turned, every one, to his own way; And the Lord [^n]has laid on Him the iniquity of us all. 

###### 7 
He was oppressed and He was afflicted, Yet He opened not His mouth; He was led as a lamb to the slaughter, And as a sheep before its shearers is silent, So He opened not His mouth. 

###### 8 
He was taken from [^o]prison and from judgment, And who will declare His generation? For He was cut off from the land of the living; For the transgressions of My people He was stricken. 

###### 9 
And [^p]they made His grave with the wicked-- But with the rich at His death, Because He had done no violence, Nor _was any_ deceit in His mouth. 

###### 10 
Yet it pleased the Lord to [^q]bruise Him; He has put _Him_ to grief. When You make His soul an offering for sin, He shall see _His_ seed, He shall prolong _His_ days, And the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in His hand. 

###### 11 
[^r]He shall see the labor of His soul, _and_ be satisfied. By His knowledge My righteous Servant shall justify many, For He shall bear their iniquities. 

###### 12 
Therefore I will divide Him a portion with the great, And He shall divide the [^s]spoil with the strong, Because He poured out His soul unto death, And He was numbered with the transgressors, And He bore the sin of many, And made intercession for the transgressors.

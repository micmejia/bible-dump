# Isaiah 54

***


###### 1 
"Sing, O barren, You _who_ have not borne! Break forth into singing, and cry aloud, You _who_ have not labored with child! For more _are_ the children of the desolate Than the children of the married woman," says the Lord. 

###### 2 
"Enlarge the place of your tent, And let them stretch out the curtains of your dwellings; Do not spare; Lengthen your cords, And strengthen your stakes. 

###### 3 
For you shall expand to the right and to the left, And your descendants will inherit the nations, And make the desolate cities inhabited. 

###### 4 
"Do not fear, for you will not be ashamed; Neither be disgraced, for you will not be put to shame; For you will forget the shame of your youth, And will not remember the reproach of your widowhood anymore. 

###### 5 
For your Maker _is_ your husband, The Lord of hosts _is_ His name; And your Redeemer _is_ the Holy One of Israel; He is called the God of the whole earth. 

###### 6 
For the Lord has called you Like a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit, Like a youthful wife when you were refused," Says your God. 

###### 7 
"For a mere moment I have forsaken you, But with great mercies I will gather you. 

###### 8 
With a little wrath I hid My face from you for a moment; But with everlasting kindness I will have mercy on you," Says the Lord, your Redeemer. 

###### 9 
"For this _is_ like the waters of Noah to Me; For as I have sworn That the waters of Noah would no longer cover the earth, So have I sworn That I would not be angry with you, nor rebuke you. 

###### 10 
For the mountains shall depart And the hills be removed, But My kindness shall not depart from you, Nor shall My covenant of peace be removed," Says the Lord, who has mercy on you. 

###### 11 
"O you afflicted one, Tossed with tempest, _and_ not comforted, Behold, I will lay your stones with colorful gems, And lay your foundations with sapphires. 

###### 12 
I will make your pinnacles of rubies, Your gates of crystal, And all your walls of precious stones. 

###### 13 
All your children _shall be_ taught by the Lord, And great _shall be_ the peace of your children. 

###### 14 
In righteousness you shall be established; You shall be far from oppression, for you shall not fear; And from terror, for it shall not come near you. 

###### 15 
Indeed they shall surely assemble, _but_ not because of Me. Whoever assembles against you shall fall for your sake. 

###### 16 
"Behold, I have created the blacksmith Who blows the coals in the fire, Who brings forth an instrument for his work; And I have created the spoiler to destroy. 

###### 17 
No weapon formed against you shall prosper, And every tongue _which_ rises against you in judgment You shall condemn. This _is_ the heritage of the servants of the Lord, And their righteousness _is_ from Me," Says the Lord.

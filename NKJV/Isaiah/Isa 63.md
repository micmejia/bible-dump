# Isaiah 63

***


###### 1 
Who _is_ this who comes from Edom, With dyed garments from Bozrah, This _One who is_ [^a]glorious in His apparel, Traveling in the greatness of His strength?-- "I who speak in righteousness, mighty to save." 

###### 2 
Why _is_ Your apparel red, And Your garments like one who treads in the winepress? 

###### 3 
"I have trodden the winepress alone, And from the peoples no one _was_ with Me. For I have trodden them in My anger, And trampled them in My fury; Their blood is sprinkled upon My garments, And I have stained all My robes. 

###### 4 
For the day of vengeance _is_ in My heart, And the year of My redeemed has come. 

###### 5 
I looked, but _there was_ no one to help, And I wondered That _there was_ no one to uphold; Therefore My own arm brought salvation for Me; And My own fury, it sustained Me. 

###### 6 
I have trodden down the peoples in My anger, Made them drunk in My fury, And brought down their strength to the earth." ## God's Mercy Remembered 

###### 7 
I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the Lord _And_ the praises of the Lord, According to all that the Lord has bestowed on us, And the great goodness toward the house of Israel, Which He has bestowed on them according to His mercies, According to the multitude of His lovingkindnesses. 

###### 8 
For He said, "Surely they _are_ My people, Children _who_ will not lie." So He became their Savior. 

###### 9 
In all their affliction He was [^b]afflicted, And the Angel of His Presence saved them; In His love and in His pity He redeemed them; And He bore them and carried them All the days of old. 

###### 10 
But they rebelled and grieved His Holy Spirit; So He turned Himself against them as an enemy, _And_ He fought against them. 

###### 11 
Then he remembered the days of old, Moses _and_ his people, _saying:_ "Where _is_ He who brought them up out of the sea With the [^c]shepherd of His flock? Where _is_ He who put His Holy Spirit within them, 

###### 12 
Who led _them_ by the right hand of Moses, With His glorious arm, Dividing the water before them To make for Himself an everlasting name, 

###### 13 
Who led them through the deep, As a horse in the wilderness, _That_ they might not stumble?" 

###### 14 
As a beast goes down into the valley, _And_ the Spirit of the Lord causes him to rest, So You lead Your people, To make Yourself a glorious name. ## A Prayer of Penitence 

###### 15 
Look down from heaven, And see from Your habitation, holy and glorious. Where _are_ Your zeal and Your strength, The yearning of Your heart and Your mercies toward me? Are they restrained? 

###### 16 
Doubtless You _are_ our Father, Though Abraham was ignorant of us, And Israel does not acknowledge us. You, O Lord, _are_ our Father; Our Redeemer from Everlasting _is_ Your name. 

###### 17 
O Lord, why have You made us stray from Your ways, _And_ hardened our heart from Your fear? Return for Your servants' sake, The tribes of Your inheritance. 

###### 18 
Your holy people have possessed _it_ but a little while; Our adversaries have trodden down Your sanctuary. 

###### 19 
We have become _like_ those of old, over whom You never ruled, Those who were never called by Your name. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

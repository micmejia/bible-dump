# Isaiah 64

***


###### 1 
Oh, that You would [^a]rend the heavens! That You would come down! That the mountains might shake at Your presence-- 

###### 2 
As fire burns brushwood, As fire causes water to boil-- To make Your name known to Your adversaries, _That_ the nations may tremble at Your presence! 

###### 3 
When You did awesome things _for which_ we did not look, You came down, The mountains shook at Your presence. 

###### 4 
For since the beginning of the world _Men_ have not heard nor perceived by the ear, Nor has the eye seen any God besides You, Who acts for the one who waits for Him. 

###### 5 
You meet him who rejoices and does righteousness, _Who_ remembers You in Your ways. You are indeed angry, for we have sinned-- In these ways we continue; And we need to be saved. 

###### 6 
But we are all like an unclean _thing,_ And all our righteousnesses _are_ like [^b]filthy rags; We all fade as a leaf, And our iniquities, like the wind, Have taken us away. 

###### 7 
And _there is_ no one who calls on Your name, Who stirs himself up to take hold of You; For You have hidden Your face from us, And have [^c]consumed us because of our iniquities. 

###### 8 
But now, O Lord, You _are_ our Father; We _are_ the clay, and You our potter; And all we _are_ the work of Your hand. 

###### 9 
Do not be furious, O Lord, Nor remember iniquity forever; Indeed, please look--we all _are_ Your people! 

###### 10 
Your holy cities are a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation. 

###### 11 
Our holy and beautiful [^d]temple, Where our fathers praised You, Is burned up with fire; And all our pleasant things [^e]are laid waste. 

###### 12 
Will You restrain Yourself because of these _things,_ O Lord? Will You [^f]hold Your peace, and afflict us very severely?

# Isaiah 7

***


###### 1 
Now it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, _that_ Rezin king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to _make_ war against it, but could not [^a]prevail against it. 

###### 2 
And it was told to the house of David, saying, "Syria's forces are [^b]deployed in Ephraim." So his heart and the heart of his people were moved as the trees of the woods are moved with the wind. 

###### 3 
Then the Lord said to Isaiah, "Go out now to meet Ahaz, you and [^c]Shear-Jashub your son, at the end of the aqueduct from the upper pool, on the highway to the Fuller's Field, 

###### 4 
and say to him: [^d]'Take heed, and [^e]be quiet; do not fear or be fainthearted for these two stubs of smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria, and the son of Remaliah. 

###### 5 
Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah have plotted evil against you, saying, 

###### 6 
"Let us go up against Judah and [^f]trouble it, and let us make a gap in its wall for ourselves, and set a king over them, the son of Tabel"-- 

###### 7 
thus says the Lord God: "It shall not stand, Nor shall it come to pass. 

###### 8 
For the head of Syria _is_ Damascus, And the head of Damascus _is_ Rezin. Within sixty-five years Ephraim will be [^g]broken, _So that it will_ not _be_ a people. 

###### 9 
The head of Ephraim _is_ Samaria, And the head of Samaria _is_ Remaliah's son. If you will not believe, Surely you shall not be established." ' " ## The Immanuel Prophecy 

###### 10 
Moreover the Lord spoke again to Ahaz, saying, 

###### 11 
"Ask a sign for yourself from the Lord your God; [^h]ask it either in the depth or in the height above." 

###### 12 
But Ahaz said, "I will not ask, nor will I test the Lord!" 

###### 13 
Then he said, "Hear now, O house of David! _Is it_ a small thing for you to weary men, but will you weary my God also? 

###### 14 
Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and shall call His name Immanuel.[^i] 

###### 15 
Curds and honey He shall eat, that He may know to refuse the evil and choose the good. 

###### 16 
For before the Child shall know to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land that you dread will be forsaken by both her kings. 

###### 17 
The Lord will bring the king of Assyria upon you and your people and your father's house--days that have not come since the day that Ephraim departed from Judah." 

###### 18 
And it shall come to pass in that day _That_ the Lord will whistle for the fly That _is_ in the farthest part of the rivers of Egypt, And for the bee that _is_ in the land of Assyria. 

###### 19 
They will come, and all of them will rest In the desolate valleys and in the clefts of the rocks, And on all thorns and in all pastures. 

###### 20 
In the same day the Lord will shave with a hired razor, With those from beyond [^j]the River, with the king of Assyria, The head and the hair of the legs, And will also remove the beard. 

###### 21 
It shall be in that day _That_ a man will keep alive a young cow and two sheep; 

###### 22 
So it shall be, from the abundance of milk they give, That he will eat curds; For curds and honey everyone will eat who is left in the land. 

###### 23 
It shall happen in that day, _That_ wherever there could be a thousand vines _Worth_ a thousand _shekels_ of silver, It will be for briers and thorns. 

###### 24 
With arrows and bows _men_ will come there, Because all the land will become briers and thorns. 

###### 25 
And to any hill which could be dug with the hoe, You will not go there for fear of briers and thorns; But it will become a range for oxen And a place for sheep to roam. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

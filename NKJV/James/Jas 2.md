# James 2

***


###### 1 
My brethren, do not hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, _the Lord_ of glory, with partiality. 

###### 2 
For if there should come into your assembly a man with gold rings, in [^a]fine apparel, and there should also come in a poor man in [^b]filthy clothes, 

###### 3 
and you [^c]pay attention to the one wearing the fine clothes and say to him, "You sit here in a good place," and say to the poor man, "You stand there," or, "Sit here at my footstool," 

###### 4 
have you not [^d]shown partiality among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts? 

###### 5 
Listen, my beloved brethren: Has God not chosen the poor of this world _to be_ rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which He promised to those who love Him? 

###### 6 
But you have dishonored the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you and drag you into the courts? 

###### 7 
Do they not blaspheme that noble name by which you are called? 

###### 8 
If you really fulfill _the_ royal law according to the Scripture, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself," you do well; 

###### 9 
but if you [^e]show partiality, you commit sin, and are convicted by the law as transgressors. 

###### 10 
For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one _point,_ he is guilty of all. 

###### 11 
For He who said, "Do not commit adultery," also said, "Do not murder." Now if you do not commit adultery, but you do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law. 

###### 12 
So speak and so do as those who will be judged by the law of liberty. 

###### 13 
For judgment is without mercy to the one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment. ## Faith Without Works Is Dead 

###### 14 
What _does it_ profit, my brethren, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can faith save him? 

###### 15 
If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food, 

###### 16 
and one of you says to them, "Depart in peace, be warmed and filled," but you do not give them the things which are needed for the body, what _does it_ profit? 

###### 17 
Thus also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead. 

###### 18 
But someone will say, "You have faith, and I have works." Show me your faith without [^f]your works, and I will show you my faith by [^g]my works. 

###### 19 
You believe that there is one God. You do well. Even the demons believe--and tremble! 

###### 20 
But do you want to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is [^h]dead? 

###### 21 
Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered Isaac his son on the altar? 

###### 22 
Do you see that faith was working together with his works, and by works faith was made [^i]perfect? 

###### 23 
And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, "Abraham believed God, and it was [^j]accounted to him for righteousness." And he was called the friend of God. 

###### 24 
You see then that a man is justified by works, and not by faith only. 

###### 25 
Likewise, was not Rahab the harlot also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent _them_ out another way? 

###### 26 
For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

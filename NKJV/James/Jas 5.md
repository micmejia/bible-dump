# James 5

***


###### 1 
Come now, _you_ rich, weep and howl for your miseries that are coming upon _you!_ 

###### 2 
Your riches [^a]are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten. 

###### 3 
Your gold and silver are corroded, and their corrosion will be a witness against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You have heaped up treasure in the last days. 

###### 4 
Indeed the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you kept back by fraud, cry out; and the cries of the reapers have reached the ears of the Lord of [^b]Sabaoth. 

###### 5 
You have lived on the earth in pleasure and [^c]luxury; you have [^d]fattened your hearts [^e]as in a day of slaughter. 

###### 6 
You have condemned, you have murdered the just; he does not resist you. ## Be Patient and Persevering 

###### 7 
Therefore be patient, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. See _how_ the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, waiting patiently for it until it receives the early and latter rain. 

###### 8 
You also be patient. Establish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord [^f]is at hand. 

###### 9 
Do not [^g]grumble against one another, brethren, lest you be [^h]condemned. Behold, the Judge is standing at the door! 

###### 10 
My brethren, take the prophets, who spoke in the name of the Lord, as an example of suffering and patience. 

###### 11 
Indeed we count them blessed who endure. You have heard of the perseverance of Job and seen the end _intended by_ the Lord--that the Lord is very compassionate and merciful. 

###### 12 
But above all, my brethren, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or with any other oath. But let your "Yes" be "Yes," and _your_ "No," "No," lest you fall into [^i]judgment. ## Meeting Specific Needs 

###### 13 
Is anyone among you suffering? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing psalms. 

###### 14 
Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. 

###### 15 
And the prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven. 

###### 16 
[^j]Confess _your_ trespasses to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The effective, [^k]fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much. 

###### 17 
Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed earnestly that it would not rain; and it did not rain on the land for three years and six months. 

###### 18 
And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth produced its fruit. ## Bring Back the Erring One 

###### 19 
Brethren, if anyone among you wanders from the truth, and someone turns him back, 

###### 20 
let him know that he who turns a sinner from the error of his way will save [^l]a soul from death and cover a multitude of sins. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Jeremiah 10

***


###### 1 
Hear the word which the Lord speaks to you, O house of Israel. 

###### 2 
Thus says the Lord: "Do not learn the way of the Gentiles; Do not be dismayed at the signs of heaven, For the Gentiles are dismayed at them. 

###### 3 
For the customs of the peoples _are_ futile; For _one_ cuts a tree from the forest, The work of the hands of the workman, with the ax. 

###### 4 
They decorate it with silver and gold; They fasten it with nails and hammers So that it will not topple. 

###### 5 
They _are_ upright, like a palm tree, And they cannot speak; They must be carried, Because they cannot go _by themselves._ Do not be afraid of them, For they cannot do evil, Nor can they do any good." 

###### 6 
Inasmuch as _there is_ none like You, O Lord (You _are_ great, and Your name _is_ great in might), 

###### 7 
Who would not fear You, O King of the nations? For this is Your rightful due. For among all the wise _men_ of the nations, And in all their kingdoms, _There is_ none like You. 

###### 8 
But they are altogether dull-hearted and foolish; A wooden idol _is_ a worthless doctrine. 

###### 9 
Silver is beaten into plates; It is brought from Tarshish, And gold from Uphaz, The work of the craftsman And of the hands of the metalsmith; Blue and purple _are_ their clothing; They _are_ all the work of skillful _men._ 

###### 10 
But the Lord _is_ the true God; He _is_ the living God and the everlasting King. At His wrath the earth will tremble, And the nations will not be able to endure His indignation. 

###### 11 
Thus you shall say to them: "The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth shall perish from the earth and from under these heavens." 

###### 12 
He has made the earth by His power, He has established the world by His wisdom, And has stretched out the heavens at His discretion. 

###### 13 
When He utters His voice, _There is_ a multitude of waters in the heavens: "And He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth. He makes lightning for the rain, He brings the wind out of His treasuries." 

###### 14 
Everyone is dull-hearted, without knowledge; Every metalsmith is put to shame by an image; For his molded image _is_ falsehood, And _there is_ no breath in them. 

###### 15 
They _are_ futile, a work of errors; In the time of their punishment they shall perish. 

###### 16 
The Portion of Jacob _is_ not like them, For He _is_ the Maker of all _things,_ And Israel _is_ the tribe of His inheritance; The Lord of hosts _is_ His name.

## The Coming Captivity of Judah 

###### 17 
Gather up your wares from the land, O inhabitant of the fortress! 

###### 18 
For thus says the Lord: "Behold, I will throw out at this time The inhabitants of the land, And will distress them, That they may find _it so._" 

###### 19 
Woe is me for my hurt! My wound is severe. But I say, "Truly this _is_ an infirmity, And I must bear it." 

###### 20 
My tent is plundered, And all my cords are broken; My children have gone from me, And they _are_ no more. _There is_ no one to pitch my tent anymore, Or set up my curtains. 

###### 21 
For the shepherds have become dull-hearted, And have not sought the Lord; Therefore they shall not prosper, And all their flocks shall be scattered. 

###### 22 
Behold, the noise of the report has come, And a great commotion out of the north country, To make the cities of Judah desolate, a den of jackals. 

###### 23 
O Lord, I know the way of man _is_ not in himself; _It is_ not in man who walks to direct his own steps. 

###### 24 
O Lord, correct me, but with justice; Not in Your anger, lest You bring me to nothing. 

###### 25 
Pour out Your fury on the Gentiles, who do not know You, And on the families who do not call on Your name; For they have eaten up Jacob, Devoured him and consumed him, And made his dwelling place desolate.

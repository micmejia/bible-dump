# Jeremiah 14

***


###### 1 
The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah concerning the droughts. 

###### 2 
"Judah mourns, And her gates languish; They mourn for the land, And the cry of Jerusalem has gone up. 

###### 3 
Their nobles have sent their lads for water; They went to the cisterns _and_ found no water. They returned with their vessels empty; They were ashamed and confounded And covered their heads. 

###### 4 
Because the ground is parched, For there was no rain in the land, The plowmen were ashamed; They covered their heads. 

###### 5 
Yes, the deer also gave birth in the field, But [^a]left because there was no grass. 

###### 6 
And the wild donkeys stood in the desolate heights; They sniffed at the wind like jackals; Their eyes failed because _there was_ no grass." 

###### 7 
O Lord, though our iniquities testify against us, Do it for Your name's sake; For our backslidings are many, We have sinned against You. 

###### 8 
O the Hope of Israel, his Savior in time of trouble, Why should You be like a stranger in the land, And like a traveler _who_ turns aside to tarry for a night? 

###### 9 
Why should You be like a man astonished, Like a mighty one _who_ cannot save? Yet You, O Lord, _are_ in our midst, And we are called by Your name; Do not leave us! 

###### 10 
Thus says the Lord to this people: "Thus they have loved to wander; They have not restrained their feet. Therefore the Lord does not accept them; He will remember their iniquity now, And punish their sins." 

###### 11 
Then the Lord said to me, "Do not pray for this people, for _their_ good. 

###### 12 
When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and grain offering, I will not accept them. But I will consume them by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence." 

###### 13 
Then I said, "Ah, Lord God! Behold, the prophets say to them, 'You shall not see the sword, nor shall you have famine, but I will give you [^b]assured peace in this place.' " 

###### 14 
And the Lord said to me, "The prophets prophesy lies in My name. I have not sent them, commanded them, nor spoken to them; they prophesy to you a false vision, [^c]divination, a worthless thing, and the deceit of their heart. 

###### 15 
Therefore thus says the Lord concerning the prophets who prophesy in My name, whom I did not send, and who say, 'Sword and famine shall not be in this land'--'By sword and famine those prophets shall be consumed! 

###### 16 
And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; they will have no one to bury them--them nor their wives, their sons nor their daughters--for I will pour their wickedness on them.' 

###### 17 
"Therefore you shall say this word to them: 'Let my eyes flow with tears night and day, And let them not cease; For the virgin daughter of my people Has been broken with a mighty stroke, with a very severe blow. 

###### 18 
If I go out to the field, Then behold, those slain with the sword! And if I enter the city, Then behold, those sick from famine! Yes, both prophet and priest go about in a land they do not know.' " ## The People Plead for Mercy 

###### 19 
Have You utterly rejected Judah? Has Your soul loathed Zion? Why have You stricken us so that _there is_ no healing for us? We looked for peace, but _there was_ no good; And for the time of healing, and there was trouble. 

###### 20 
We acknowledge, O Lord, our wickedness _And_ the iniquity of our fathers, For we have sinned against You. 

###### 21 
Do not abhor _us,_ for Your name's sake; Do not disgrace the throne of Your glory. Remember, do not break Your covenant with us. 

###### 22 
Are there any among the idols of the nations that can cause rain? Or can the heavens give showers? _Are_ You not He, O Lord our God? Therefore we will wait for You, Since You have made all these. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

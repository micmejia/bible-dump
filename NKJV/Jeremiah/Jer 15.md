# Jeremiah 15

***


###### 1 
Then the Lord said to me, "_Even_ if Moses and Samuel stood before Me, My mind _would_ not _be_ favorable toward this people. Cast _them_ out of My sight, and let them go forth. 

###### 2 
And it shall be, if they say to you, 'Where should we go?' then you shall tell them, 'Thus says the Lord: "Such as _are_ for death, to death; And such as _are_ for the sword, to the sword; And such as _are_ for the famine, to the famine; And such as _are_ for the captivity, to the captivity." ' 

###### 3 
"And I will appoint over them four forms _of destruction,_" says the Lord: "the sword to slay, the dogs to drag, the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the earth to devour and destroy. 

###### 4 
I will hand them over to trouble, to all kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, for what he did in Jerusalem. 

###### 5 
"For who will have pity on you, O Jerusalem? Or who will bemoan you? Or who will turn aside to ask how you are doing? 

###### 6 
You have forsaken Me," says the Lord, "You have gone backward. Therefore I will stretch out My hand against you and destroy you; I am weary of relenting! 

###### 7 
And I will winnow them with a winnowing fan in the gates of the land; I will bereave _them_ of children; I will destroy My people, _Since_ they do not return from their ways. 

###### 8 
Their widows will be increased to Me more than the sand of the seas; I will bring against them, Against the mother of the young men, A plunderer at noonday; I will cause anguish and terror to fall on them suddenly. 

###### 9 
"She languishes who has borne seven; She has breathed her last; Her sun has gone down While _it was_ yet day; She has been ashamed and confounded. And the remnant of them I will deliver to the sword Before their enemies," says the Lord. ## Jeremiah's Dejection 

###### 10 
Woe is me, my mother, That you have borne me, A man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent for interest, Nor have men lent to me for interest. Every one of them curses me. 

###### 11 
The Lord said: "Surely it will be well with your remnant; Surely I will cause the enemy to intercede with you In the time of adversity and in the time of affliction. 

###### 12 
Can anyone break iron, The northern iron and the bronze? 

###### 13 
Your wealth and your treasures I will give as plunder without price, Because of all your sins, Throughout your territories. 

###### 14 
And I will make _you_ cross over with your enemies Into a land _which_ you do not know; For a fire is kindled in My anger, _Which_ shall burn upon you." 

###### 15 
O Lord, You know; Remember me and visit me, And take vengeance for me on my persecutors. In Your enduring patience, do not take me away. Know that for Your sake I have suffered rebuke. 

###### 16 
Your words were found, and I ate them, And Your word was to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart; For I am called by Your name, O Lord God of hosts. 

###### 17 
I did not sit in the assembly of the mockers, Nor did I rejoice; I sat alone because of Your hand, For You have filled me with indignation. 

###### 18 
Why is my pain perpetual And my wound incurable, _Which_ refuses to be healed? Will You surely be to me like an unreliable stream, _As_ waters _that_ fail? ## The Lord Reassures Jeremiah 

###### 19 
Therefore thus says the Lord: "If you return, Then I will bring you back; You shall stand before Me; If you take out the precious from the vile, You shall be as My mouth. Let them return to you, But you must not return to them. 

###### 20 
And I will make you to this people a fortified bronze wall; And they will fight against you, But they shall not prevail against you; For I _am_ with you to save you And deliver you," says the Lord. 

###### 21 
"I will deliver you from the hand of the wicked, And I will redeem you from the grip of the terrible."

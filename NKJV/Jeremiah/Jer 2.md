# Jeremiah 2

***


###### 1 
Moreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying, 

###### 2 
"Go and cry in the hearing of Jerusalem, saying, 'Thus says the Lord: "I remember you, The kindness of your youth, The love of your betrothal, When you went after Me in the wilderness, In a land not sown. 

###### 3 
Israel _was_ holiness to the Lord, The firstfruits of His increase. All that devour him will offend; Disaster will come upon them," says the Lord.' " 

###### 4 
Hear the word of the Lord, O house of Jacob and all the families of the house of Israel. 

###### 5 
Thus says the Lord: "What injustice have your fathers found in Me, That they have gone far from Me, Have followed idols, And have become idolaters? 

###### 6 
Neither did they say, 'Where _is_ the Lord, Who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, Who led us through the wilderness, Through a land of deserts and pits, Through a land of drought and the shadow of death, Through a land that no one crossed And where no one dwelt?' 

###### 7 
I brought you into a bountiful country, To eat its fruit and its goodness. But when you entered, you defiled My land And made My heritage an abomination. 

###### 8 
The priests did not say, 'Where _is_ the Lord?' And those who handle the law did not know Me; The rulers also transgressed against Me; The prophets prophesied by Baal, And walked after _things that_ do not profit. 

###### 9 
"Therefore I will yet bring charges against you," says the Lord, "And against your children's children I will bring charges. 

###### 10 
For pass beyond the coasts of Cyprus and see, Send to Kedar and consider diligently, And see if there has been such _a_ _thing._ 

###### 11 
Has a nation changed _its_ gods, Which _are_ not gods? But My people have changed their Glory For _what_ does not profit. 

###### 12 
Be astonished, O heavens, at this, And be horribly afraid; Be very desolate," says the Lord. 

###### 13 
"For My people have committed two evils: They have forsaken Me, the fountain of living waters, _And_ hewn themselves cisterns--broken cisterns that can hold no water. 

###### 14 
"_Is_ Israel a servant? _Is_ he a homeborn _slave?_ Why is he plundered? 

###### 15 
The young lions roared at him, _and_ growled; They made his land waste; His cities are burned, without inhabitant. 

###### 16 
Also the people of Noph and Tahpanhes Have broken the crown of your head. 

###### 17 
Have you not brought this on yourself, In that you have forsaken the Lord your God When He led you in the way? 

###### 18 
And now why take the road to Egypt, To drink the waters of Sihor? Or why take the road to Assyria, To drink the waters of the River? 

###### 19 
Your own wickedness will correct you, And your backslidings will rebuke you. Know therefore and see that _it is_ an evil and bitter _thing_ That you have forsaken the Lord your God, And the fear of Me _is_ not in you," Says the Lord God of hosts. 

###### 20 
"For of old I have broken your yoke _and_ burst your bonds; And you said, 'I will not transgress,' When on every high hill and under every green tree You lay down, playing the harlot. 

###### 21 
Yet I had planted you a noble vine, a seed of highest quality. How then have you turned before Me Into the degenerate plant of an alien vine? 

###### 22 
For though you wash yourself with lye, and use much soap, _Yet_ your iniquity is marked before Me," says the Lord God. 

###### 23 
"How can you say, 'I am not polluted, I have not gone after the Baals'? See your way in the valley; Know what you have done: _You are_ a swift dromedary breaking loose in her ways, 

###### 24 
A wild donkey used to the wilderness, _That_ sniffs at the wind in her desire; In her time of mating, who can turn her away? All those who seek her will not weary themselves; In her month they will find her. 

###### 25 
Withhold your foot from being unshod, and your throat from thirst. But you said, 'There is no hope. No! For I have loved aliens, and after them I will go.' 

###### 26 
"As the thief is ashamed when he is found out, So is the house of Israel ashamed; They and their kings and their princes, and their priests and their prophets, 

###### 27 
Saying to a tree, 'You _are_ my father,' And to a stone, 'You gave birth to me.' For they have turned _their_ back to Me, and not _their_ face. But in the time of their trouble They will say, 'Arise and save us.' 

###### 28 
But where _are_ your gods that you have made for yourselves? Let them arise, If they can save you in the time of your trouble; For _according to_ the number of your cities Are your gods, O Judah. 

###### 29 
"Why will you plead with Me? You all have transgressed against Me," says the Lord. 

###### 30 
"In vain I have chastened your children; They received no correction. Your sword has devoured your prophets Like a destroying lion. 

###### 31 
"O generation, see the word of the Lord! Have I been a wilderness to Israel, Or a land of darkness? Why do My people say, 'We are lords; We will come no more to You'? 

###### 32 
Can a virgin forget her ornaments, _Or_ a bride her attire? Yet My people have forgotten Me days without number. 

###### 33 
"Why do you beautify your way to seek love? Therefore you have also taught The wicked women your ways. 

###### 34 
Also on your skirts is found The blood of the lives of the poor innocents. I have not found it by secret search, But plainly on all these things. 

###### 35 
Yet you say, 'Because I am innocent, Surely His anger shall turn from me.' Behold, I will plead My case against you, Because you say, 'I have not sinned.' 

###### 36 
Why do you gad about so much to change your way? Also you shall be ashamed of Egypt as you were ashamed of Assyria. 

###### 37 
Indeed you will go forth from him With your hands on your head; For the Lord has rejected your trusted allies, And you will not prosper by them.

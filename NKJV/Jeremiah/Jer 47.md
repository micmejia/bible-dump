# Jeremiah 47

***


###### 1 
The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Philistines, before Pharaoh attacked Gaza. 

###### 2 
Thus says the Lord: "Behold, waters rise out of the north, And shall be an overflowing flood; They shall overflow the land and all that is in it, The city and those who dwell within; Then the men shall cry, And all the inhabitants of the land shall wail. 

###### 3 
At the noise of the stamping hooves of his strong horses, At the rushing of his chariots, _At_ the rumbling of his wheels, The fathers will not look back for _their_ children, [^a]Lacking courage, 

###### 4 
Because of the day that comes to plunder all the Philistines, To cut off from Tyre and Sidon every helper who remains; For the Lord shall plunder the Philistines, The remnant of the country of Caphtor.[^b] 

###### 5 
Baldness has come upon Gaza, Ashkelon is cut off _With_ the remnant of their valley. How long will you cut yourself? 

###### 6 
"O you sword of the Lord, How long until you are quiet? Put yourself up into your scabbard, Rest and be still! 

###### 7 
How can [^c]it be quiet, Seeing the Lord has given it a charge Against Ashkelon and against the seashore? There He has appointed it." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

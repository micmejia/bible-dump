# Jeremiah 6

***


###### 1 
"O you children of Benjamin, Gather yourselves to flee from the midst of Jerusalem! Blow the trumpet in Tekoa, And set up a signal-fire in Beth Haccerem; For disaster appears out of the north, And great destruction. 

###### 2 
I have likened the daughter of Zion To a lovely and delicate woman. 

###### 3 
The shepherds with their flocks shall come to her. They shall pitch _their_ tents against her all around. Each one shall pasture in his own place." 

###### 4 
"Prepare war against her; Arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe to us, for the day goes away, For the shadows of the evening are lengthening. 

###### 5 
Arise, and let us go by night, And let us destroy her palaces." 

###### 6 
For thus has the Lord of hosts said: "Cut down trees, And build a mound against Jerusalem. This _is_ the city to be punished. She _is_ full of oppression in her midst. 

###### 7 
As a fountain [^a]wells up with water, So she wells up with her wickedness. Violence and plundering are heard in her. Before Me continually _are_ [^b]grief and wounds. 

###### 8 
Be instructed, O Jerusalem, Lest My soul depart from you; Lest I make you desolate, A land not inhabited." 

###### 9 
Thus says the Lord of hosts: "They shall thoroughly glean as a vine the remnant of Israel; As a grape-gatherer, put your hand back into the branches." 

###### 10 
To whom shall I speak and give warning, That they may hear? Indeed their ear _is_ uncircumcised, And they cannot give heed. Behold, the word of the Lord is a reproach to them; They have no delight in it. 

###### 11 
Therefore I am full of the fury of the Lord. I am weary of holding _it_ in. "I will pour it out on the children outside, And on the assembly of young men together; For even the husband shall be taken with the wife, The aged with _him who is_ full of days. 

###### 12 
And their houses shall be turned over to others, Fields and wives together; For I will stretch out My hand Against the inhabitants of the land," says the Lord. 

###### 13 
"Because from the least of them even to the greatest of them, Everyone _is_ given to covetousness; And from the prophet even to the priest, Everyone deals falsely. 

###### 14 
They have also healed the [^c]hurt of My people [^d]slightly, Saying, 'Peace, peace!' When _there is_ no peace. 

###### 15 
Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? No! They were not at all ashamed; Nor did they know how to blush. Therefore they shall fall among those who fall; At the time I punish them, They shall be cast down," says the Lord. 

###### 16 
Thus says the Lord: "Stand in the ways and see, And ask for the old paths, where the good way _is,_ And walk in it; Then you will find rest for your souls. But they said, 'We will not walk _in it._' 

###### 17 
Also, I set watchmen over you, _saying,_ 'Listen to the sound of the trumpet!' But they said, 'We will not listen.' 

###### 18 
Therefore hear, you nations, And know, O congregation, what _is_ among them. 

###### 19 
Hear, O earth! Behold, I will certainly bring calamity on this people-- The fruit of their thoughts, Because they have not heeded My words Nor My law, but rejected it. 

###### 20 
For what purpose to Me Comes frankincense from Sheba, And sweet cane from a far country? Your burnt offerings _are_ not acceptable, Nor your sacrifices sweet to Me." 

###### 21 
Therefore thus says the Lord: "Behold, I will lay stumbling blocks before this people, And the fathers and the sons together shall fall on them. The neighbor and his friend shall perish." 

###### 22 
Thus says the Lord: "Behold, a people comes from the north country, And a great nation will be raised from the farthest parts of the earth. 

###### 23 
They will lay hold on bow and spear; They _are_ cruel and have no mercy; Their voice roars like the sea; And they ride on horses, As men of war set in array against you, O daughter of Zion." 

###### 24 
We have heard the report of it; Our hands grow feeble. Anguish has taken hold of us, Pain as of a woman in [^e]labor. 

###### 25 
Do not go out into the field, Nor walk by the way. Because of the sword of the enemy, Fear _is_ on every side. 

###### 26 
O daughter of my people, Dress in sackcloth And roll about in ashes! Make mourning _as for_ an only son, most bitter lamentation; For the plunderer will suddenly come upon us. 

###### 27 
"I have set you _as_ an assayer _and_ a fortress among My people, That you may know and test their way. 

###### 28 
They _are_ all stubborn rebels, walking as slanderers. _They are_ bronze and iron, They _are_ all corrupters; 

###### 29 
The bellows blow fiercely, The lead is consumed by the fire; The smelter refines in vain, For the wicked are not drawn off. 

###### 30 
_People_ will call them rejected silver, Because the Lord has rejected them." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Job 10

***


###### 1 
"My soul loathes my life; I will give free course to my complaint, I will speak in the bitterness of my soul. 

###### 2 
I will say to God, 'Do not condemn me; Show me why You contend with me. 

###### 3 
_Does it_ seem good to You that You should oppress, That You should despise the work of Your hands, And smile on the counsel of the wicked? 

###### 4 
Do You have eyes of flesh? Or do You see as man sees? 

###### 5 
_Are_ Your days like the days of a mortal man? _Are_ Your years like the days of a mighty man, 

###### 6 
That You should seek for my iniquity And search out my sin, 

###### 7 
Although You know that I am not wicked, And _there is_ no one who can deliver from Your hand? 

###### 8 
'Your hands have made me and fashioned me, An intricate unity; Yet You would destroy me. 

###### 9 
Remember, I pray, that You have made me like clay. And will You turn me into dust again? 

###### 10 
Did You not pour me out like milk, And curdle me like cheese, 

###### 11 
Clothe me with skin and flesh, And knit me together with bones and sinews? 

###### 12 
You have granted me life and favor, And Your care has preserved my spirit. 

###### 13 
'And these _things_ You have hidden in Your heart; I know that this _was_ with You: 

###### 14 
If I sin, then You mark me, And will not acquit me of my iniquity. 

###### 15 
If I am wicked, woe to me; Even _if_ I am righteous, I cannot lift up my head. _I am_ full of disgrace; See my misery! 

###### 16 
If _my head_ is exalted, You hunt me like a fierce lion, And again You show Yourself awesome against me. 

###### 17 
You renew Your witnesses against me, And increase Your indignation toward me; Changes and war are _ever_ with me. 

###### 18 
'Why then have You brought me out of the womb? Oh, that I had perished and no eye had seen me! 

###### 19 
I would have been as though I had not been. I would have been carried from the womb to the grave. 

###### 20 
Are not my days few? Cease! Leave me alone, that I may take a little comfort, 

###### 21 
Before I go _to the place from which_ I shall not return, To the land of darkness and the shadow of death, 

###### 22 
A land as dark as darkness _itself,_ As the shadow of death, without any order, _Where_ even the light _is_ like darkness.' "

# Job 11

***


###### 1 
Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said: 

###### 2 
"Should not the multitude of words be answered? And should [^a]a man full of talk be vindicated? 

###### 3 
Should your empty talk make men [^b]hold their peace? And when you mock, should no one rebuke you? 

###### 4 
For you have said, 'My doctrine _is_ pure, And I am clean in your eyes.' 

###### 5 
But oh, that God would speak, And open His lips against you, 

###### 6 
That He would show you the secrets of wisdom! For _they would_ double _your_ prudence. Know therefore that God [^c]exacts from you _Less_ than your iniquity _deserves._ 

###### 7 
"Can you search out the deep things of God? Can you find out the limits of the Almighty? 

###### 8 
_They are_ higher than heaven--what can you do? Deeper than [^d]Sheol--what can you know? 

###### 9 
Their measure _is_ longer than the earth And broader than the sea. 

###### 10 
"If He passes by, imprisons, and gathers _to judgment,_ Then who can [^e]hinder Him? 

###### 11 
For He knows deceitful men; He sees wickedness also. Will He not then consider _it?_ 

###### 12 
For an empty-headed man will be wise, When a wild donkey's colt is born a man. 

###### 13 
"If you would prepare your heart, And stretch out your hands toward Him; 

###### 14 
If iniquity _were_ in your hand, _and you_ put it far away, And would not let wickedness dwell in your tents; 

###### 15 
Then surely you could lift up your face without spot; Yes, you could be steadfast, and not fear; 

###### 16 
Because you would forget _your_ misery, And remember _it_ as waters _that have_ passed away, 

###### 17 
And _your_ life would be brighter than noonday. _Though_ you were dark, you would be like the morning. 

###### 18 
And you would be secure, because there is hope; Yes, you would dig _around you, and_ take your rest in safety. 

###### 19 
You would also lie down, and no one would make _you_ afraid; _Yes,_ many would court your favor. 

###### 20 
But the eyes of the wicked will fail, And they shall not escape, And their hope--[^f]loss of life!" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

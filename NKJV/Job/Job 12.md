# Job 12

***


###### 1 
Then Job answered and said: 

###### 2 
"No doubt you _are_ the people, And wisdom will die with you! 

###### 3 
But I have [^a]understanding as well as you; I _am_ not inferior to you. Indeed, who does not _know_ such things as these? 

###### 4 
"I am one mocked by his friends, Who called on God, and He answered him, The just and blameless _who is_ ridiculed. 

###### 5 
A [^b]lamp is despised in the thought of one who is at ease; _It is_ made ready for those whose feet slip. 

###### 6 
The tents of robbers prosper, And those who provoke God are secure-- In what God provides by His hand. 

###### 7 
"But now ask the beasts, and they will teach you; And the birds of the air, and they will tell you; 

###### 8 
Or speak to the earth, and it will teach you; And the fish of the sea will explain to you. 

###### 9 
Who among all these does not know That the hand of the Lord has done this, 

###### 10 
In whose hand _is_ the [^c]life of every living thing, And the breath of [^d]all mankind? 

###### 11 
Does not the ear test words And the [^e]mouth taste its food? 

###### 12 
Wisdom _is_ with aged men, And with [^f]length of days, understanding. 

###### 13 
"With Him _are_ wisdom and strength, He has counsel and understanding. 

###### 14 
If He breaks _a thing_ down, it cannot be rebuilt; _If_ He imprisons a man, there can be no release. 

###### 15 
If He withholds the waters, they dry up; _If_ He sends them out, they overwhelm the earth. 

###### 16 
With Him _are_ strength and prudence. The deceived and the deceiver _are_ His. 

###### 17 
He leads counselors away plundered, And makes fools of the judges. 

###### 18 
He loosens the bonds of kings, And binds their waist with a belt. 

###### 19 
He leads [^g]princes away plundered, And overthrows the mighty. 

###### 20 
He deprives the trusted ones of speech, And takes away the discernment of the elders. 

###### 21 
He pours contempt on princes, And [^h]disarms the mighty. 

###### 22 
He uncovers deep things out of darkness, And brings the shadow of death to light. 

###### 23 
He makes nations great, and destroys them; He [^i]enlarges nations, and guides them. 

###### 24 
He takes away the [^j]understanding of the chiefs of the people of the earth, And makes them wander in a pathless wilderness. 

###### 25 
They grope in the dark without light, And He makes them stagger like a drunken _man._

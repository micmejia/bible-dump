# Job 14

***


###### 1 
"Man _who is_ born of woman Is of few days and full of [^a]trouble. 

###### 2 
He comes forth like a flower and fades away; He flees like a shadow and does not continue. 

###### 3 
And do You open Your eyes on such a one, And bring [^b]me to judgment with Yourself? 

###### 4 
Who can bring a clean _thing_ out of an unclean? No one! 

###### 5 
Since his days _are_ determined, The number of his months _is_ with You; You have appointed his limits, so that he cannot pass. 

###### 6 
Look away from him that he may [^c]rest, Till like a hired man he finishes his day. 

###### 7 
"For there is hope for a tree, If it is cut down, that it will sprout again, And that its tender shoots will not cease. 

###### 8 
Though its root may grow old in the earth, And its stump may die in the ground, 

###### 9 
_Yet_ at the scent of water it will bud And bring forth branches like a plant. 

###### 10 
But man dies and [^d]is laid away; Indeed he [^e]breathes his last And where _is_ he? 

###### 11 
_As_ water disappears from the sea, And a river becomes parched and dries up, 

###### 12 
So man lies down and does not rise. Till the heavens _are_ no more, They will not awake Nor be roused from their sleep. 

###### 13 
"Oh, that You would hide me in the grave, That You would conceal me until Your wrath is past, That You would appoint me a set time, and remember me! 

###### 14 
If a man dies, shall he live _again?_ All the days of my hard service I will wait, Till my change comes. 

###### 15 
You shall call, and I will answer You; You shall desire the work of Your hands. 

###### 16 
For now You number my steps, But do not watch over my sin. 

###### 17 
My transgression _is_ sealed up in a bag, And You [^f]cover my iniquity. 

###### 18 
"But _as_ a mountain falls _and_ crumbles away, And _as_ a rock is moved from its place; 

###### 19 
_As_ water wears away stones, _And as_ torrents wash away the soil of the earth; So You destroy the hope of man. 

###### 20 
You prevail forever against him, and he passes on; You change his countenance and send him away. 

###### 21 
His sons come to honor, and he does not know _it;_ They are brought low, and he does not perceive _it._ 

###### 22 
But his flesh will be in pain over it, And his soul will mourn over it."

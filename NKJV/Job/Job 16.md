# Job 16

***


###### 1 
Then Job answered and said: 

###### 2 
"I have heard many such things; Miserable comforters _are_ you all! 

###### 3 
Shall words of wind have an end? Or what provokes you that you answer? 

###### 4 
I also could speak as you _do,_ If your soul were in my soul's place. I could heap up words against you, And shake my head at you; 

###### 5 
_But_ I would strengthen you with my mouth, And the comfort of my lips would relieve _your grief._ 

###### 6 
"Though I speak, my grief is not relieved; And _if_ I remain silent, how am I eased? 

###### 7 
But now He has worn me out; You have made desolate all my company. 

###### 8 
You have shriveled me up, And it is a witness _against me;_ My leanness rises up against me _And_ bears witness to my face. 

###### 9 
He tears _me_ in His wrath, and hates me; He gnashes at me with His teeth; My adversary sharpens His gaze on me. 

###### 10 
They gape at me with their mouth, They strike me reproachfully on the cheek, They gather together against me. 

###### 11 
God has delivered me to the ungodly, And turned me over to the hands of the wicked. 

###### 12 
I was at ease, but He has shattered me; He also has taken _me_ by my neck, and shaken me to pieces; He has set me up for His target, 

###### 13 
His archers surround me. He pierces my heart and does not pity; He pours out my gall on the ground. 

###### 14 
He breaks me with wound upon wound; He runs at me like a warrior. 

###### 15 
"I have sewn sackcloth over my skin, And laid my head in the dust. 

###### 16 
My face is flushed from weeping, And on my eyelids _is_ the shadow of death; 

###### 17 
Although no violence _is_ in my hands, And my prayer _is_ pure. 

###### 18 
"O earth, do not cover my blood, And let my cry have no _resting_ place! 

###### 19 
Surely even now my witness _is_ in heaven, And my evidence _is_ on high. 

###### 20 
My friends scorn me; My eyes pour out _tears_ to God. 

###### 21 
Oh, that one might plead for a man with God, As a man _pleads_ for his neighbor! 

###### 22 
For when a few years are finished, I shall go the way of no return.

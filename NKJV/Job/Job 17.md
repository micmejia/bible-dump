# Job 17

***


###### 1 
"My spirit is broken, My days are extinguished, The grave _is ready_ for me. 

###### 2 
_Are_ not mockers with me? And does not my eye [^a]dwell on their provocation? 

###### 3 
"Now put down a pledge for me with Yourself. Who _is_ he _who_ will shake hands with me? 

###### 4 
For You have hidden their heart from understanding; Therefore You will not exalt _them._ 

###### 5 
He who speaks flattery to _his_ friends, Even the eyes of his children will fail. 

###### 6 
"But He has made me a byword of the people, And I have become one in whose face men spit. 

###### 7 
My eye has also grown dim because of sorrow, And all my members _are_ like shadows. 

###### 8 
Upright _men_ are astonished at this, And the innocent stirs himself up against the hypocrite. 

###### 9 
Yet the righteous will hold to his way, And he who has clean hands will be stronger and stronger. 

###### 10 
"But please, come back again, [^b]all of you, For I shall not find _one_ wise _man_ among you. 

###### 11 
My days are past, My purposes are broken off, _Even_ the [^c]thoughts of my heart. 

###### 12 
They change the night into day; 'The light _is_ near,' _they say,_ in the face of darkness. 

###### 13 
If I wait _for_ the grave _as_ my house, If I make my bed in the darkness, 

###### 14 
If I say to corruption, 'You _are_ my father,' And to the worm, 'You _are_ my mother and my sister,' 

###### 15 
Where then _is_ my hope? As for my hope, who can see it? 

###### 16 
_Will_ they go down to the gates of [^d]Sheol? Shall _we have_ rest together in the dust?"

# Job 18

***


###### 1 
Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said: 

###### 2 
"How long _till_ you put an end to words? Gain understanding, and afterward we will speak. 

###### 3 
Why are we counted as beasts, _And_ regarded as stupid in your sight? 

###### 4 
You[^a] who tear yourself in anger, Shall the earth be forsaken for you? Or shall the rock be removed from its place? 

###### 5 
"The light of the wicked indeed goes out, And the flame of his fire does not shine. 

###### 6 
The light is dark in his tent, And his lamp beside him is put out. 

###### 7 
The steps of his strength are shortened, And his own counsel casts him down. 

###### 8 
For he is cast into a net by his own feet, And he walks into a snare. 

###### 9 
The net takes _him_ by the heel, _And_ a snare lays hold of him. 

###### 10 
A noose _is_ hidden for him on the ground, And a trap for him in the road. 

###### 11 
Terrors frighten him on every side, And drive him to his feet. 

###### 12 
His strength is starved, And destruction _is_ ready at his side. 

###### 13 
It devours patches of his skin; The firstborn of death devours his [^b]limbs. 

###### 14 
He is uprooted from the shelter of his tent, And they parade him before the king of terrors. 

###### 15 
They dwell in his tent _who are_ none of his; Brimstone is scattered on his dwelling. 

###### 16 
His roots are dried out below, And his branch withers above. 

###### 17 
The memory of him perishes from the earth, And he has no name [^c]among the renowned. 

###### 18 
[^d]He is driven from light into darkness, And chased out of the world. 

###### 19 
He has neither son nor posterity among his people, Nor any remaining in his dwellings. 

###### 20 
Those [^e]in the west are astonished at his day, As those [^f]in the east are frightened. 

###### 21 
Surely such _are_ the dwellings of the wicked, And this _is_ the place _of him who_ does not know God."

# Job 19

***


###### 1 
Then Job answered and said: 

###### 2 
"How long will you torment my soul, And break me in pieces with words? 

###### 3 
These ten times you have [^a]reproached me; You are not ashamed _that_ you [^b]have wronged me. 

###### 4 
And if indeed I have erred, My error remains with me. 

###### 5 
If indeed you exalt _yourselves_ against me, And plead my disgrace against me, 

###### 6 
Know then that God has wronged me, And has surrounded me with His net. 

###### 7 
"If I cry out concerning [^c]wrong, I am not heard. If I cry aloud, _there is_ no justice. 

###### 8 
He has [^d]fenced up my way, so that I cannot pass; And He has set darkness in my paths. 

###### 9 
He has stripped me of my glory, And taken the crown _from_ my head. 

###### 10 
He breaks me down on every side, And I am gone; My hope He has uprooted like a tree. 

###### 11 
He has also kindled His wrath against me, And He counts me as _one of_ His enemies. 

###### 12 
His troops come together And build up their road against me; They encamp all around my tent. 

###### 13 
"He has removed my brothers far from me, And my acquaintances are completely estranged from me. 

###### 14 
My relatives have failed, And my close friends have forgotten me. 

###### 15 
Those who dwell in my house, and my maidservants, Count me as a stranger; I am an alien in their sight. 

###### 16 
I call my servant, but he gives no answer; I beg him with my mouth. 

###### 17 
My breath is offensive to my wife, And I am [^e]repulsive to the children of my own body. 

###### 18 
Even young children despise me; I arise, and they speak against me. 

###### 19 
All my close friends abhor me, And those whom I love have turned against me. 

###### 20 
My bone clings to my skin and to my flesh, And I have escaped by the skin of my teeth. 

###### 21 
"Have pity on me, have pity on me, O you my friends, For the hand of God has struck me! 

###### 22 
Why do you persecute me as God _does,_ And are not satisfied with my flesh? 

###### 23 
"Oh, that my words were written! Oh, that they were inscribed in a book! 

###### 24 
That they were engraved on a rock With an iron pen and lead, forever! 

###### 25 
For I know _that_ my Redeemer lives, And He shall stand at last on the earth; 

###### 26 
And after my skin is [^f]destroyed, this _I know,_ That in my flesh I shall see God, 

###### 27 
Whom I shall see for myself, And my eyes shall behold, and not another. _How_ my [^g]heart yearns within me! 

###### 28 
If you should say, 'How shall we persecute him?'-- Since the root of the matter is found in me, 

###### 29 
Be afraid of the sword for yourselves; For wrath _brings_ the punishment of the sword, That you may know _there is_ a judgment."

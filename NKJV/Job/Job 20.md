# Job 20

***


###### 1 
Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said: 

###### 2 
"Therefore my anxious thoughts make me answer, Because of the turmoil within me. 

###### 3 
I have heard the rebuke that reproaches me, And the spirit of my understanding causes me to answer. 

###### 4 
"Do you _not_ know this of old, Since man was placed on earth, 

###### 5 
That the triumphing of the wicked is short, And the joy of the hypocrite is _but_ for a moment? 

###### 6 
Though his haughtiness mounts up to the heavens, And his head reaches to the clouds, 

###### 7 
_Yet_ he will perish forever like his own refuse; Those who have seen him will say, 'Where is he?' 

###### 8 
He will fly away like a dream, and not be found; Yes, he will be chased away like a vision of the night. 

###### 9 
The eye _that_ saw him will _see him_ no more, Nor will his place behold him anymore. 

###### 10 
His children will seek the favor of the poor, And his hands will restore his wealth. 

###### 11 
His bones are full of his youthful vigor, But it will lie down with him in the dust. 

###### 12 
"Though evil is sweet in his mouth, _And_ he hides it under his tongue, 

###### 13 
_Though_ he spares it and does not forsake it, But still keeps it in his mouth, 

###### 14 
_Yet_ his food in his stomach turns sour; It becomes cobra venom within him. 

###### 15 
He swallows down riches And vomits them up again; God casts them out of his belly. 

###### 16 
He will suck the poison of cobras; The viper's tongue will slay him. 

###### 17 
He will not see the streams, The rivers flowing with honey and cream. 

###### 18 
He will restore that for which he labored, And will not swallow _it_ down; From the proceeds of business He will get no enjoyment. 

###### 19 
For he has oppressed _and_ forsaken the poor, He has violently seized a house which he did not build. 

###### 20 
"Because he knows no quietness in his heart, He will not save anything he desires. 

###### 21 
Nothing is left for him to eat; Therefore his well-being will not last. 

###### 22 
In his self-sufficiency he will be in distress; Every hand of misery will come against him. 

###### 23 
_When_ he is about to fill his stomach, _God_ will cast on him the fury of His wrath, And will rain _it_ on him while he is eating. 

###### 24 
He will flee from the iron weapon; A bronze bow will pierce him through. 

###### 25 
It is drawn, and comes out of the body; Yes, the glittering _point comes_ out of his gall. Terrors _come_ upon him; 

###### 26 
Total darkness _is_ reserved for his treasures. An unfanned fire will consume him; It shall go ill with him who is left in his tent. 

###### 27 
The heavens will reveal his iniquity, And the earth will rise up against him. 

###### 28 
The increase of his house will depart, _And his goods_ will flow away in the day of His wrath. 

###### 29 
This _is_ the portion from God for a wicked man, The heritage appointed to him by God."

# Job 21

***


###### 1 
Then Job answered and said: 

###### 2 
"Listen carefully to my speech, And let this be your [^a]consolation. 

###### 3 
Bear with me that I may speak, And after I have spoken, keep mocking. 

###### 4 
"As for me, _is_ my complaint against man? And if _it were,_ why should I not be impatient? 

###### 5 
Look at me and be astonished; Put _your_ hand over _your_ mouth. 

###### 6 
Even when I remember I am terrified, And trembling takes hold of my flesh. 

###### 7 
Why do the wicked live _and_ become old, Yes, become mighty in power? 

###### 8 
Their descendants are established with them in their sight, And their offspring before their eyes. 

###### 9 
Their houses _are_ safe from fear, Neither _is_ [^b]the rod of God upon them. 

###### 10 
Their bull breeds without failure; Their cow calves without miscarriage. 

###### 11 
They send forth their little ones like a flock, And their children dance. 

###### 12 
They sing to the tambourine and harp, And rejoice to the sound of the flute. 

###### 13 
They spend their days in wealth, And [^c]in a moment go down to the [^d]grave. 

###### 14 
Yet they say to God, 'Depart from us, For we do not desire the knowledge of Your ways. 

###### 15 
Who _is_ the Almighty, that we should serve Him? And what profit do we have if we pray to Him?' 

###### 16 
Indeed [^e]their prosperity _is_ not in their hand; The counsel of the wicked is far from me. 

###### 17 
"How often is the lamp of the wicked put out? _How often_ does their destruction come upon them, The sorrows _God_ distributes in His anger? 

###### 18 
They are like straw before the wind, And like chaff that a storm [^f]carries away. 

###### 19 
_They say,_ 'God [^g]lays up [^h]one's iniquity for his children'; Let Him recompense him, that he may know _it._ 

###### 20 
Let his eyes see his destruction, And let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty. 

###### 21 
For what does he care about his household after him, When the number of his months is cut in half? 

###### 22 
"Can _anyone_ teach God knowledge, Since He judges those on high? 

###### 23 
One dies in his full strength, Being wholly at ease and secure; 

###### 24 
His [^i]pails are full of milk, And the marrow of his bones is moist. 

###### 25 
Another man dies in the bitterness of his soul, Never having eaten with pleasure. 

###### 26 
They lie down alike in the dust, And worms cover them. 

###### 27 
"Look, I know your thoughts, And the schemes _with which_ you would wrong me. 

###### 28 
For you say, 'Where _is_ the house of the prince? And where _is_ [^j]the tent, The dwelling place of the wicked?' 

###### 29 
Have you not asked those who travel the road? And do you not know their signs? 

###### 30 
For the wicked are reserved for the day of doom; They shall be brought out on the day of wrath. 

###### 31 
Who condemns his way to his face? And who repays him _for what_ he has done? 

###### 32 
Yet he shall be brought to the grave, And a vigil kept over the tomb. 

###### 33 
The clods of the valley shall be sweet to him; Everyone shall follow him, As countless _have gone_ before him. 

###### 34 
How then can you comfort me with empty words, Since [^k]falsehood remains in your answers?"

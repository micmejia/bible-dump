# Job 24

***


###### 1 
"_Since_ times are not hidden from the Almighty, Why do those who know Him see not His days? 

###### 2 
"_Some_ remove landmarks; They seize flocks violently and feed _on them;_ 

###### 3 
They drive away the donkey of the fatherless; They take the widow's ox as a pledge. 

###### 4 
They push the needy off the road; All the poor of the land are forced to hide. 

###### 5 
Indeed, _like_ wild donkeys in the desert, They go out to their work, searching for food. The wilderness _yields_ food for them _and_ for _their_ children. 

###### 6 
They gather their fodder in the field And glean in the vineyard of the wicked. 

###### 7 
They spend the night naked, without clothing, And have no covering in the cold. 

###### 8 
They are wet with the showers of the mountains, And huddle around the rock for want of shelter. 

###### 9 
"_Some_ snatch the fatherless from the breast, And take a pledge from the poor. 

###### 10 
They cause _the poor_ to go naked, without clothing; And they take away the sheaves from the hungry. 

###### 11 
They press out oil within their walls, And tread winepresses, yet suffer thirst. 

###### 12 
The dying groan in the city, And the souls of the wounded cry out; Yet God does not charge _them_ with wrong. 

###### 13 
"There are those who rebel against the light; They do not know its ways Nor abide in its paths. 

###### 14 
The murderer rises with the light; He kills the poor and needy; And in the night he is like a thief. 

###### 15 
The eye of the adulterer waits for the twilight, Saying, 'No eye will see me'; And he disguises _his_ face. 

###### 16 
In the dark they break into houses Which they marked for themselves in the daytime; They do not know the light. 

###### 17 
For the morning is the same to them as the shadow of death; If _someone_ recognizes _them,_ _They are in_ the terrors of the shadow of death. 

###### 18 
"They _should be_ swift on the face of the waters, Their portion _should be_ cursed in the earth, _So that_ no _one would_ turn into the way of their vineyards. 

###### 19 
As drought and heat consume the snow waters, _So_ the grave _consumes those who_ have sinned. 

###### 20 
The womb _should_ forget him, The worm _should_ feed sweetly on him; He _should_ be remembered no more, And wickedness _should_ be broken like a tree. 

###### 21 
For he preys on the barren _who_ do not bear, And does no good for the widow. 

###### 22 
"But _God_ draws the mighty away with His power; He rises up, but no _man_ is sure of life. 

###### 23 
He gives them security, and they rely _on it;_ Yet His eyes _are_ on their ways. 

###### 24 
They are exalted for a little while, Then they are gone. They are brought low; They are taken out of the way like all _others;_ They dry out like the heads of grain. 

###### 25 
"Now if _it is_ not _so,_ who will prove me a liar, And make my speech worth nothing?"

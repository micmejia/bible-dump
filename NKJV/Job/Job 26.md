# Job 26

***


###### 1 
But Job answered and said: 

###### 2 
"How have you helped _him who is_ without power? _How_ have you saved the arm _that has_ no strength? 

###### 3 
How have you counseled _one who has_ no wisdom? And _how_ have you declared sound advice to many? 

###### 4 
To whom have you uttered words? And whose spirit came from you? 

###### 5 
"The dead tremble, Those under the waters and those inhabiting them. 

###### 6 
Sheol _is_ naked before Him, And Destruction has no covering. 

###### 7 
He stretches out the north over empty space; _He_ hangs the earth on nothing. 

###### 8 
He binds up the water in His thick clouds, Yet the clouds are not broken under it. 

###### 9 
He covers the face of _His_ throne, _And_ spreads His cloud over it. 

###### 10 
He drew a circular horizon on the face of the waters, At the boundary of light and darkness. 

###### 11 
The pillars of heaven tremble, And are astonished at His rebuke. 

###### 12 
He stirs up the sea with His power, And by His understanding He breaks up the storm. 

###### 13 
By His Spirit He adorned the heavens; His hand pierced the fleeing serpent. 

###### 14 
Indeed these _are_ the mere edges of His ways, And how small a whisper we hear of Him! But the thunder of His power who can understand?"

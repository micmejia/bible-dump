# Job 28

***


###### 1 
"Surely there is a mine for silver, And a place _where_ gold is refined. 

###### 2 
Iron is taken from the earth, And copper _is_ smelted _from_ ore. 

###### 3 
_Man_ puts an end to darkness, And searches every recess For ore in the darkness and the shadow of death. 

###### 4 
He breaks open a shaft away from people; _In places_ forgotten by feet They hang far away from men; They swing to and fro. 

###### 5 
_As for_ the earth, from it comes bread, But underneath it is turned up as by fire; 

###### 6 
Its stones _are_ the source of sapphires, And it contains gold dust. 

###### 7 
_That_ path no bird knows, Nor has the falcon's eye seen it. 

###### 8 
The proud lions have not trodden it, Nor has the fierce lion passed over it. 

###### 9 
He puts his hand on the flint; He overturns the mountains at the roots. 

###### 10 
He cuts out channels in the rocks, And his eye sees every precious thing. 

###### 11 
He dams up the streams from trickling; _What is_ hidden he brings forth to light. 

###### 12 
"But where can wisdom be found? And where _is_ the place of understanding? 

###### 13 
Man does not know its value, Nor is it found in the land of the living. 

###### 14 
The deep says, '_It is_ not in me'; And the sea says, '_It is_ not with me.' 

###### 15 
It cannot be purchased for gold, Nor can silver be weighed _for_ its price. 

###### 16 
It cannot be valued in the gold of Ophir, In precious onyx or sapphire. 

###### 17 
Neither gold nor crystal can equal it, Nor can it be exchanged for jewelry of fine gold. 

###### 18 
No mention shall be made of coral or quartz, For the price of wisdom _is_ above rubies. 

###### 19 
The topaz of Ethiopia cannot equal it, Nor can it be valued in pure gold. 

###### 20 
"From where then does wisdom come? And where _is_ the place of understanding? 

###### 21 
It is hidden from the eyes of all living, And concealed from the birds of the air. 

###### 22 
Destruction and Death say, 'We have heard a report about it with our ears.' 

###### 23 
God understands its way, And He knows its place. 

###### 24 
For He looks to the ends of the earth, _And_ sees under the whole heavens, 

###### 25 
To establish a weight for the wind, And apportion the waters by measure. 

###### 26 
When He made a law for the rain, And a path for the thunderbolt, 

###### 27 
Then He saw _wisdom_ and declared it; He prepared it, indeed, He searched it out. 

###### 28 
And to man He said, 'Behold, the fear of the Lord, that _is_ wisdom, And to depart from evil _is_ understanding.' "

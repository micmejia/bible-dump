# Job 29

***


###### 1 
Job further continued his discourse, and said: 

###### 2 
"Oh, that I were as _in_ months past, As _in_ the days _when_ God watched over me; 

###### 3 
When His lamp shone upon my head, _And when_ by His light I walked _through_ darkness; 

###### 4 
Just as I was in the days of my prime, When the friendly counsel of God _was_ over my tent; 

###### 5 
When the Almighty _was_ yet with me, _When_ my children _were_ around me; 

###### 6 
When my steps were bathed with [^a]cream, And the rock poured out rivers of oil for me! 

###### 7 
"When I went out to the gate by the city, _When_ I took my seat in the open square, 

###### 8 
The young men saw me and hid, And the aged arose _and_ stood; 

###### 9 
The princes refrained from talking, And put _their_ hand on their mouth; 

###### 10 
The voice of nobles was hushed, And their tongue stuck to the roof of their mouth. 

###### 11 
When the ear heard, then it blessed me, And when the eye saw, then it approved me; 

###### 12 
Because I delivered the poor who cried out, The fatherless and _the one who_ had no helper. 

###### 13 
The blessing of a perishing _man_ came upon me, And I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy. 

###### 14 
I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; My justice _was_ like a robe and a turban. 

###### 15 
I _was_ eyes to the blind, And I _was_ feet to the lame. 

###### 16 
I _was_ a father to the poor, And I searched out the case _that_ I did not know. 

###### 17 
I broke the fangs of the wicked, And plucked the victim from his teeth. 

###### 18 
"Then I said, 'I shall die in my nest, And multiply _my_ days as the sand. 

###### 19 
My root _is_ spread out to the waters, And the dew lies all night on my branch. 

###### 20 
My glory _is_ fresh within me, And my bow is renewed in my hand.' 

###### 21 
"_Men_ listened to me and waited, And kept silence for my counsel. 

###### 22 
After my words they did not speak again, And my speech settled on them _as dew._ 

###### 23 
They waited for me _as_ for the rain, And they opened their mouth wide _as_ for the spring rain. 

###### 24 
_If_ I mocked at them, they did not believe _it,_ And the light of my countenance they did not cast down. 

###### 25 
I chose the way for them, and sat as chief; So I dwelt as a king in the army, As one _who_ comforts mourners.

# Job 3

***


###### 1 
After this Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his _birth._ 

###### 2 
And Job [^a]spoke, and said: 

###### 3 
"May the day perish on which I was born, And the night _in which_ it was said, 'A male child is conceived.' 

###### 4 
May that day be darkness; May God above not seek it, Nor the light shine upon it. 

###### 5 
May darkness and the shadow of death claim it; May a cloud settle on it; May the blackness of the day terrify it. 

###### 6 
_As for_ that night, may darkness seize it; May it not [^b]rejoice among the days of the year, May it not come into the number of the months. 

###### 7 
Oh, may that night be barren! May no joyful shout come into it! 

###### 8 
May those curse it who curse the day, Those who are ready to arouse Leviathan. 

###### 9 
May the stars of its morning be dark; May it look for light, but _have_ none, And not see the [^c]dawning of the day; 

###### 10 
Because it did not shut up the doors of my _mother's_ womb, Nor hide sorrow from my eyes. 

###### 11 
"Why did I not die at birth? _Why_ did I _not_ [^d]perish when I came from the womb? 

###### 12 
Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breasts, that I should nurse? 

###### 13 
For now I would have lain still and been quiet, I would have been asleep; Then I would have been at rest 

###### 14 
With kings and counselors of the earth, Who built ruins for themselves, 

###### 15 
Or with princes who had gold, Who filled their houses _with_ silver; 

###### 16 
Or _why_ was I not hidden like a stillborn child, Like infants who never saw light? 

###### 17 
There the wicked cease _from_ troubling, And there the [^e]weary are at rest. 

###### 18 
_There_ the prisoners [^f]rest together; They do not hear the voice of the oppressor. 

###### 19 
The small and great are there, And the servant _is_ free from his master. 

###### 20 
"Why is light given to him who is in misery, And life to the bitter of soul, 

###### 21 
Who long[^g] for death, but it does not _come,_ And search for it more than hidden treasures; 

###### 22 
Who rejoice exceedingly, _And_ are glad when they can find the grave? 

###### 23 
_Why is light given_ to a man whose way is hidden, And whom God has hedged in? 

###### 24 
For my sighing comes before [^h]I eat, And my groanings pour out like water. 

###### 25 
For the thing I greatly feared has come upon me, And what I dreaded has happened to me. 

###### 26 
I am not at ease, nor am I quiet; I have no rest, for trouble comes." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

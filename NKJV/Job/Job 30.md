# Job 30

***


###### 1 
"But now they mock at me, _men_ [^a]younger than I, Whose fathers I disdained to put with the dogs of my flock. 

###### 2 
Indeed, what _profit_ is the strength of their hands to me? Their vigor has perished. 

###### 3 
_They are_ gaunt from want and famine, Fleeing late to the wilderness, desolate and waste, 

###### 4 
Who pluck [^b]mallow by the bushes, And broom tree roots _for_ their food. 

###### 5 
They were driven out from among _men,_ They shouted at them as _at_ a thief. 

###### 6 
_They had_ to live in the clefts of the [^c]valleys, _In_ [^d]caves of the earth and the rocks. 

###### 7 
Among the bushes they brayed, Under the nettles they nestled. 

###### 8 
_They were_ sons of fools, Yes, sons of vile men; They were scourged from the land. 

###### 9 
"And now I am their taunting song; Yes, I am their byword. 

###### 10 
They abhor me, they keep far from me; They do not hesitate to spit in my face. 

###### 11 
Because He has loosed [^e]my bowstring and afflicted me, They have cast off restraint before me. 

###### 12 
At _my_ right _hand_ the rabble arises; They push away my feet, And they raise against me their ways of destruction. 

###### 13 
They break up my path, They promote my calamity; They have no helper. 

###### 14 
They come as broad breakers; Under the ruinous storm they roll along. 

###### 15 
Terrors are turned upon me; They pursue my honor as the wind, And my prosperity has passed like a cloud. 

###### 16 
"And now my soul is poured out because of my _plight;_ The days of affliction take hold of me. 

###### 17 
My bones are pierced in me at night, And my gnawing pains take no rest. 

###### 18 
By great force my garment is disfigured; It binds me about as the collar of my coat. 

###### 19 
He has cast me into the mire, And I have become like dust and ashes. 

###### 20 
"I cry out to You, but You do not answer me; I stand up, and You regard me. 

###### 21 
_But_ You have become cruel to me; With the strength of Your hand You oppose me. 

###### 22 
You lift me up to the wind and cause me to ride _on it;_ You spoil my success. 

###### 23 
For I know _that_ You will bring me _to_ death, And _to_ the house appointed for all living. 

###### 24 
"Surely He would not stretch out _His_ hand against a heap of ruins, If they cry out when He destroys _it._ 

###### 25 
Have I not wept for him who was in trouble? Has _not_ my soul grieved for the poor? 

###### 26 
But when I looked for good, evil came _to me;_ And when I waited for light, then came darkness. 

###### 27 
[^f]My heart is in turmoil and cannot rest; Days of affliction confront me. 

###### 28 
I go about mourning, but not in the sun; I stand up in the assembly _and_ cry out for help. 

###### 29 
I am a brother of jackals, And a companion of ostriches. 

###### 30 
My skin grows black and falls from me; My bones burn with fever. 

###### 31 
My harp is _turned_ to mourning, And my flute to the voice of those who weep.

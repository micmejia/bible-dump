# Job 31

***


###### 1 
"I have made a covenant with my eyes; Why then should I [^a]look upon a young woman? 

###### 2 
For what _is_ the allotment of God from above, And the inheritance of the Almighty from on high? 

###### 3 
_Is_ it not destruction for the wicked, And disaster for the workers of iniquity? 

###### 4 
Does He not see my ways, And count all my steps? 

###### 5 
"If I have walked with falsehood, Or if my foot has hastened to deceit, 

###### 6 
[^b]Let me be weighed on honest scales, That God may know my integrity. 

###### 7 
If my step has turned from the way, Or my heart walked after my eyes, Or if any spot adheres to my hands, 

###### 8 
_Then_ let me sow, and another eat; Yes, let my harvest be [^c]rooted out. 

###### 9 
"If my heart has been enticed by a woman, Or _if_ I have lurked at my neighbor's door, 

###### 10 
_Then_ let my wife grind for another, And let others bow down over her. 

###### 11 
For that _would be_ wickedness; Yes, it _would be_ iniquity _deserving of_ judgment. 

###### 12 
For that _would be_ a fire _that_ consumes to destruction, And would root out all my increase. 

###### 13 
"If I have despised the cause of my male or female servant When they complained against me, 

###### 14 
What then shall I do when God rises up? When He punishes, how shall I answer Him? 

###### 15 
Did not He who made me in the womb make them? Did not the same One fashion us in the womb? 

###### 16 
"If I have kept the poor from _their_ desire, Or caused the eyes of the widow to fail, 

###### 17 
Or eaten my morsel by myself, So that the fatherless could not eat of it 

###### 18 
(But from my youth I reared him as a father, And from my mother's womb I guided [^d]_the widow_); 

###### 19 
If I have seen anyone perish for lack of clothing, Or any poor _man_ without covering; 

###### 20 
If his [^e]heart has not blessed me, And _if_ he was _not_ warmed with the fleece of my sheep; 

###### 21 
If I have raised my hand against the fatherless, When I saw I had help in the gate; 

###### 22 
_Then_ let my arm fall from my shoulder, Let my arm be torn from the socket. 

###### 23 
For destruction _from_ God _is_ a terror to me, And because of His magnificence I cannot endure. 

###### 24 
"If I have made gold my hope, Or said to fine gold, '_You are_ my confidence'; 

###### 25 
If I have rejoiced because my wealth _was_ great, And because my hand had gained much; 

###### 26 
If I have observed the [^f]sun when it shines, Or the moon moving _in_ brightness, 

###### 27 
So that my heart has been secretly enticed, And my mouth has kissed my hand; 

###### 28 
This also _would be_ an iniquity _deserving of_ judgment, For I would have denied God _who is_ above. 

###### 29 
"If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him who hated me, Or lifted myself up when evil found him 

###### 30 
(Indeed I have not allowed my mouth to sin By asking for a curse on his [^g]soul); 

###### 31 
If the men of my tent have not said, 'Who is there that has not been satisfied with his meat?' 

###### 32 
(_But_ no sojourner had to lodge in the street, _For_ I have opened my doors to the [^h]traveler); 

###### 33 
If I have covered my transgressions as[^i] Adam, By hiding my iniquity in my bosom, 

###### 34 
Because I feared the great multitude, And dreaded the contempt of families, So that I kept silence _And_ did not go out of the door-- 

###### 35 
Oh, that I had one to hear me! Here is my mark. _Oh,_ _that_ the Almighty would answer me, _That_ my [^j]Prosecutor had written a book! 

###### 36 
Surely I would carry it on my shoulder, _And_ bind it on me _like_ a crown; 

###### 37 
I would declare to Him the number of my steps; Like a prince I would approach Him. 

###### 38 
"If my land cries out against me, And its furrows weep together; 

###### 39 
If I have eaten its [^k]fruit without money, Or caused its owners to lose their lives; 

###### 40 
_Then_ let thistles grow instead of wheat, And weeds instead of barley." The words of Job are ended.

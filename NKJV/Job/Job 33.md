# Job 33

***


###### 1 
"But please, Job, hear my speech, And listen to all my words. 

###### 2 
Now, I open my mouth; My tongue speaks in my mouth. 

###### 3 
My words _come_ from my upright heart; My lips utter pure knowledge. 

###### 4 
The Spirit of God has made me, And the breath of the Almighty gives me life. 

###### 5 
If you can answer me, Set _your words_ in order before me; Take your stand. 

###### 6 
Truly I _am_ as your spokesman before God; I also have been formed out of clay. 

###### 7 
Surely no fear of me will terrify you, Nor will my hand be heavy on you. 

###### 8 
"Surely you have spoken in my hearing, And I have heard the sound of _your_ words, _saying,_ 

###### 9 
'I _am_ pure, without transgression; I _am_ innocent, and _there is_ no iniquity in me. 

###### 10 
Yet He finds occasions against me, He counts me as His enemy; 

###### 11 
He puts my feet in the stocks, He watches all my paths.' 

###### 12 
"Look, _in_ this you are not righteous. I will answer you, For God is greater than man. 

###### 13 
Why do you contend with Him? For He does not give an accounting of any of His words. 

###### 14 
For God may speak in one way, or in another, _Yet man_ does not perceive it. 

###### 15 
In a dream, in a vision of the night, When deep sleep falls upon men, While slumbering on their beds, 

###### 16 
Then He opens the ears of men, And seals their instruction. 

###### 17 
In order to turn man _from his_ deed, And conceal pride from man, 

###### 18 
He keeps back his soul from the Pit, And his life from perishing by the sword. 

###### 19 
"_Man_ is also chastened with pain on his bed, And with strong _pain_ in many of his bones, 

###### 20 
So that his life abhors bread, And his soul succulent food. 

###### 21 
His flesh wastes away from sight, And his bones stick out _which once_ were not seen. 

###### 22 
Yes, his soul draws near the Pit, And his life to the executioners. 

###### 23 
"If there is a messenger for him, A mediator, one among a thousand, To show man His uprightness, 

###### 24 
Then He is gracious to him, and says, 'Deliver him from going down to the Pit; I have found a ransom'; 

###### 25 
His flesh shall be young like a child's, He shall return to the days of his youth. 

###### 26 
He shall pray to God, and He will delight in him, He shall see His face with joy, For He restores to man His righteousness. 

###### 27 
Then he looks at men and says, 'I have sinned, and perverted _what was_ right, And it did not profit me.' 

###### 28 
He will redeem his soul from going down to the Pit, And his life shall see the light. 

###### 29 
"Behold, God works all these _things,_ Twice, _in fact,_ three _times_ with a man, 

###### 30 
To bring back his soul from the Pit, That he may be enlightened with the light of life. 

###### 31 
"Give ear, Job, listen to me; Hold your peace, and I will speak. 

###### 32 
If you have anything to say, answer me; Speak, for I desire to justify you. 

###### 33 
If not, listen to me; Hold your peace, and I will teach you wisdom."

# Job 34

***


###### 1 
Elihu further answered and said: 

###### 2 
"Hear my words, you wise _men;_ Give ear to me, you who have knowledge. 

###### 3 
For the ear tests words As the palate tastes food. 

###### 4 
Let us choose justice for ourselves; Let us know among ourselves what _is_ good. 

###### 5 
"For Job has said, 'I am righteous, But God has taken away my justice; 

###### 6 
Should I lie concerning my right? My [^a]wound _is_ incurable, _though I am_ without transgression.' 

###### 7 
What man _is_ like Job, _Who_ drinks [^b]scorn like water, 

###### 8 
Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity, And walks with wicked men? 

###### 9 
For he has said, 'It profits a man nothing That he should delight in God.' 

###### 10 
"Therefore listen to me, you [^c]men of understanding: Far be it from God _to do_ wickedness, And _from_ the Almighty to _commit_ iniquity. 

###### 11 
For He repays man _according to_ his work, And makes man to find a reward according to _his_ way. 

###### 12 
Surely God will never do wickedly, Nor will the Almighty pervert justice. 

###### 13 
Who gave Him charge over the earth? Or who appointed _Him over_ the whole world? 

###### 14 
If He should set His heart on it, _If_ He should gather to Himself His Spirit and His breath, 

###### 15 
All flesh would perish together, And man would return to dust. 

###### 16 
"If _you have_ understanding, hear this; Listen to the sound of my words: 

###### 17 
Should one who hates justice govern? Will you condemn _Him who is_ most just? 

###### 18 
_Is it fitting_ to say to a king, '_You are_ worthless,' _And_ to nobles, '_You are_ wicked'? 

###### 19 
Yet He is not partial to princes, Nor does He regard the rich more than the poor; For they _are_ all the work of His hands. 

###### 20 
In a moment they die, in the middle of the night; The people are shaken and pass away; The mighty are taken away without a hand. 

###### 21 
"For His eyes _are_ on the ways of man, And He sees all his steps. 

###### 22 
There is no darkness nor shadow of death Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves. 

###### 23 
For He need not further consider a man, That he should go before God in judgment. 

###### 24 
He breaks in pieces mighty men without inquiry, And sets others in their place. 

###### 25 
Therefore He knows their works; He overthrows _them_ in the night, And they are crushed. 

###### 26 
He strikes them as wicked _men_ In the open sight of others, 

###### 27 
Because they turned back from Him, And would not consider any of His ways, 

###### 28 
So that they caused the cry of the poor to come to Him; For He hears the cry of the afflicted. 

###### 29 
When He gives quietness, who then can make trouble? And when He hides _His_ face, who then can see Him, Whether _it is_ against a nation or a man alone?-- 

###### 30 
That the hypocrite should not reign, Lest the people be ensnared. 

###### 31 
"For has _anyone_ said to God, 'I have borne _chastening;_ I will offend no more; 

###### 32 
Teach me _what_ I do not see; If I have done iniquity, I will do no more'? 

###### 33 
Should He repay _it_ according to your _terms,_ _Just_ because you disavow it? You must choose, and not I; Therefore speak what you know. 

###### 34 
"Men of understanding say to me, Wise men who listen to me: 

###### 35 
'Job speaks without knowledge, His words _are_ without wisdom.' 

###### 36 
Oh, that Job were tried to the utmost, Because _his_ answers _are like_ those of wicked men! 

###### 37 
For he adds rebellion to his sin; He claps _his hands_ among us, And multiplies his words against God." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Job 35

***


###### 1 
Moreover Elihu answered and said: 

###### 2 
"Do you think this is right? Do you say, 'My righteousness is more than God's'? 

###### 3 
For you say, 'What advantage will it be to You? What profit shall I have, more than _if_ I had sinned?' 

###### 4 
"I will answer you, And your companions with you. 

###### 5 
Look to the heavens and see; And behold the clouds-- They are higher than you. 

###### 6 
If you sin, what do you accomplish against Him? Or, _if_ your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to Him? 

###### 7 
If you are righteous, what do you give Him? Or what does He receive from your hand? 

###### 8 
Your wickedness affects a man such as you, And your righteousness a son of man. 

###### 9 
"Because of the multitude of oppressions they cry out; They cry out for help because of the arm of the mighty. 

###### 10 
But no one says, 'Where _is_ God my Maker, Who gives songs in the night, 

###### 11 
Who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth, And makes us wiser than the birds of heaven?' 

###### 12 
There they cry out, but He does not answer, Because of the pride of evil men. 

###### 13 
Surely God will not listen to empty _talk,_ Nor will the Almighty regard it. 

###### 14 
Although you say you do not see Him, _Yet_ justice _is_ before Him, and you must wait for Him. 

###### 15 
And now, because He has not punished in His anger, Nor taken much notice of folly, 

###### 16 
Therefore Job opens his mouth in vain; He multiplies words without knowledge." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

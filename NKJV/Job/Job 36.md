# Job 36

***


###### 1 
Elihu also proceeded and said: 

###### 2 
"Bear with me a little, and I will show you That _there are_ yet words to speak on God's behalf. 

###### 3 
I will fetch my knowledge from afar; I will ascribe righteousness to my Maker. 

###### 4 
For truly my words _are_ not false; One who is perfect in knowledge _is_ with you. 

###### 5 
"Behold, God _is_ mighty, but despises _no one;_ _He is_ mighty in strength of understanding. 

###### 6 
He does not preserve the life of the wicked, But gives justice to the oppressed. 

###### 7 
He does not withdraw His eyes from the righteous; But _they are_ on the throne with kings, For He has seated them forever, And they are exalted. 

###### 8 
And if _they are_ bound in fetters, Held in the cords of affliction, 

###### 9 
Then He tells them their work and their transgressions-- That they have acted defiantly. 

###### 10 
He also opens their ear to instruction, And commands that they turn from iniquity. 

###### 11 
If they obey and serve _Him,_ They shall spend their days in prosperity, And their years in pleasures. 

###### 12 
But if they do not obey, They shall perish by the sword, And they shall die without knowledge. 

###### 13 
"But the hypocrites in heart store up wrath; They do not cry for help when He binds them. 

###### 14 
They die in youth, And their life _ends_ among the perverted persons. 

###### 15 
He delivers the poor in their affliction, And opens their ears in oppression. 

###### 16 
"Indeed He would have brought you out of dire distress, _Into_ a broad place where _there is_ no restraint; And what is set on your table _would be_ full of richness. 

###### 17 
But you are filled with the judgment due the wicked; Judgment and justice take hold _of you._ 

###### 18 
Because _there is_ wrath, _beware_ lest He take you away with _one_ blow; For a large ransom would not help you avoid _it._ 

###### 19 
Will your riches, Or all the mighty forces, Keep you from distress? 

###### 20 
Do not desire the night, When people are cut off in their place. 

###### 21 
Take heed, do not turn to iniquity, For you have chosen this rather than affliction. 

###### 22 
"Behold, God is exalted by His power; Who teaches like Him? 

###### 23 
Who has assigned Him His way, Or who has said, 'You have done wrong'? ## Elihu Proclaims God's Majesty 

###### 24 
"Remember to magnify His work, Of which men have sung. 

###### 25 
Everyone has seen it; Man looks on _it_ from afar. 

###### 26 
"Behold, God _is_ great, and we do not know _Him;_ Nor can the number of His years _be_ discovered. 

###### 27 
For He draws up drops of water, Which distill as rain from the mist, 

###### 28 
Which the clouds drop down _And_ pour abundantly on man. 

###### 29 
Indeed, can _anyone_ understand the spreading of clouds, The thunder from His canopy? 

###### 30 
Look, He scatters His light upon it, And covers the depths of the sea. 

###### 31 
For by these He judges the peoples; He gives food in abundance. 

###### 32 
He covers _His_ hands with lightning, And commands it to strike. 

###### 33 
His thunder declares it, The cattle also, concerning the rising _storm._

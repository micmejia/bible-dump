# Job 37

***


###### 1 
"At this also my heart trembles, And leaps from its place. 

###### 2 
Hear attentively the thunder of His voice, And the rumbling _that_ comes from His mouth. 

###### 3 
He sends it forth under the whole heaven, His [^a]lightning to the ends of the earth. 

###### 4 
After it a voice roars; He thunders with His majestic voice, And He does not restrain them when His voice is heard. 

###### 5 
God thunders marvelously with His voice; He does great things which we cannot comprehend. 

###### 6 
For He says to the snow, 'Fall _on_ the earth'; Likewise to the [^b]gentle rain and the heavy rain of His strength. 

###### 7 
He seals the hand of every man, That all men may know His work. 

###### 8 
The beasts go into dens, And remain in their lairs. 

###### 9 
From the chamber _of the south_ comes the whirlwind, And cold from the scattering winds _of the north._ 

###### 10 
By the breath of God ice is given, And the broad waters are frozen. 

###### 11 
Also with moisture He saturates the thick clouds; He scatters His [^c]bright clouds. 

###### 12 
And they swirl about, being turned by His guidance, That they may do whatever He commands them On the face of [^d]the whole earth. 

###### 13 
He causes it to come, Whether for [^e]correction, Or for His land, Or for mercy. 

###### 14 
"Listen to this, O Job; Stand still and consider the wondrous works of God. 

###### 15 
Do you know when God [^f]dispatches them, And causes the light of His cloud to shine? 

###### 16 
Do you know how the clouds are balanced, Those wondrous works of Him who is perfect in knowledge? 

###### 17 
Why _are_ your garments hot, When He quiets the earth by the south _wind?_ 

###### 18 
With Him, have you spread out the skies, Strong as a cast metal mirror? 

###### 19 
"Teach us what we should say to Him, _For_ we can prepare nothing because of the darkness. 

###### 20 
Should He be told that I _wish to_ speak? If a man were to speak, surely he would be swallowed up. 

###### 21 
Even now _men_ cannot look at the light _when it is_ bright in the skies, When the wind has passed and cleared them. 

###### 22 
He comes from the north _as_ golden _splendor;_ With God _is_ awesome majesty. 

###### 23 
_As for_ the Almighty, we cannot find Him; _He is_ excellent in power, _In_ judgment and abundant justice; He does not oppress. 

###### 24 
Therefore men fear Him; He shows no partiality to any _who are_ wise of heart."

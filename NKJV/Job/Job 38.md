# Job 38

***


###### 1 
Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said: 

###### 2 
"Who _is_ this who darkens counsel By words without knowledge? 

###### 3 
Now [^a]prepare yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall answer Me. 

###### 4 
"Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? Tell _Me,_ if you have understanding. 

###### 5 
Who determined its measurements? Surely you know! Or who stretched the [^b]line upon it? 

###### 6 
To what were its foundations fastened? Or who laid its cornerstone, 

###### 7 
When the morning stars sang together, And all the sons of God shouted for joy? 

###### 8 
"Or _who_ shut in the sea with doors, When it burst forth _and_ issued from the womb; 

###### 9 
When I made the clouds its garment, And thick darkness its swaddling band; 

###### 10 
When I fixed My limit for it, And set bars and doors; 

###### 11 
When I said, 'This far you may come, but no farther, And here your proud waves must stop!' 

###### 12 
"Have you commanded the morning since your days _began,_ _And_ caused the dawn to know its place, 

###### 13 
That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, And the wicked be shaken out of it? 

###### 14 
It takes on form like clay _under_ a seal, And stands out like a garment. 

###### 15 
From the wicked their light is withheld, And the [^c]upraised arm is broken. 

###### 16 
"Have you entered the springs of the sea? Or have you walked in search of the depths? 

###### 17 
Have the gates of death been [^d]revealed to you? Or have you seen the doors of the shadow of death? 

###### 18 
Have you comprehended the breadth of the earth? Tell _Me,_ if you know all this. 

###### 19 
"Where _is_ the way _to_ the dwelling of light? And darkness, where _is_ its place, 

###### 20 
That you may take it to its territory, That you may know the paths _to_ its home? 

###### 21 
Do you know _it,_ because you were born then, Or _because_ the number of your days _is_ great? 

###### 22 
"Have you entered the treasury of snow, Or have you seen the treasury of hail, 

###### 23 
Which I have reserved for the time of trouble, For the day of battle and war? 

###### 24 
By what way is light [^e]diffused, _Or_ the east wind scattered over the earth? 

###### 25 
"Who has divided a channel for the overflowing _water,_ Or a path for the thunderbolt, 

###### 26 
To cause it to rain on a land _where there is_ no one, A wilderness in which _there is_ no man; 

###### 27 
To satisfy the desolate waste, And cause to spring forth the growth of tender grass? 

###### 28 
Has the rain a father? Or who has begotten the drops of dew? 

###### 29 
From whose womb comes the ice? And the frost of heaven, who gives it birth? 

###### 30 
The waters harden like stone, And the surface of the deep is frozen.[^f] 

###### 31 
"Can you bind the cluster of the Pleiades,[^g] Or loose the belt of Orion? 

###### 32 
Can you bring out [^h]Mazzaroth in its season? Or can you guide [^i]the Great Bear with its cubs? 

###### 33 
Do you know the ordinances of the heavens? Can you set their dominion over the earth? 

###### 34 
"Can you lift up your voice to the clouds, That an abundance of water may cover you? 

###### 35 
Can you send out lightnings, that they may go, And say to you, 'Here we _are!_'? 

###### 36 
Who has put wisdom in [^j]the mind? Or who has given understanding to the heart? 

###### 37 
Who can number the clouds by wisdom? Or who can pour out the bottles of heaven, 

###### 38 
When the dust hardens in clumps, And the clods cling together? 

###### 39 
"Can you hunt the prey for the lion, Or satisfy the appetite of the young lions, 

###### 40 
When they crouch in _their_ dens, _Or_ lurk in their lairs to lie in wait? 

###### 41 
Who provides food for the raven, When its young ones cry to God, And wander about for lack of food?

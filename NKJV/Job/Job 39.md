# Job 39

***


###### 1 
"Do you know the time when the wild mountain goats bear young? _Or_ can you mark when the deer gives birth? 

###### 2 
Can you number the months _that_ they fulfill? Or do you know the time when they bear young? 

###### 3 
They bow down, They bring forth their young, They deliver their [^a]offspring. 

###### 4 
Their young ones are healthy, They grow strong with grain; They depart and do not return to them. 

###### 5 
"Who set the wild donkey free? Who loosed the bonds of the [^b]onager, 

###### 6 
Whose home I have made the wilderness, And the [^c]barren land his dwelling? 

###### 7 
He scorns the tumult of the city; He does not heed the shouts of the driver. 

###### 8 
The range of the mountains _is_ his pasture, And he searches after every green thing. 

###### 9 
"Will the wild ox be willing to serve you? Will he bed by your manger? 

###### 10 
Can you bind the wild ox in the furrow with ropes? Or will he plow the valleys behind you? 

###### 11 
Will you trust him because his strength _is_ great? Or will you leave your labor to him? 

###### 12 
Will you trust him to bring home your [^d]grain, And gather it to your threshing floor? 

###### 13 
"The wings of the ostrich wave proudly, But are her wings and pinions _like the_ kindly stork's? 

###### 14 
For she leaves her eggs on the ground, And warms them in the dust; 

###### 15 
She forgets that a foot may crush them, Or that a wild beast may break them. 

###### 16 
She treats her young harshly, as though _they were_ not hers; Her labor is in vain, without [^e]concern, 

###### 17 
Because God deprived her of wisdom, And did not endow her with understanding. 

###### 18 
When she lifts herself on high, She scorns the horse and its rider. 

###### 19 
"Have you given the horse strength? Have you clothed his neck with [^f]thunder? 

###### 20 
Can you [^g]frighten him like a locust? His majestic snorting strikes terror. 

###### 21 
He paws in the valley, and rejoices in _his_ strength; He gallops into the clash of arms. 

###### 22 
He mocks at fear, and is not frightened; Nor does he turn back from the sword. 

###### 23 
The quiver rattles against him, The glittering spear and javelin. 

###### 24 
He devours the distance with fierceness and rage; Nor does he come to a halt because the trumpet _has_ sounded. 

###### 25 
At _the blast of_ the trumpet he says, 'Aha!' He smells the battle from afar, The thunder of captains and shouting. 

###### 26 
"Does the hawk fly by your wisdom, _And_ spread its wings toward the south? 

###### 27 
Does the eagle mount up at your command, And make its nest on high? 

###### 28 
On the rock it dwells and resides, On the crag of the rock and the stronghold. 

###### 29 
From there it spies out the prey; Its eyes observe from afar. 

###### 30 
Its young ones suck up blood; And where the slain _are,_ there it _is._" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

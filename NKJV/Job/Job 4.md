# Job 4

***


###### 1 
Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said: 

###### 2 
"_If_ one attempts a word with you, will you become weary? But who can withhold himself from speaking? 

###### 3 
Surely you have instructed many, And you have strengthened weak hands. 

###### 4 
Your words have upheld him who was stumbling, And you have strengthened the [^a]feeble knees; 

###### 5 
But now it comes upon you, and you are weary; It touches you, and you are troubled. 

###### 6 
_Is_ not your reverence your confidence? And the integrity of your ways your hope? 

###### 7 
"Remember now, who _ever_ perished being innocent? Or where were the upright _ever_ cut off? 

###### 8 
Even as I have seen, Those who plow iniquity And sow trouble reap the same. 

###### 9 
By the blast of God they perish, And by the breath of His anger they are consumed. 

###### 10 
The roaring of the lion, The voice of the fierce lion, And the teeth of the young lions are broken. 

###### 11 
The old lion perishes for lack of prey, And the cubs of the lioness are scattered. 

###### 12 
"Now a word was secretly brought to me, And my ear received a whisper of it. 

###### 13 
In disquieting thoughts from the visions of the night, When deep sleep falls on men, 

###### 14 
Fear came upon me, and trembling, Which made all my bones shake. 

###### 15 
Then a spirit passed before my face; The hair on my body stood up. 

###### 16 
It stood still, But I could not discern its appearance. A form _was_ before my eyes; _There was_ silence; Then I heard a voice _saying:_ 

###### 17 
'Can a mortal be more righteous than God? Can a man be more pure than his Maker? 

###### 18 
If He puts no trust in His servants, _If_ He charges His angels with error, 

###### 19 
How much more those who dwell in houses of clay, Whose foundation is in the dust, _Who_ are crushed before a moth? 

###### 20 
They are broken in pieces from morning till evening; They perish forever, with no one regarding. 

###### 21 
Does not their own excellence go away? They die, even without wisdom.' ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

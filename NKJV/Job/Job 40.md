# Job 40

***


###### 1 
Moreover the Lord answered Job, and said: 

###### 2 
"Shall the one who contends with the Almighty correct _Him?_ He who rebukes God, let him answer it." ## Job's Response to God 

###### 3 
Then Job answered the Lord and said: 

###### 4 
"Behold, I am vile; What shall I answer You? I lay my hand over my mouth. 

###### 5 
Once I have spoken, but I will not answer; Yes, twice, but I will proceed no further." ## God's Challenge to Job 

###### 6 
Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said: 

###### 7 
"Now prepare yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall answer Me: 

###### 8 
"Would you indeed annul My judgment? Would you condemn Me that you may be justified? 

###### 9 
Have you an arm like God? Or can you thunder with a voice like His? 

###### 10 
Then adorn yourself _with_ majesty and splendor, And array yourself with glory and beauty. 

###### 11 
Disperse the rage of your wrath; Look on everyone _who is_ proud, and humble him. 

###### 12 
Look on everyone _who is_ proud, _and_ bring him low; Tread down the wicked in their place. 

###### 13 
Hide them in the dust together, Bind their faces in hidden _darkness._ 

###### 14 
Then I will also confess to you That your own right hand can save you. 

###### 15 
"Look now at the behemoth, which I made _along_ with you; He eats grass like an ox. 

###### 16 
See now, his strength _is_ in his hips, And his power _is_ in his stomach muscles. 

###### 17 
He moves his tail like a cedar; The sinews of his thighs are tightly knit. 

###### 18 
His bones _are like_ beams of bronze, His ribs like bars of iron. 

###### 19 
He _is_ the first of the ways of God; Only He who made him can bring near His sword. 

###### 20 
Surely the mountains yield food for him, And all the beasts of the field play there. 

###### 21 
He lies under the lotus trees, In a covert of reeds and marsh. 

###### 22 
The lotus trees cover him _with_ their shade; The willows by the brook surround him. 

###### 23 
Indeed the river may rage, _Yet_ he is not disturbed; He is confident, though the Jordan gushes into his mouth, 

###### 24 
_Though_ he takes it in his eyes, _Or_ one pierces _his_ nose with a snare.

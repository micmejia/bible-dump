# Job 41

***


###### 1 
"Can you draw out Leviathan[^a] with a hook, Or _snare_ his tongue with a line _which_ you lower? 

###### 2 
Can you put a reed through his nose, Or pierce his jaw with a [^b]hook? 

###### 3 
Will he make many supplications to you? Will he speak softly to you? 

###### 4 
Will he make a covenant with you? Will you take him as a servant forever? 

###### 5 
Will you play with him as _with_ a bird, Or will you leash him for your maidens? 

###### 6 
Will _your_ companions [^c]make a banquet of him? Will they apportion him among the merchants? 

###### 7 
Can you fill his skin with harpoons, Or his head with fishing spears? 

###### 8 
Lay your hand on him; Remember the battle-- Never do it again! 

###### 9 
Indeed, _any_ hope of _overcoming_ him is false; Shall _one not_ be overwhelmed at the sight of him? 

###### 10 
No one _is so_ fierce that he would dare stir him up. Who then is able to stand against Me? 

###### 11 
Who has preceded Me, that I should pay _him?_ Everything under heaven is Mine. 

###### 12 
"I will not [^d]conceal his limbs, His mighty power, or his graceful proportions. 

###### 13 
Who can [^e]remove his outer coat? Who can approach _him_ with a double bridle? 

###### 14 
Who can open the doors of his face, _With_ his terrible teeth all around? 

###### 15 
_His_ rows of [^f]scales are _his_ pride, Shut up tightly _as with_ a seal; 

###### 16 
One is so near another That no air can come between them; 

###### 17 
They are joined one to another, They stick together and cannot be parted. 

###### 18 
His sneezings flash forth light, And his eyes _are_ like the eyelids of the morning. 

###### 19 
Out of his mouth go burning lights; Sparks of fire shoot out. 

###### 20 
Smoke goes out of his nostrils, As _from_ a boiling pot and burning rushes. 

###### 21 
His breath kindles coals, And a flame goes out of his mouth. 

###### 22 
Strength dwells in his neck, And [^g]sorrow dances before him. 

###### 23 
The folds of his flesh are joined together; They are firm on him and cannot be moved. 

###### 24 
His heart is as hard as stone, Even as hard as the lower _millstone._ 

###### 25 
When he raises himself up, the mighty are afraid; Because of his crashings they [^h]are beside themselves. 

###### 26 
_Though_ the sword reaches him, it cannot avail; Nor does spear, dart, or javelin. 

###### 27 
He regards iron as straw, _And_ bronze as rotten wood. 

###### 28 
The arrow cannot make him flee; Slingstones become like stubble to him. 

###### 29 
Darts are regarded as straw; He laughs at the threat of javelins. 

###### 30 
His undersides _are_ like sharp potsherds; He spreads pointed _marks_ in the mire. 

###### 31 
He makes the deep boil like a pot; He makes the sea like a pot of ointment. 

###### 32 
He leaves a shining wake behind him; _One_ would think the deep had white hair. 

###### 33 
On earth there is nothing like him, Which is made without fear. 

###### 34 
He beholds every high _thing;_ He _is_ king over all the children of pride."

# Job 5

***


###### 1 
"Call out now; Is there anyone who will answer you? And to which of the holy ones will you turn? 

###### 2 
For wrath kills a foolish man, And envy slays a simple one. 

###### 3 
I have seen the foolish taking root, But suddenly I cursed his dwelling place. 

###### 4 
His sons are far from safety, They are crushed in the gate, And _there is_ no deliverer. 

###### 5 
Because the hungry eat up his harvest, [^a]Taking it even from the thorns, [^b]And a snare snatches their [^c]substance. 

###### 6 
For affliction does not come from the dust, Nor does trouble spring from the ground; 

###### 7 
Yet man is born to [^d]trouble, As the sparks fly upward. 

###### 8 
"But as for me, I would seek God, And to God I would commit my cause-- 

###### 9 
Who does great things, and unsearchable, Marvelous things without number. 

###### 10 
He gives rain on the earth, And sends waters on the fields. 

###### 11 
He sets on high those who are lowly, And those who mourn are lifted to safety. 

###### 12 
He frustrates the devices of the crafty, So that their hands cannot carry out their plans. 

###### 13 
He catches the wise in their own craftiness, And the counsel of the cunning comes quickly upon them. 

###### 14 
They meet with darkness in the daytime, And grope at noontime as in the night. 

###### 15 
But He saves the needy from the sword, From the mouth of the mighty, And from their hand. 

###### 16 
So the poor have hope, And injustice shuts her mouth. 

###### 17 
"Behold, happy _is_ the man whom God corrects; Therefore do not despise the chastening of the Almighty. 

###### 18 
For He bruises, but He binds up; He wounds, but His hands make whole. 

###### 19 
He shall deliver you in six troubles, Yes, in seven no evil shall touch you. 

###### 20 
In famine He shall redeem you from death, And in war from the [^e]power of the sword. 

###### 21 
You shall be hidden from the scourge of the tongue, And you shall not be afraid of destruction when it comes. 

###### 22 
You shall laugh at destruction and famine, And you shall not be afraid of the beasts of the earth. 

###### 23 
For you shall have a covenant with the stones of the field, And the beasts of the field shall be at peace with you. 

###### 24 
You shall know that your tent _is_ in peace; You shall visit your dwelling and find nothing amiss. 

###### 25 
You shall also know that your descendants _shall be_ many, And your offspring like the grass of the earth. 

###### 26 
You shall come to the grave at a full age, As a sheaf of grain ripens in its season. 

###### 27 
Behold, this we have searched out; It _is_ true. Hear it, and know for yourself." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

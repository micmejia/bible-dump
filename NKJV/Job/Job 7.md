# Job 7

***


###### 1 
"_Is there_ not a time of hard service for man on earth? _Are not_ his days also like the days of a hired man? 

###### 2 
Like a servant who [^a]earnestly desires the shade, And like a hired man who eagerly looks for his wages, 

###### 3 
So I have been allotted months of futility, And wearisome nights have been appointed to me. 

###### 4 
When I lie down, I say, 'When shall I arise, And the night be ended?' For I have had my fill of tossing till dawn. 

###### 5 
My flesh is caked with worms and dust, My skin is cracked and breaks out afresh. 

###### 6 
"My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, And are spent without hope. 

###### 7 
Oh, remember that my life _is_ a breath! My eye will never again see good. 

###### 8 
The eye of him who sees me will see me no _more;_ _While_ your eyes _are_ upon me, I shall no longer _be._ 

###### 9 
_As_ the cloud disappears and vanishes away, So he who goes down to the grave does not come up. 

###### 10 
He shall never return to his house, Nor shall his place know him anymore. 

###### 11 
"Therefore I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul. 

###### 12 
_Am_ I a sea, or a sea serpent, That You set a guard over me? 

###### 13 
When I say, 'My bed will comfort me, My couch will ease my complaint,' 

###### 14 
Then You scare me with dreams And terrify me with visions, 

###### 15 
So that my soul chooses strangling _And_ death rather than [^b]my body. 

###### 16 
I loathe _my life;_ I would not live forever. Let me alone, For my days _are but_ [^c]a breath. 

###### 17 
"What _is_ man, that You should exalt him, _That_ You should set Your heart on him, 

###### 18 
That You should [^d]visit him every morning, _And_ test him every moment? 

###### 19 
How long? Will You not look away from me, And let me alone till I swallow my saliva? 

###### 20 
Have I sinned? What have I done to You, O watcher of men? Why have You set me as Your target, So that I am a burden [^e]to myself? 

###### 21 
Why then do You not pardon my transgression, And take away my iniquity? For now I will lie down in the dust, And You will seek me diligently, But I _will_ no longer _be._"

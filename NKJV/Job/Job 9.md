# Job 9

***


###### 1 
Then Job answered and said: 

###### 2 
"Truly I know _it is_ so, But how can a man be righteous before God? 

###### 3 
If one wished to [^a]contend with Him, He could not answer Him one time out of a thousand. 

###### 4 
_God is_ wise in heart and mighty in strength. Who has hardened _himself_ against Him and prospered? 

###### 5 
He removes the mountains, and they do not know When He overturns them in His anger; 

###### 6 
He shakes the earth out of its place, And its pillars tremble; 

###### 7 
He commands the sun, and it does not rise; He seals off the stars; 

###### 8 
He alone spreads out the heavens, And [^b]treads on the [^c]waves of the sea; 

###### 9 
He made [^d]the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, And the chambers of the south; 

###### 10 
He does great things past finding out, Yes, wonders without number. 

###### 11 
If He goes by me, I do not see _Him;_ If He moves past, I do not perceive Him; 

###### 12 
If He takes away, [^e]who can hinder Him? Who can say to Him, 'What are You doing?' 

###### 13 
God will not withdraw His anger, The allies of [^f]the proud lie prostrate beneath Him. 

###### 14 
"How then can I answer Him, _And_ choose my words _to reason_ with Him? 

###### 15 
For though I were righteous, I could not answer Him; I would beg mercy of my Judge. 

###### 16 
If I called and He answered me, I would not believe that He was listening to my voice. 

###### 17 
For He crushes me with a tempest, And multiplies my wounds without cause. 

###### 18 
He will not allow me to catch my breath, But fills me with bitterness. 

###### 19 
If _it is a matter_ of strength, indeed _He is_ strong; And if of justice, who will appoint my day _in court?_ 

###### 20 
Though I were righteous, my own mouth would condemn me; Though I _were_ blameless, it would prove me perverse. 

###### 21 
"I am blameless, yet I do not know myself; I despise my life. 

###### 22 
It _is_ all one _thing;_ Therefore I say, 'He destroys the blameless and the wicked.' 

###### 23 
If the scourge slays suddenly, He laughs at the plight of the innocent. 

###### 24 
The earth is given into the hand of the wicked. He covers the faces of its judges. If it is not _He,_ who else could it be? 

###### 25 
"Now my days are swifter than a runner; They flee away, they see no good. 

###### 26 
They pass by like [^g]swift ships, Like an eagle swooping on its prey. 

###### 27 
If I say, 'I will forget my complaint, I will put off my sad face and wear a smile,' 

###### 28 
I am afraid of all my sufferings; I know that You will not hold me innocent. 

###### 29 
_If_ I am condemned, Why then do I labor in vain? 

###### 30 
If I wash myself with snow water, And cleanse my hands with [^h]soap, 

###### 31 
Yet You will plunge me into the pit, And my own clothes will [^i]abhor me. 

###### 32 
"For _He is_ not a man, as I _am,_ _That_ I may answer Him, _And that_ we should go to court together. 

###### 33 
Nor is there any mediator between us, _Who_ may lay his hand on us both. 

###### 34 
Let Him take His rod away from me, And do not let dread of Him terrify me. 

###### 35 
_Then_ I would speak and not fear Him, But it is not so with me. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

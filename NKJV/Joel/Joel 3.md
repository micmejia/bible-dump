# Joel 3

***


###### 1 
"For behold, in those days and at that time, When I bring back the captives of Judah and Jerusalem, 

###### 2 
I will also gather all nations, And bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat; And I will enter into judgment with them there On account of My people, My heritage Israel, Whom they have scattered among the nations; They have also divided up My land. 

###### 3 
They have cast lots for My people, Have given a boy _as payment_ for a harlot, And sold a girl for wine, that they may drink. 

###### 4 
"Indeed, what have you to do with Me, O Tyre and Sidon, and all the coasts of Philistia? Will you [^a]retaliate against Me? But if you [^b]retaliate against Me, Swiftly and speedily I will return your [^c]retaliation upon your own head; 

###### 5 
Because you have taken My silver and My gold, And have carried into your temples My [^d]prized possessions. 

###### 6 
Also the people of Judah and the people of Jerusalem You have sold to the Greeks, That you may remove them far from their borders. 

###### 7 
"Behold, I will raise them Out of the place to which you have sold them, And will return your [^e]retaliation upon your own head. 

###### 8 
I will sell your sons and your daughters Into the hand of the people of Judah, And they will sell them to the Sabeans,[^f] To a people far off; For the Lord has spoken." 

###### 9 
Proclaim this among the nations: "Prepare for war! Wake up the mighty men, Let all the men of war draw near, Let them come up. 

###### 10 
Beat your plowshares into swords And your [^g]pruning hooks into spears; Let the weak say, 'I _am_ strong.' " 

###### 11 
Assemble and come, all you nations, And gather together all around. Cause Your mighty ones to go down there, O Lord. 

###### 12 
"Let the nations be wakened, and come up to the Valley of Jehoshaphat; For there I will sit to judge all the surrounding nations. 

###### 13 
Put in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe. Come, go down; For the winepress is full, The vats overflow-- For their wickedness _is_ great." 

###### 14 
Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For the day of the Lord _is_ near in the valley of decision. 

###### 15 
The sun and moon will grow dark, And the stars will diminish their brightness. 

###### 16 
The Lord also will roar from Zion, And utter His voice from Jerusalem; The heavens and earth will shake; But the Lord will be a shelter for His people, And the strength of the children of Israel. 

###### 17 
"So you shall know that I _am_ the Lord your God, Dwelling in Zion My holy mountain. Then Jerusalem shall be holy, And no aliens shall ever pass through her again." ## God Blesses His People 

###### 18 
And it will come to pass in that day _That_ the mountains shall drip with new wine, The hills shall flow with milk, And all the brooks of Judah shall be flooded with water; A fountain shall flow from the house of the Lord And water the Valley of [^h]Acacias. 

###### 19 
"Egypt shall be a desolation, And Edom a desolate wilderness, Because of violence _against_ the people of Judah, For they have shed innocent blood in their land. 

###### 20 
But Judah shall abide forever, And Jerusalem from generation to generation. 

###### 21 
For I will acquit them of the guilt of bloodshed, whom I had not acquitted; For the Lord dwells in Zion." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

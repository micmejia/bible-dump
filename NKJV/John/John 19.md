# John 19

***


###### 1 
So then Pilate took Jesus and scourged _Him._ 

###### 2 
And the soldiers twisted a crown of thorns and put _it_ on His head, and they put on Him a purple robe. 

###### 3 
Then they said, "Hail, King of the Jews!" And they struck Him with their hands. 

###### 4 
Pilate then went out again, and said to them, "Behold, I am bringing Him out to you, that you may know that I find no fault in Him." ## Pilate's Decision 

###### 5 
Then Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And _Pilate_ said to them, "Behold the Man!" 

###### 6 
Therefore, when the chief priests and officers saw Him, they cried out, saying, "Crucify _Him,_ crucify _Him!_" Pilate said to them, "You take Him and crucify _Him,_ for I find no fault in Him." 

###### 7 
The Jews answered him, "We have a law, and according to our law He ought to die, because He made Himself the Son of God." 

###### 8 
Therefore, when Pilate heard that saying, he was the more afraid, 

###### 9 
and went again into the Praetorium, and said to Jesus, "Where are You from?" But Jesus gave him no answer. 

###### 10 
Then Pilate said to Him, "Are You not speaking to me? Do You not know that I have power to crucify You, and power to release You?" 

###### 11 
Jesus answered, "You could have no power at all against Me unless it had been given you from above. Therefore the one who delivered Me to you has the greater sin." 

###### 12 
From then on Pilate sought to release Him, but the Jews cried out, saying, "If you let this Man go, you are not Caesar's friend. Whoever makes himself a king speaks against Caesar." 

###### 13 
When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus out and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called _The_ Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha. 

###### 14 
Now it was the Preparation Day of the Passover, and about the sixth hour. And he said to the Jews, "Behold your King!" 

###### 15 
But they cried out, "Away with _Him,_ away with _Him!_ Crucify Him!" Pilate said to them, "Shall I crucify your King?" The chief priests answered, "We have no king but Caesar!" 

###### 16 
Then he delivered Him to them to be crucified. Then they took Jesus and led _Him_ away.

## The King on a Cross 

###### 17 
And He, bearing His cross, went out to a place called _the Place_ of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha, 

###### 18 
where they crucified Him, and two others with Him, one on either side, and Jesus in the center. 

###### 19 
Now Pilate wrote a title and put _it_ on the cross. And the writing was: JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS. 

###### 20 
Then many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, _and_ Latin. 

###### 21 
Therefore the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, "Do not write, 'The King of the Jews,' but, 'He said, "I am the King of the Jews." ' " 

###### 22 
Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written." 

###### 23 
Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took His garments and made four parts, to each soldier a part, and also the tunic. Now the tunic was without seam, woven from the top in one piece. 

###### 24 
They said therefore among themselves, "Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be," that the Scripture might be fulfilled which says: "They divided My garments among them, And for My clothing they cast lots." Therefore the soldiers did these things.

## Behold Your Mother 

###### 25 
Now there stood by the cross of Jesus His mother, and His mother's sister, Mary the _wife_ of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. 

###### 26 
When Jesus therefore saw His mother, and the disciple whom He loved standing by, He said to His mother, "Woman, behold your son!" 

###### 27 
Then He said to the disciple, "Behold your mother!" And from that hour that disciple took her to his own _home._

## It Is Finished 

###### 28 
After this, Jesus, knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, "I thirst!" 

###### 29 
Now a vessel full of sour wine was sitting there; and they filled a sponge with sour wine, put _it_ on hyssop, and put _it_ to His mouth. 

###### 30 
So when Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, "It is finished!" And bowing His head, He gave up His spirit.

## Jesus' Side Is Pierced 

###### 31 
Therefore, because it was the Preparation _Day,_ that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and _that_ they might be taken away. 

###### 32 
Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and of the other who was crucified with Him. 

###### 33 
But when they came to Jesus and saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs. 

###### 34 
But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out. 

###### 35 
And he who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true; and he knows that he is telling the truth, so that you may believe. 

###### 36 
For these things were done that the Scripture should be fulfilled, "Not _one_ of His bones shall be broken." 

###### 37 
And again another Scripture says, "They shall look on Him whom they pierced." ## Jesus Buried in Joseph's Tomb 

###### 38 
After this, Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly, for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave _him_ permission. So he came and took the body of Jesus. 

###### 39 
And Nicodemus, who at first came to Jesus by night, also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds. 

###### 40 
Then they took the body of Jesus, and bound it in strips of linen with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury. 

###### 41 
Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid. 

###### 42 
So there they laid Jesus, because of the Jews' Preparation _Day,_ for the tomb was nearby.

# Jonah 2

***


###### 1 
Then Jonah prayed to the Lord his God from the fish's belly. 

###### 2 
And he said: "I cried out to the Lord because of my affliction, And He answered me. "Out of the belly of Sheol I cried, _And_ You heard my voice. 

###### 3 
For You cast me into the deep, Into the heart of the seas, And the floods surrounded me; All Your billows and Your waves passed over me. 

###### 4 
Then I said, 'I have been cast out of Your sight; Yet I will look again toward Your holy temple.' 

###### 5 
The waters surrounded me, _even_ to my soul; The deep closed around me; Weeds were wrapped around my head. 

###### 6 
I went down to the moorings of the mountains; The earth with its bars _closed_ behind me forever; Yet You have brought up my life from the pit, O Lord, my God. 

###### 7 
"When my soul fainted within me, I remembered the Lord; And my prayer went _up_ to You, Into Your holy temple. 

###### 8 
"Those who regard worthless idols Forsake their own Mercy. 

###### 9 
But I will sacrifice to You With the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay what I have vowed. Salvation _is_ of the Lord." 

###### 10 
So the Lord spoke to the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry _land._

# Jonah 4

***


###### 1 
But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he became angry. 

###### 2 
So he prayed to the Lord, and said, "Ah, Lord, was not this what I said when I was still in my country? Therefore I fled previously to Tarshish; for I know that You _are_ a gracious and merciful God, slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness, One who relents from doing harm. 

###### 3 
Therefore now, O Lord, please take my life from me, for _it is_ better for me to die than to live!" 

###### 4 
Then the Lord said, "_Is it_ right for you to be angry?" 

###### 5 
So Jonah went out of the city and sat on the east side of the city. There he made himself a shelter and sat under it in the shade, till he might see what would become of the city. 

###### 6 
And the Lord God prepared a [^a]plant and made it come up over Jonah, that it might be shade for his head to deliver him from his misery. So Jonah [^b]was very grateful for the plant. 

###### 7 
But as morning dawned the next day God prepared a worm, and it _so_ damaged the plant that it withered. 

###### 8 
And it happened, when the sun arose, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat on Jonah's head, so that he grew faint. Then he wished death for himself, and said, "_It is_ better for me to die than to live." 

###### 9 
Then God said to Jonah, "_Is it_ right for you to be angry about the plant?" And he said, "_It is_ right for me to be angry, even to death!" 

###### 10 
But the Lord said, "You have had pity on the plant for which you have not labored, nor made it grow, which [^c]came up in a night and perished in a night. 

###### 11 
And should I not pity Nineveh, that great city, in which are more than one hundred and twenty thousand persons who cannot discern between their right hand and their left--and much livestock?"

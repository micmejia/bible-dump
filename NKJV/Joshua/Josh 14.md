# Joshua 14

***


###### 1 
These _are the areas_ which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel distributed as an inheritance to them. 

###### 2 
Their inheritance _was_ by lot, as the Lord had commanded by the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes and the half-tribe. 

###### 3 
For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe on the other side of the Jordan; but to the Levites he had given no inheritance among them. 

###### 4 
For the children of Joseph were two tribes: Manasseh and Ephraim. And they gave no part to the Levites in the land, except cities to dwell _in,_ with their common-lands for their livestock and their property. 

###### 5 
As the Lord had commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did; and they divided the land. ## Caleb Inherits Hebron 

###### 6 
Then the children of Judah came to Joshua in Gilgal. And Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him: "You know the word which the Lord said to Moses the man of God concerning you and me in Kadesh Barnea. 

###### 7 
I _was_ forty years old when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh Barnea to spy out the land, and I brought back word to him as _it was_ in my heart. 

###### 8 
Nevertheless my brethren who went up with me made the heart of the people melt, but I wholly followed the Lord my God. 

###### 9 
So Moses swore on that day, saying, 'Surely the land where your foot has trodden shall be your inheritance and your children's forever, because you have wholly followed the Lord my God.' 

###### 10 
And now, behold, the Lord has kept me alive, as He said, these forty-five years, ever since the Lord spoke this word to Moses while Israel wandered in the wilderness; and now, here I am this day, eighty-five years old. 

###### 11 
As yet I _am as_ strong this day as on the day that Moses sent me; just as my strength _was_ then, so now _is_ my strength for war, both for going out and for coming in. 

###### 12 
Now therefore, give me this mountain of which the Lord spoke in that day; for you heard in that day how the Anakim _were_ there, and _that_ the cities _were_ great _and_ fortified. It may be that the Lord _will be_ with me, and I shall be able to drive them out as the Lord said." 

###### 13 
And Joshua blessed him, and gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh as an inheritance. 

###### 14 
Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day, because he wholly followed the Lord God of Israel. 

###### 15 
And the name of Hebron formerly was Kirjath Arba (_Arba was_ the greatest man among the Anakim). Then the land had rest from war.

# Joshua 16

***


###### 1 
The lot [^a]fell to the children of Joseph from the Jordan, by Jericho, to the waters of Jericho on the east, to the wilderness that goes up from Jericho through the mountains to [^b]Bethel, 

###### 2 
then went out [^c]from Bethel to Luz, passed along to the border of the Archites at Ataroth, 

###### 3 
and went down westward to the boundary of the Japhletites, as far as the boundary of Lower Beth Horon to Gezer; and [^d]it ended at the sea. 

###### 4 
So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their [^e]inheritance. ## The Land of Ephraim 

###### 5 
The border of the children of Ephraim, according to their families, was _thus:_ The border of their inheritance on the east side was Ataroth Addar as far as Upper Beth Horon. 

###### 6 
And the border went out toward the sea on the north side of Michmethath; then the border went around eastward to Taanath Shiloh, and passed by it on the east of Janohah. 

###### 7 
Then it went down from Janohah to Ataroth and [^f]Naarah, reached to Jericho, and came out at the Jordan. 

###### 8 
The border went out from Tappuah westward to the Brook Kanah, and [^g]it ended at the sea. This _was_ the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim according to their families. 

###### 9 
The separate cities for the children of Ephraim _were_ among the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages. 

###### 10 
And they did not drive out the Canaanites who dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites to this day and have become forced laborers.

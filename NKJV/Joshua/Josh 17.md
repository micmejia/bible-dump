# Joshua 17

***


###### 1 
There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh, for he _was_ the firstborn of Joseph: _namely_ for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, because he was a man of war; therefore he was given Gilead and Bashan. 

###### 2 
And there was _a lot_ for the rest of the children of Manasseh according to their families: for the children of [^a]Abiezer, the children of Helek, the children of Asriel, the children of Shechem, the children of Hepher, and the children of Shemida; these _were_ the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph according to their families. 

###### 3 
But Zelophehad the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but only daughters. And these _are_ the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. 

###### 4 
And they came near before Eleazar the priest, before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the rulers, saying, "The Lord commanded Moses to give us an [^b]inheritance among our brothers." Therefore, according to the commandment of the Lord, he gave them an inheritance among their father's brothers. 

###### 5 
Ten shares fell to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which _were_ on the other side of the Jordan, 

###### 6 
because the daughters of Manasseh received an inheritance among his sons; and the rest of Manasseh's sons had the land of Gilead. 

###### 7 
And the territory of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethath, that _lies_ east of Shechem; and the border went along south to the inhabitants of En Tappuah. 

###### 8 
Manasseh had the land of Tappuah, but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh _belonged_ to the children of Ephraim. 

###### 9 
And the [^c]border descended to the [^d]Brook Kanah, southward to the brook. These cities of Ephraim _are_ among the cities of Manasseh. The border of Manasseh _was_ on the north side of the brook; and it ended at the sea. 

###### 10 
Southward _it was_ Ephraim's, northward _it was_ Manasseh's, and the sea was its border. Manasseh's territory was adjoining Asher on the north and Issachar on the east. 

###### 11 
And in Issachar and in Asher, Manasseh had Beth Shean and its towns, Ibleam and its towns, the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, the inhabitants of En Dor and its towns, the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns--three hilly regions. 

###### 12 
Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out _the inhabitants of_ those cities, but the Canaanites were determined to dwell in that land. 

###### 13 
And it happened, when the children of Israel grew strong, that they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but did not utterly drive them out. ## More Land for Ephraim and Manasseh 

###### 14 
Then the children of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, "Why have you given us _only_ one [^e]lot and one share to inherit, since we _are_ a great people, inasmuch as the Lord has blessed us until now?" 

###### 15 
So Joshua answered them, "If you _are_ a great people, _then_ go up to the forest _country_ and clear a place for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and the giants, since the mountains of Ephraim are too confined for you." 

###### 16 
But the children of Joseph said, "The mountain country is not enough for us; and all the Canaanites who dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, _both those_ who _are_ of Beth Shean and its towns and _those_ who _are_ of the Valley of Jezreel." 

###### 17 
And Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph--to Ephraim and Manasseh--saying, "You _are_ a great people and have great power; you shall not have _only_ one [^f]lot, 

###### 18 
but the mountain country shall be yours. Although it _is_ wooded, you shall cut it down, and its [^g]farthest extent shall be yours; for you shall drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots _and_ are strong."

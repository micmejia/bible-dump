# Lamentations 3

***


###### 1 
I _am_ the man _who_ has seen affliction by the rod of His wrath. 

###### 2 
He has led me and made _me_ walk _In_ darkness and not _in_ light. 

###### 3 
Surely He has turned His hand against me Time and time again throughout the day. 

###### 4 
He has aged my flesh and my skin, And broken my bones. 

###### 5 
He has besieged me And surrounded _me_ with bitterness and woe. 

###### 6 
He has set me in dark places Like the dead of long ago. 

###### 7 
He has hedged me in so that I cannot get out; He has made my chain heavy. 

###### 8 
Even when I cry and shout, He shuts out my prayer. 

###### 9 
He has blocked my ways with hewn stone; He has made my paths crooked. 

###### 10 
He _has been_ to me a bear lying in wait, _Like_ a lion in ambush. 

###### 11 
He has turned aside my ways and torn me in pieces; He has made me desolate. 

###### 12 
He has bent His bow And set me up as a target for the arrow. 

###### 13 
He has caused the arrows of His quiver To pierce my loins. 

###### 14 
I have become the ridicule of all my people-- Their taunting song all the day. 

###### 15 
He has filled me with bitterness, He has made me drink wormwood. 

###### 16 
He has also broken my teeth with gravel, And covered me with ashes. 

###### 17 
You have moved my soul far from peace; I have forgotten prosperity. 

###### 18 
And I said, "My strength and my hope Have perished from the Lord." 

###### 19 
Remember my affliction and roaming, The wormwood and the gall. 

###### 20 
My soul still remembers And sinks within me. 

###### 21 
This I recall to my mind, Therefore I have hope. 

###### 22 
_Through_ the Lord's mercies we are not consumed, Because His compassions fail not. 

###### 23 
_They are_ new every morning; Great _is_ Your faithfulness. 

###### 24 
"The Lord _is_ my portion," says my soul, "Therefore I hope in Him!" 

###### 25 
The Lord _is_ good to those who wait for Him, To the soul _who_ seeks Him. 

###### 26 
_It is_ good that _one_ should hope and wait quietly For the salvation of the Lord. 

###### 27 
_It is_ good for a man to bear The yoke in his youth. 

###### 28 
Let him sit alone and keep silent, Because _God_ has laid _it_ on him; 

###### 29 
Let him put his mouth in the dust-- There may yet be hope. 

###### 30 
Let him give _his_ cheek to the one who strikes him, _And_ be full of reproach. 

###### 31 
For the Lord will not cast off forever. 

###### 32 
Though He causes grief, Yet He will show compassion According to the multitude of His mercies. 

###### 33 
For He does not afflict willingly, Nor grieve the children of men. 

###### 34 
To crush under one's feet All the prisoners of the earth, 

###### 35 
To turn aside the justice _due_ a man Before the face of the Most High, 

###### 36 
Or subvert a man in his cause-- The Lord does not approve. 

###### 37 
Who _is_ he _who_ speaks and it comes to pass, _When_ the Lord has not commanded _it?_ 

###### 38 
_Is it_ not from the mouth of the Most High That woe and well-being proceed? 

###### 39 
Why should a living man complain, A man for the punishment of his sins? 

###### 40 
Let us search out and examine our ways, And turn back to the Lord; 

###### 41 
Let us lift our hearts and hands To God in heaven. 

###### 42 
We have transgressed and rebelled; You have not pardoned. 

###### 43 
You have covered _Yourself_ with anger And pursued us; You have slain _and_ not pitied. 

###### 44 
You have covered Yourself with a cloud, That prayer should not pass through. 

###### 45 
You have made us an offscouring and refuse In the midst of the peoples. 

###### 46 
All our enemies Have opened their mouths against us. 

###### 47 
Fear and a snare have come upon us, Desolation and destruction. 

###### 48 
My eyes overflow with rivers of water For the destruction of the daughter of my people. 

###### 49 
My eyes flow and do not cease, Without interruption, 

###### 50 
Till the Lord from heaven Looks down and sees. 

###### 51 
My eyes bring suffering to my soul Because of all the daughters of my city. 

###### 52 
My enemies without cause Hunted me down like a bird. 

###### 53 
They silenced my life in the pit And threw stones at me. 

###### 54 
The waters flowed over my head; I said, "I am cut off!" 

###### 55 
I called on Your name, O Lord, From the lowest pit. 

###### 56 
You have heard my voice: "Do not hide Your ear From my sighing, from my cry for help." 

###### 57 
You drew near on the day I called on You, And said, "Do not fear!" 

###### 58 
O Lord, You have pleaded the case for my soul; You have redeemed my life. 

###### 59 
O Lord, You have seen _how_ I am wronged; Judge my case. 

###### 60 
You have seen all their vengeance, All their schemes against me. 

###### 61 
You have heard their reproach, O Lord, All their schemes against me, 

###### 62 
The lips of my enemies And their whispering against me all the day. 

###### 63 
Look at their sitting down and their rising up; I _am_ their taunting song. 

###### 64 
Repay them, O Lord, According to the work of their hands. 

###### 65 
Give them a veiled heart; Your curse _be_ upon them! 

###### 66 
In Your anger, Pursue and destroy them From under the heavens of the Lord.

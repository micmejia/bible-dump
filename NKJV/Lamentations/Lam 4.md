# Lamentations 4

***


###### 1 
How the gold has become dim! _How_ changed the fine gold! The stones of the sanctuary are [^a]scattered At the head of every street. 

###### 2 
The precious sons of Zion, [^b]Valuable as fine gold, How they are [^c]regarded as clay pots, The work of the hands of the potter! 

###### 3 
Even the jackals present their breasts To nurse their young; _But_ the daughter of my people _is_ cruel, Like ostriches in the wilderness. 

###### 4 
The tongue of the infant clings To the roof of its mouth for thirst; The young children ask for bread, _But_ no one breaks _it_ for them. 

###### 5 
Those who ate delicacies Are desolate in the streets; Those who were brought up in scarlet Embrace ash heaps. 

###### 6 
The punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people Is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, Which was overthrown in a moment, With no hand to help her! 

###### 7 
Her [^d]Nazirites were [^e]brighter than snow And whiter than milk; They were more ruddy in body than rubies, _Like_ sapphire in their [^f]appearance. 

###### 8 
_Now_ their appearance is blacker than soot; They go unrecognized in the streets; Their skin clings to their bones, It has become as dry as wood. 

###### 9 
_Those_ slain by the sword are better off Than _those_ who die of hunger; For these pine away, Stricken _for lack_ of the fruits of the field. 

###### 10 
The hands of the compassionate women Have [^g]cooked their own children; They became food for them In the destruction of the daughter of my people. 

###### 11 
The Lord has fulfilled His fury, He has poured out His fierce anger. He kindled a fire in Zion, And it has devoured its foundations. 

###### 12 
The kings of the earth, And all inhabitants of the world, Would not have believed That the adversary and the enemy Could enter the gates of Jerusalem-- 

###### 13 
Because of the sins of her prophets _And_ the iniquities of her priests, Who shed in her midst The blood of the just. 

###### 14 
They wandered blind in the streets; They have defiled themselves with blood, So that no one would touch their garments. 

###### 15 
They cried out to them, "Go away, unclean! Go away, go away, Do not touch us!" When they fled and wandered, _Those_ among the nations said, "They shall no longer dwell _here._" 

###### 16 
The [^h]face of the Lord scattered them; He no longer regards them. _The people_ do not respect the priests Nor show favor to the elders. 

###### 17 
Still our eyes failed us, _Watching_ vainly for our help; In our watching we watched For a nation _that_ could not save _us._ 

###### 18 
They [^i]tracked our steps So that we could not walk in our streets. Our end was near; Our days were over, For our end had come. 

###### 19 
Our pursuers were swifter Than the eagles of the heavens. They pursued us on the mountains And lay in wait for us in the wilderness. 

###### 20 
The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the Lord, Was caught in their pits, Of whom we said, "Under his shadow We shall live among the nations." 

###### 21 
Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, _You_ who dwell in the land of Uz! The cup shall also pass over to you And you shall become drunk and make yourself naked. 

###### 22 
_The punishment of_ your iniquity [^j]is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; He will no longer send you into captivity. He will punish your iniquity, O daughter of Edom; He will uncover your sins! ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

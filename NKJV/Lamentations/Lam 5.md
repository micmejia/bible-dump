# Lamentations 5

***


###### 1 
Remember, O Lord, what has come upon us; Look, and behold our reproach! 

###### 2 
Our inheritance has been turned over to aliens, And our houses to foreigners. 

###### 3 
We have become orphans and waifs, Our mothers _are_ like widows. 

###### 4 
We pay for the water we drink, And our wood comes at a price. 

###### 5 
_They_ pursue at our [^a]heels; We labor _and_ have no rest. 

###### 6 
We have given our hand _to_ the Egyptians _And_ the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread. 

###### 7 
Our fathers sinned _and are_ no more, But we bear their iniquities. 

###### 8 
Servants rule over us; _There is_ none to deliver _us_ from their hand. 

###### 9 
We get our bread _at the risk_ of our lives, Because of the sword in the wilderness. 

###### 10 
Our skin is hot as an oven, Because of the fever of famine. 

###### 11 
They ravished the women in Zion, The maidens in the cities of Judah. 

###### 12 
Princes were hung up by their hands, And elders were not respected. 

###### 13 
Young men ground at the millstones; Boys staggered under _loads of_ wood. 

###### 14 
The elders have ceased _gathering at_ the gate, And the young men from their music. 

###### 15 
The joy of our heart has ceased; Our dance has turned into mourning. 

###### 16 
The crown has fallen _from_ our head. Woe to us, for we have sinned! 

###### 17 
Because of this our heart is faint; Because of these _things_ our eyes grow dim; 

###### 18 
Because of Mount Zion which is desolate, With foxes walking about on it. 

###### 19 
You, O Lord, remain forever; Your throne from generation to generation. 

###### 20 
Why do You forget us forever, _And_ forsake us for so long a time? 

###### 21 
Turn us back to You, O Lord, and we will be [^b]restored; Renew our days as of old, 

###### 22 
Unless You have utterly rejected us, _And_ are very angry with us!

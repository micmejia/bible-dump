# Leviticus 11

***


###### 1 
Now the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying to them, 

###### 2 
"Speak to the children of Israel, saying, 'These _are_ the animals which you may eat among all the animals that _are_ on the earth: 

###### 3 
Among the animals, whatever divides the hoof, having cloven hooves _and_ chewing the cud--that you may eat. 

###### 4 
Nevertheless these you shall not eat among those that chew the cud or those that have cloven hooves: the camel, because it chews the cud but does not have cloven hooves, is unclean to you; 

###### 5 
the rock hyrax, because it chews the cud but does not have cloven hooves, _is_ unclean to you; 

###### 6 
the hare, because it chews the cud but does not have cloven hooves, _is_ unclean to you; 

###### 7 
and the swine, though it divides the hoof, having cloven hooves, yet does not chew the cud, _is_ unclean to you. 

###### 8 
Their flesh you shall not eat, and their carcasses you shall not touch. They _are_ unclean to you. 

###### 9 
'These you may eat of all that _are_ in the water: whatever in the water has fins and scales, whether in the seas or in the rivers--that you may eat. 

###### 10 
But all in the seas or in the rivers that do not have fins and scales, all that move in the water or any living thing which _is_ in the water, they _are_ an abomination to you. 

###### 11 
They shall be an abomination to you; you shall not eat their flesh, but you shall regard their carcasses as an abomination. 

###### 12 
Whatever in the water does not have fins or scales--that _shall be_ an abomination to you. 

###### 13 
'And these you shall regard as an abomination among the birds; they shall not be eaten, they _are_ an abomination: the eagle, the vulture, the buzzard, 

###### 14 
the kite, and the falcon after its kind; 

###### 15 
every raven after its kind, 

###### 16 
the ostrich, the short-eared owl, the sea gull, and the hawk after its kind; 

###### 17 
the little owl, the fisher owl, and the screech owl; 

###### 18 
the white owl, the jackdaw, and the carrion vulture; 

###### 19 
the stork, the heron after its kind, the hoopoe, and the bat. 

###### 20 
'All flying insects that creep on _all_ fours _shall be_ an abomination to you. 

###### 21 
Yet these you may eat of every flying insect that creeps on _all_ fours: those which have jointed legs above their feet with which to leap on the earth. 

###### 22 
These you may eat: the locust after its kind, the destroying locust after its kind, the cricket after its kind, and the grasshopper after its kind. 

###### 23 
But all _other_ flying insects which have four feet _shall be_ an abomination to you. ## Unclean Animals 

###### 24 
'By these you shall become unclean; whoever touches the carcass of any of them shall be unclean until evening; 

###### 25 
whoever carries part of the carcass of any of them shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening: 

###### 26 
_The carcass_ of any animal which divides the foot, but is not cloven-hoofed or does not chew the cud, _is_ unclean to you. Everyone who touches it shall be unclean. 

###### 27 
And whatever goes on its paws, among all kinds of animals that go on _all_ fours, those _are_ unclean to you. Whoever touches any such carcass shall be unclean until evening. 

###### 28 
Whoever carries _any such_ carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening. It _is_ unclean to you. 

###### 29 
'These also _shall be_ unclean to you among the creeping things that creep on the earth: the mole, the mouse, and the large lizard after its kind; 

###### 30 
the gecko, the monitor lizard, the sand reptile, the sand lizard, and the chameleon. 

###### 31 
These _are_ unclean to you among all that creep. Whoever touches them when they are dead shall be unclean until evening. 

###### 32 
Anything on which _any_ of them falls, when they are dead shall be unclean, whether _it is_ any item of wood or clothing or skin or sack, whatever item _it is_, in which _any_ work is done, it must be put in water. And it shall be unclean until evening; then it shall be clean. 

###### 33 
Any earthen vessel into which _any_ of them falls you shall break; and whatever _is_ in it shall be unclean: 

###### 34 
in such a vessel, any edible food upon which water falls becomes unclean, and any drink that may be drunk from it becomes unclean. 

###### 35 
And everything on which _a part_ of _any such_ carcass falls shall be unclean; _whether it is_ an oven or cooking stove, it shall be broken down; _for_ they _are_ unclean, and shall be unclean to you. 

###### 36 
Nevertheless a spring or a cistern, _in which there is_ plenty of water, shall be clean, but whatever touches any such carcass becomes unclean. 

###### 37 
And if a part of _any such_ carcass falls on any planting seed which is to be sown, it _remains_ clean. 

###### 38 
But if water is put on the seed, and if _a part_ of _any such_ carcass falls on it, it _becomes_ unclean to you. 

###### 39 
'And if any animal which you may eat dies, he who touches its carcass shall be unclean until evening. 

###### 40 
He who eats of its carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening. He also who carries its carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening. 

###### 41 
'And every creeping thing that creeps on the earth _shall be_ an abomination. It shall not be eaten. 

###### 42 
Whatever crawls on its belly, whatever goes on _all_ fours, or whatever has many feet among all creeping things that creep on the earth--these you shall not eat, for they _are_ an abomination. 

###### 43 
You shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creeps; nor shall you make yourselves unclean with them, lest you be defiled by them. 

###### 44 
For I _am_ the Lord your God. You shall therefore consecrate yourselves, and you shall be holy; for I _am_ holy. Neither shall you defile yourselves with any creeping thing that creeps on the earth. 

###### 45 
For I _am_ the Lord who brings you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God. You shall therefore be holy, for I _am_ holy. 

###### 46 
'This _is_ the law of the animals and the birds and every living creature that moves in the waters, and of every creature that creeps on the earth, 

###### 47 
to distinguish between the unclean and the clean, and between the animal that may be eaten and the animal that may not be eaten.' "

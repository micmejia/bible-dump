# Leviticus 12

***


###### 1 
Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 

###### 2 
"Speak to the children of Israel, saying: 'If a woman has conceived, and borne a male child, then she shall be [^a]unclean seven days; as in the days of her customary impurity she shall be unclean. 

###### 3 
And on the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised. 

###### 4 
She shall then continue in the blood of _her_ purification thirty-three days. She shall not touch any [^b]hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary until the days of her purification are fulfilled. 

###### 5 
'But if she bears a female child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her customary impurity, and she shall continue in the blood of _her_ purification sixty-six days. 

###### 6 
'When the days of her purification are fulfilled, whether for a son or a daughter, she shall bring to the priest a lamb [^c]of the first year as a burnt offering, and a young pigeon or a turtledove as a sin offering, to the door of the tabernacle of meeting. 

###### 7 
Then he shall offer it before the Lord, and make [^d]atonement for her. And she shall be clean from the flow of her blood. This _is_ the law for her who has borne a male or a female. 

###### 8 
'And if she is not able to bring a lamb, then she may bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons--one as a burnt offering and the other as a sin offering. So the priest shall make atonement for her, and she will be [^e]clean.' "

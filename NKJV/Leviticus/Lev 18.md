# Leviticus 18

***


###### 1 
Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 

###### 2 
"Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: 'I am the Lord your God. 

###### 3 
According to [^a]the doings of the land of Egypt, where you dwelt, you shall not do; and according to the doings of the land of Canaan, where I am bringing you, you shall not do; nor shall you walk in their [^b]ordinances. 

###### 4 
You shall observe My judgments and keep My ordinances, to walk in them: I _am_ the Lord your God. 

###### 5 
You shall therefore keep My statutes and My judgments, which if a man does, he shall live by them: I _am_ the Lord. 

###### 6 
'None of you shall approach anyone who is near of kin to him, to uncover his nakedness: I _am_ the Lord. 

###### 7 
The nakedness of your father or the nakedness of your mother you shall not uncover. She _is_ your mother; you shall not uncover her nakedness. 

###### 8 
The nakedness of your father's wife you shall not uncover; it _is_ your father's nakedness. 

###### 9 
The nakedness of your sister, the daughter of your father, or the daughter of your mother, _whether_ born at home or elsewhere, their nakedness you shall not uncover. 

###### 10 
The nakedness of your son's daughter or your daughter's daughter, their nakedness you shall not uncover; for theirs _is_ your own nakedness. 

###### 11 
The nakedness of your father's wife's daughter, begotten by your father--she _is_ your sister--you shall not uncover her nakedness. 

###### 12 
You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's sister; she _is_ near of kin to your father. 

###### 13 
You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother's sister, for she _is_ near of kin to your mother. 

###### 14 
You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's brother. You shall not approach his wife; she _is_ your aunt. 

###### 15 
You shall not uncover the nakedness of your daughter-in-law--she _is_ your son's wife--you shall not uncover her nakedness. 

###### 16 
You shall not uncover the nakedness of your brother's wife; it _is_ your brother's nakedness. 

###### 17 
You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter, nor shall you take her son's daughter or her daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness. They _are_ near of kin to her. It _is_ wickedness. 

###### 18 
Nor shall you take a woman as a rival to her sister, to uncover her nakedness while the other is alive. 

###### 19 
'Also you shall not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness as long as she is in her _customary_ impurity. 

###### 20 
Moreover you shall not lie carnally with your neighbor's wife, to defile yourself with her. 

###### 21 
And you shall not let any of your descendants pass through _the fire_ to Molech, nor shall you profane the name of your God: I _am_ the Lord. 

###### 22 
You shall not lie with a male as with a woman. It _is_ an abomination. 

###### 23 
Nor shall you mate with any animal, to defile yourself with it. Nor shall any woman stand before an animal to mate with it. It _is_ perversion. 

###### 24 
'Do not defile yourselves with any of these things; for by all these the nations are defiled, which I am casting out before you. 

###### 25 
For the land is defiled; therefore I visit[^c] the punishment of its iniquity upon it, and the land vomits out its inhabitants. 

###### 26 
You shall therefore [^d]keep My statutes and My judgments, and shall not commit _any_ of these abominations, _either_ any of your own nation or any stranger who dwells among you 

###### 27 
(for all these abominations the men of the land have done, who _were_ before you, and thus the land is defiled), 

###### 28 
lest the land vomit you out also when you defile it, as it vomited out the nations that _were_ before you. 

###### 29 
For whoever commits any of these abominations, the persons who commit _them_ shall be [^e]cut off from among their people. 

###### 30 
'Therefore you shall keep My [^f]ordinance, so that _you_ do not commit _any_ of these abominable customs which were committed before you, and that you do not defile yourselves by them: I _am_ the Lord your God.' "

# Leviticus 22

***


###### 1 
Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 

###### 2 
"Speak to Aaron and his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and that they do not profane My holy name _by_ what they dedicate to Me: I _am_ the Lord. 

###### 3 
Say to them: 'Whoever of all your descendants throughout your generations, who goes near the holy things which the children of Israel dedicate to the Lord, while he has uncleanness upon him, that person shall be cut off from My presence: I _am_ the Lord. 

###### 4 
'Whatever man of the descendants of Aaron, who _is_ a leper or has a discharge, shall not eat the holy offerings until he is clean. And whoever touches anything made unclean _by_ a corpse, or a man who has had an emission of semen, 

###### 5 
or whoever touches any creeping thing by which he would be made unclean, or any person by whom he would become unclean, whatever his uncleanness may be-- 

###### 6 
the person who has touched any such thing shall be unclean until evening, and shall not eat the holy _offerings_ unless he washes his body with water. 

###### 7 
And when the sun goes down he shall be clean; and afterward he may eat the holy _offerings_, because it _is_ his food. 

###### 8 
Whatever dies _naturally_ or is torn _by beasts_ he shall not eat, to defile himself with it: I _am_ the Lord. 

###### 9 
'They shall therefore keep My ordinance, lest they bear sin for it and die thereby, if they profane it: I the Lord sanctify them. 

###### 10 
'No outsider shall eat the holy _offering;_ one who dwells with the priest, or a hired servant, shall not eat the holy thing. 

###### 11 
But if the priest buys a person with his money, he may eat it; and one who is born in his house may eat his food. 

###### 12 
If the priest's daughter is married to an outsider, she may not eat of the holy offerings. 

###### 13 
But if the priest's daughter is a widow or divorced, and has no child, and has returned to her father's house as in her youth, she may eat her father's food; but no outsider shall eat it. 

###### 14 
'And if a man eats the holy _offering_ unintentionally, then he shall restore a holy _offering_ to the priest, and add one-fifth to it. 

###### 15 
They shall not profane the holy _offerings_ of the children of Israel, which they offer to the Lord, 

###### 16 
or allow them to bear the guilt of trespass when they eat their holy _offerings;_ for I the Lord sanctify them.' " 

## Offerings Accepted and Not Accepted 

###### 17 
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 

###### 18 
"Speak to Aaron and his sons, and to all the children of Israel, and say to them: 'Whatever man of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, who offers his sacrifice for any of his vows or for any of his freewill offerings, which they offer to the Lord as a burnt offering-- 

###### 19 
_you shall offer_ of your own free will a male without blemish from the cattle, from the sheep, or from the goats. 

###### 20 
Whatever has a defect, you shall not offer, for it shall not be acceptable on your behalf. 

###### 21 
And whoever offers a sacrifice of a peace offering to the Lord, to fulfill _his_ vow, or a freewill offering from the cattle or the sheep, it must be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no defect in it. 

###### 22 
Those _that are_ blind or broken or maimed, or have an ulcer or eczema or scabs, you shall not offer to the Lord, nor make an offering by fire of them on the altar to the Lord. 

###### 23 
Either a bull or a lamb that has any limb too long or too short you may offer _as_ a freewill offering, but for a vow it shall not be accepted. 

###### 24 
'You shall not offer to the Lord what is bruised or crushed, or torn or cut; nor shall you make _any offering of them_ in your land. 

###### 25 
Nor from a foreigner's hand shall you offer any of these as the bread of your God, because their corruption _is_ in them, _and_ defects _are_ in them. They shall not be accepted on your behalf.' " 

###### 26 
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: 

###### 27 
"When a bull or a sheep or a goat is born, it shall be seven days with its mother; and from the eighth day and thereafter it shall be accepted as an offering made by fire to the Lord. 

###### 28 
_Whether it is_ a cow or ewe, do not kill both her and her young on the same day. 

###### 29 
And when you offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving to the Lord, offer _it_ of your own free will. 

###### 30 
On the same day it shall be eaten; you shall leave none of it until morning: I _am_ the Lord. 

###### 31 
"Therefore you shall keep My commandments, and perform them: I _am_ the Lord. 

###### 32 
You shall not profane My holy name, but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel. I _am_ the Lord who sanctifies you, 

###### 33 
who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I _am_ the Lord."

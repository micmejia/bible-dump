***


###### 1 
The [^a]burden of the word of the Lord to Israel [^b]by Malachi. ## Israel Beloved of God 

###### 2 
"I have loved you," says the Lord. "Yet you say, 'In what way have You loved us?' _Was_ not Esau Jacob's brother?" Says the Lord. "Yet Jacob I have loved; 

###### 3 
But Esau I have hated, And laid waste his mountains and his heritage For the jackals of the wilderness." 

###### 4 
Even though Edom has said, "We have been impoverished, But we will return and build the desolate places," Thus says the Lord of hosts: "They may build, but I will throw down; They shall be called the Territory of Wickedness, And the people against whom the Lord will have indignation forever. 

###### 5 
Your eyes shall see, And you shall say, 'The Lord is magnified beyond the border of Israel.' ## Polluted Offerings 

###### 6 
"A son honors _his_ father, And a servant _his_ master. If then I am the Father, Where _is_ My honor? And if I _am_ a Master, Where _is_ My reverence? Says the Lord of hosts To you priests who despise My name. Yet you say, 'In what way have we despised Your name?' 

###### 7 
"You offer defiled food on My altar, But say, 'In what way have we defiled You?' By saying, 'The table of the Lord is [^c]contemptible.' 

###### 8 
And when you offer the blind as a sacrifice, _Is it_ not evil? And when you offer the lame and sick, _Is it_ not evil? Offer it then to your governor! Would he be pleased with you? Would he accept[^d] you favorably?" Says the Lord of hosts. 

###### 9 
"But now entreat God's favor, That He may be gracious to us. _While_ this is being _done_ by your hands, Will He accept you favorably?" Says the Lord of hosts. 

###### 10 
"Who _is there_ even among you who would shut the doors, So that you would not kindle fire _on_ My altar in vain? I have no pleasure in you," Says the Lord of hosts, "Nor will I accept an offering from your hands. 

###### 11 
For from the rising of the sun, even to its going down, My name _shall be_ great among the Gentiles; In every place incense _shall be_ offered to My name, And a pure offering; For My name shall be great among the nations," Says the Lord of hosts. 

###### 12 
"But you profane it, In that you say, 'The table of the [^e]Lord is defiled; And its fruit, its food, _is_ contemptible.' 

###### 13 
You also say, 'Oh, what a weariness!' And you sneer at it," Says the Lord of hosts. "And you bring the stolen, the lame, and the sick; Thus you bring an offering! Should I accept this from your hand?" Says the Lord. 

###### 14 
"But cursed _be_ the deceiver Who has in his flock a male, And takes a vow, But sacrifices to the Lord what is blemished-- For I _am_ a great King," Says the Lord of hosts, "And My name _is to be_ feared among the nations. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

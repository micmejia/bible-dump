# Mark 12

***


###### 1 
Then He began to speak to them in parables: "A man planted a vineyard and set a hedge around _it,_ dug _a place for_ the wine vat and built a tower. And he leased it to [^a]vinedressers and went into a far country. 

###### 2 
Now at vintage-time he sent a servant to the vinedressers, that he might receive some of the fruit of the vineyard from the vinedressers. 

###### 3 
And they took _him_ and beat him and sent _him_ away empty-handed. 

###### 4 
Again he sent them another servant, [^b]and at him they threw stones, wounded _him_ in the head, and sent _him_ away shamefully treated. 

###### 5 
And again he sent another, and him they killed; and many others, beating some and killing some. 

###### 6 
Therefore still having one son, his beloved, he also sent him to them last, saying, 'They will respect my son.' 

###### 7 
But those [^c]vinedressers said among themselves, 'This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.' 

###### 8 
So they took him and killed _him_ and cast _him_ out of the vineyard. 

###### 9 
"Therefore what will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the vinedressers, and give the vineyard to others. 

###### 10 
Have you not even read this Scripture: 'The stone which the builders rejected Has become the chief cornerstone. 

###### 11 
This was the Lord's doing, And it is marvelous in our eyes'?" 

###### 12 
And they sought to lay hands on Him, but feared the multitude, for they knew He had spoken the parable against them. So they left Him and went away. ## The Pharisees: Is It Lawful to Pay Taxes to Caesar? 

###### 13 
Then they sent to Him some of the Pharisees and the Herodians, to catch Him in _His_ words. 

###### 14 
When they had come, they said to Him, "Teacher, we know that You are true, and [^d]care about no one; for You do not [^e]regard the person of men, but teach the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not? 

###### 15 
Shall we pay, or shall we not pay?" But He, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, "Why do you test Me? Bring Me a denarius that I may see _it._" 

###### 16 
So they brought _it._ And He said to them, "Whose image and inscription _is_ this?" They said to Him, "Caesar's." 

###### 17 
And Jesus answered and said to them, [^f]"Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's." And they marveled at Him. ## The Sadducees: What About the Resurrection? 

###### 18 
Then _some_ Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Him; and they asked Him, saying: 

###### 19 
"Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if a man's brother dies, and leaves _his_ wife behind, and leaves no children, his brother should take his wife and raise up offspring for his brother. 

###### 20 
Now there were seven brothers. The first took a wife; and dying, he left no offspring. 

###### 21 
And the second took her, and he died; nor did he leave any offspring. And the third likewise. 

###### 22 
So the seven had her and left no offspring. Last of all the woman died also. 

###### 23 
Therefore, in the resurrection, when they rise, whose wife will she be? For all seven had her as wife." 

###### 24 
Jesus answered and said to them, "Are you not therefore [^g]mistaken, because you do not know the Scriptures nor the power of God? 

###### 25 
For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven. 

###### 26 
But concerning the dead, that they rise, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the _burning_ bush _passage,_ how God spoke to him, saying, 'I _am_ the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? 

###### 27 
He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living. You are therefore greatly [^h]mistaken." ## The Scribes: Which Is the First Commandment of All? 

###### 28 
Then one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, [^i]perceiving that He had answered them well, asked Him, "Which is the [^j]first commandment of all?" 

###### 29 
Jesus answered him, "The [^k]first of all the commandments _is:_ 'Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. 

###### 30 
And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.' [^l]This _is_ the first commandment. 

###### 31 
And the second, like _it, is_ this: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no other commandment greater than these." 

###### 32 
So the scribe said to Him, "Well _said,_ Teacher. You have spoken the truth, for there is one God, and there is no other but He. 

###### 33 
And to love Him with all the heart, with all the understanding, [^m]with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love one's neighbor as oneself, is more than all the whole burnt offerings and sacrifices." 

###### 34 
Now when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, He said to him, "You are not far from the kingdom of God." But after that no one dared question Him. ## Jesus: How Can David Call His Descendant Lord? 

###### 35 
Then Jesus answered and said, while He taught in the temple, "How _is it_ that the scribes say that the Christ is the Son of David? 

###### 36 
For David himself said by the Holy Spirit: 'The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at My right hand, Till I make Your enemies Your footstool." ' 

###### 37 
Therefore David himself calls Him 'Lord'; how is He _then_ his Son?" And the common people heard Him gladly. ## Beware of the Scribes 

###### 38 
Then He said to them in His teaching, "Beware of the scribes, who desire to go around in long robes, _love_ greetings in the marketplaces, 

###### 39 
the best seats in the synagogues, and the best places at feasts, 

###### 40 
who devour widows' houses, and [^n]for a pretense make long prayers. These will receive greater condemnation." ## The Widow's Two Mites 

###### 41 
Now Jesus sat opposite the treasury and saw how the people put money into the treasury. And many _who were_ rich put in much. 

###### 42 
Then one poor widow came and threw in two [^o]mites, which make a [^p]quadrans. 

###### 43 
So He called His disciples to _Himself_ and said to them, "Assuredly, I say to you that this poor widow has put in more than all those who have given to the treasury; 

###### 44 
for they all put in out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty put in all that she had, her whole livelihood." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

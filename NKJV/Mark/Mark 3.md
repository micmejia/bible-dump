# Mark 3

***


###### 1 
And He entered the synagogue again, and a man was there who had a withered hand. 

###### 2 
So they watched Him closely, whether He would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might [^a]accuse Him. 

###### 3 
And He said to the man who had the withered hand, [^b]"Step forward." 

###### 4 
Then He said to them, "Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?" But they kept silent. 

###### 5 
And when He had looked around at them with anger, being grieved by the hardness of their hearts, He said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." And he stretched _it_ out, and his hand was restored [^c]as whole as the other. 

###### 6 
Then the Pharisees went out and immediately plotted with the Herodians against Him, how they might destroy Him. ## A Great Multitude Follows Jesus 

###### 7 
But Jesus withdrew with His disciples to the sea. And a great multitude from Galilee followed Him, and from Judea 

###### 8 
and Jerusalem and Idumea and beyond the Jordan; and those from Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they heard how many things He was doing, came to Him. 

###### 9 
So He told His disciples that a small boat should be kept ready for Him because of the multitude, lest they should crush Him. 

###### 10 
For He healed many, so that as many as had afflictions pressed about Him to touch Him. 

###### 11 
And the unclean spirits, whenever they saw Him, fell down before Him and cried out, saying, "You are the Son of God." 

###### 12 
But He sternly warned them that they should not make Him known. ## The Twelve Apostles 

###### 13 
And He went up on the mountain and called to _Him_ those He Himself wanted. And they came to Him. 

###### 14 
Then He appointed twelve, [^d]that they might be with Him and that He might send them out to preach, 

###### 15 
and to have [^e]power [^f]to heal sicknesses and to cast out demons: 

###### 16 
[^g]Simon, to whom He gave the name Peter; 

###### 17 
James the _son_ of Zebedee and John the brother of James, to whom He gave the name Boanerges, that is, "Sons of Thunder"; 

###### 18 
Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the _son_ of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Cananite; 

###### 19 
and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him. And they went into a house. ## A House Divided Cannot Stand 

###### 20 
Then the multitude came together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread. 

###### 21 
But when His own people heard _about this,_ they went out to lay hold of Him, for they said, "He is out of His mind." 

###### 22 
And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, "He has Beelzebub," and, "By the ruler of the demons He casts out demons." 

###### 23 
So He called them to _Himself_ and said to them in parables: "How can Satan cast out Satan? 

###### 24 
If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. 

###### 25 
And if a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand. 

###### 26 
And if Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided, he cannot stand, but has an end. 

###### 27 
No one can enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man. And then he will plunder his house. ## The Unpardonable Sin 

###### 28 
"Assuredly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they may utter; 

###### 29 
but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is subject to eternal condemnation"-- 

###### 30 
because they said, "He has an unclean spirit." ## Jesus' Mother and Brothers Send for Him 

###### 31 
Then His brothers and His mother came, and standing outside they sent to Him, calling Him. 

###### 32 
And a multitude was sitting around Him; and they said to Him, "Look, Your mother and Your brothers [^h]are outside seeking You." 

###### 33 
But He answered them, saying, "Who is My mother, or My brothers?" 

###### 34 
And He looked around in a circle at those who sat about Him, and said, "Here are My mother and My brothers! 

###### 35 
For whoever does the will of God is My brother and My sister and mother." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

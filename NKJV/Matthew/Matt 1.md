# Matthew 1

***


###### 1 
The book of the genealogy[^a] of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the Son of Abraham: 

###### 2 
Abraham begot Isaac, Isaac begot Jacob, and Jacob begot Judah and his brothers. 

###### 3 
Judah begot Perez and Zerah by Tamar, Perez begot Hezron, and Hezron begot Ram. 

###### 4 
Ram begot Amminadab, Amminadab begot Nahshon, and Nahshon begot Salmon. 

###### 5 
Salmon begot Boaz by Rahab, Boaz begot Obed by Ruth, Obed begot Jesse, 

###### 6 
and Jesse begot David the king. David the king begot Solomon by her [^b]_who had been the wife_ of Uriah. 

###### 7 
Solomon begot Rehoboam, Rehoboam begot Abijah, and Abijah begot [^c]Asa. 

###### 8 
Asa begot Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat begot Joram, and Joram begot Uzziah. 

###### 9 
Uzziah begot Jotham, Jotham begot Ahaz, and Ahaz begot Hezekiah. 

###### 10 
Hezekiah begot Manasseh, Manasseh begot [^d]Amon, and Amon begot Josiah. 

###### 11 
Josiah begot [^e]Jeconiah and his brothers about the time they were carried away to Babylon. 

###### 12 
And after they were brought to Babylon, Jeconiah begot Shealtiel, and Shealtiel begot Zerubbabel. 

###### 13 
Zerubbabel begot Abiud, Abiud begot Eliakim, and Eliakim begot Azor. 

###### 14 
Azor begot Zadok, Zadok begot Achim, and Achim begot Eliud. 

###### 15 
Eliud begot Eleazar, Eleazar begot Matthan, and Matthan begot Jacob. 

###### 16 
And Jacob begot Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus who is called Christ. 

###### 17 
So all the generations from Abraham to David _are_ fourteen generations, from David until the captivity in Babylon _are_ fourteen generations, and from the captivity in Babylon until the Christ _are_ fourteen generations. ## Christ Born of Mary 

###### 18 
Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: After His mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Spirit. 

###### 19 
Then Joseph her husband, being [^f]a just _man,_ and not wanting to make her a public example, was minded to put her away secretly. 

###### 20 
But while he thought about these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take to you Mary your wife, for that which is [^g]conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. 

###### 21 
And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name [^h]Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins." 

###### 22 
So all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying: 

###### 23 
"Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and bear a Son, and they shall call His name Immanuel," which is translated, "God with us." 

###### 24 
Then Joseph, being aroused from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took to him his wife, 

###### 25 
and [^i]did not know her till she had brought forth her[^j] firstborn Son. And he called His name Jesus. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Matthew 15

***


###### 1 
Then the scribes and Pharisees who were from Jerusalem came to Jesus, saying, 

###### 2 
"Why do Your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread." 

###### 3 
He answered and said to them, "Why do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition? 

###### 4 
For God commanded, saying, 'Honor your father and your mother'; and, 'He who curses father or mother, let him be put to death.' 

###### 5 
But you say, 'Whoever says to his father or mother, "Whatever profit you might have received from me _is_ a gift _to God_"-- 

###### 6 
then he need not honor his father [^a]or mother.' Thus you have made the [^b]commandment of God of no effect by your tradition. 

###### 7 
Hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy about you, saying: 

###### 8 
'These people [^c]draw near to Me with their mouth, And honor Me with _their_ lips, But their heart is far from Me. 

###### 9 
And in vain they worship Me, Teaching _as_ doctrines the commandments of men.' " 

###### 10 
When He had called the multitude to _Himself,_ He said to them, "Hear and understand: 

###### 11 
Not what goes into the mouth defiles a man; but what comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man." 

###### 12 
Then His disciples came and said to Him, "Do You know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?" 

###### 13 
But He answered and said, "Every plant which My heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted. 

###### 14 
Let them alone. They are blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind leads the blind, both will fall into a ditch." 

###### 15 
Then Peter answered and said to Him, "Explain this parable to us." 

###### 16 
So Jesus said, "Are you also still without understanding? 

###### 17 
Do you not yet understand that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and is eliminated? 

###### 18 
But those things which proceed out of the mouth come from the heart, and they defile a man. 

###### 19 
For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies. 

###### 20 
These are _the things_ which defile a man, but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man." ## A Gentile Shows Her Faith 

###### 21 
Then Jesus went out from there and departed to the region of Tyre and Sidon. 

###### 22 
And behold, a woman of Canaan came from that region and cried out to Him, saying, "Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David! My daughter is severely demon-possessed." 

###### 23 
But He answered her not a word. And His disciples came and urged Him, saying, "Send her away, for she cries out after us." 

###### 24 
But He answered and said, "I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel." 

###### 25 
Then she came and worshiped Him, saying, "Lord, help me!" 

###### 26 
But He answered and said, "It is not good to take the children's bread and throw _it_ to the little dogs." 

###### 27 
And she said, "Yes, Lord, yet even the little dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters' table." 

###### 28 
Then Jesus answered and said to her, "O woman, great _is_ your faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that very hour. ## Jesus Heals Great Multitudes 

###### 29 
Jesus departed from there, skirted the Sea of Galilee, and went up on the mountain and sat down there. 

###### 30 
Then great multitudes came to Him, having with them _the_ lame, blind, mute, [^d]maimed, and many others; and they laid them down at Jesus' feet, and He healed them. 

###### 31 
So the multitude marveled when they saw _the_ mute speaking, _the_ [^e]maimed made whole, _the_ lame walking, and _the_ blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel. ## Feeding the Four Thousand 

###### 32 
Now Jesus called His disciples to _Himself_ and said, "I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now continued with Me three days and have nothing to eat. And I do not want to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way." 

###### 33 
Then His disciples said to Him, "Where could we get enough bread in the wilderness to fill such a great multitude?" 

###### 34 
Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do you have?" And they said, "Seven, and a few little fish." 

###### 35 
So He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground. 

###### 36 
And He took the seven loaves and the fish and gave thanks, broke _them_ and gave _them_ to His disciples; and the disciples _gave_ to the multitude. 

###### 37 
So they all ate and were filled, and they took up seven large baskets full of the fragments that were left. 

###### 38 
Now those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children. 

###### 39 
And He sent away the multitude, got into the boat, and came to the region of [^f]Magdala. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

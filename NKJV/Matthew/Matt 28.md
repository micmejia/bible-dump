# Matthew 28

***


###### 1 
Now after the Sabbath, as the first _day_ of the week began to dawn, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb. 

###### 2 
And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone [^a]from the door, and sat on it. 

###### 3 
His countenance was like lightning, and his clothing as white as snow. 

###### 4 
And the guards shook for fear of him, and became like dead _men._ 

###### 5 
But the angel answered and said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified. 

###### 6 
He is not here; for He is risen, as He said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay. 

###### 7 
And go quickly and tell His disciples that He is risen from the dead, and indeed He is going before you into Galilee; there you will see Him. Behold, I have told you." 

###### 8 
So they went out quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring His disciples word. ## The Women Worship the Risen Lord 

###### 9 
And [^b]as they went to tell His disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, "Rejoice!" So they came and held Him by the feet and worshiped Him. 

###### 10 
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go _and_ tell My brethren to go to Galilee, and there they will see Me." ## The Soldiers Are Bribed 

###### 11 
Now while they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city and reported to the chief priests all the things that had happened. 

###### 12 
When they had assembled with the elders and consulted together, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers, 

###### 13 
saying, "Tell them, 'His disciples came at night and stole Him _away_ while we slept.' 

###### 14 
And if this comes to the governor's ears, we will appease him and make you secure." 

###### 15 
So they took the money and did as they were instructed; and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day. ## The Great Commission 

###### 16 
Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus had appointed for them. 

###### 17 
When they saw Him, they worshiped Him; but some doubted. 

###### 18 
And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. 

###### 19 
Go [^c]therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 

###### 20 
teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, _even_ to the end of the age." [^d]Amen. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

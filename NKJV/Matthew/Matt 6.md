# Matthew 6

***


###### 1 
"Take heed that you do not do your charitable deeds before men, to be seen by them. Otherwise you have no reward from your Father in heaven. 

###### 2 
Therefore, when you do a charitable deed, do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory from men. Assuredly, I say to you, they have their reward. 

###### 3 
But when you do a charitable deed, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, 

###### 4 
that your charitable deed may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will Himself reward you [^a]openly. ## The Model Prayer 

###### 5 
"And when you pray, you shall not be like the [^b]hypocrites. For they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Assuredly, I say to you, they have their reward. 

###### 6 
But you, when you pray, go into your room, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father who _is_ in the secret _place;_ and your Father who sees in secret will reward you [^c]openly. 

###### 7 
And when you pray, do not use vain repetitions as the heathen _do._ For they think that they will be heard for their many words. 

###### 8 
"Therefore do not be like them. For your Father knows the things you have need of before you ask Him. 

###### 9 
In this manner, therefore, pray: Our Father in heaven, Hallowed be Your name. 

###### 10 
Your kingdom come. Your will be done On earth as _it is_ in heaven. 

###### 11 
Give us this day our daily bread. 

###### 12 
And forgive us our debts, As we forgive our debtors. 

###### 13 
And do not lead us into temptation, But deliver us from the evil one. [^d]For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen. 

###### 14 
"For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. 

###### 15 
But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. ## Fasting to Be Seen Only by God 

###### 16 
"Moreover, when you fast, do not be like the [^e]hypocrites, with a sad countenance. For they disfigure their faces that they may appear to men to be fasting. Assuredly, I say to you, they have their reward. 

###### 17 
But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, 

###### 18 
so that you do not appear to men to be fasting, but to your Father who _is_ in the secret _place;_ and your Father who sees in secret will reward you [^f]openly. ## Lay Up Treasures in Heaven 

###### 19 
"Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal; 

###### 20 
but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. 

###### 21 
For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. ## The Lamp of the Body 

###### 22 
"The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is [^g]good, your whole body will be full of light. 

###### 23 
But if your eye is [^h]bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you is darkness, how great _is_ that darkness! ## You Cannot Serve God and Riches 

###### 24 
"No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and [^i]mammon. ## Do Not Worry 

###### 25 
"Therefore I say to you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink; nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food and the body more than clothing? 

###### 26 
Look at the birds of the air, for they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? 

###### 27 
Which of you by worrying can add one [^j]cubit to his [^k]stature? 

###### 28 
"So why do you worry about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin; 

###### 29 
and yet I say to you that even Solomon in all his glory was not [^l]arrayed like one of these. 

###### 30 
Now if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, _will He_ not much more _clothe_ you, O you of little faith? 

###### 31 
"Therefore do not worry, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?' 

###### 32 
For after all these things the Gentiles seek. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. 

###### 33 
But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you. 

###### 34 
Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about its own things. Sufficient for the day _is_ its own trouble. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

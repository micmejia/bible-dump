# Micah 2

***


###### 1 
Woe to those who devise iniquity, And [^a]work out evil on their beds! At morning light they practice it, Because it is in the power of their hand. 

###### 2 
They covet fields and take _them_ by violence, Also houses, and seize _them._ So they oppress a man and his house, A man and his inheritance. 

###### 3 
Therefore thus says the Lord: "Behold, against this family I am devising disaster, From which you cannot remove your necks; Nor shall you walk haughtily, For this _is_ an evil time. 

###### 4 
In that day _one_ shall take up a proverb against you, And lament with a bitter lamentation, saying: 'We are utterly destroyed! He has changed the [^b]heritage of my people; How He has removed _it_ from me! To [^c]a turncoat He has divided our fields.' " 

###### 5 
Therefore you will have no [^d]one to determine boundaries by lot In the assembly of the Lord. ## Lying Prophets 

###### 6 
"Do not prattle," _you say to those_ who [^e]prophesy. So they shall not prophesy [^f]to you; [^g]They shall not return insult for insult. 

###### 7 
_You who are_ named the house of Jacob: "Is the Spirit of the Lord restricted? _Are_ these His doings? Do not My words do good To him who walks uprightly? 

###### 8 
"Lately My people have risen up as an enemy-- You pull off the robe with the garment From those who trust _you,_ as they pass by, Like men returned from war. 

###### 9 
The women of My people you cast out From their pleasant houses; From their children You have taken away My glory forever. 

###### 10 
"Arise and depart, For this _is_ not _your_ rest; Because it is defiled, it shall destroy, Yes, with utter destruction. 

###### 11 
If a man should walk in a false spirit And speak a lie, _saying,_ 'I will [^h]prophesy to you [^i]of wine and drink,' Even he would be the prattler of this people. ## Israel Restored 

###### 12 
"I will surely assemble all of you, O Jacob, I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together like sheep of [^j]the fold, Like a flock in the midst of their pasture; They shall make a loud noise because of _so many_ people. 

###### 13 
The one who breaks open will come up before them; They will break out, Pass through the gate, And go out by it; Their king will pass before them, With the Lord at their head." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

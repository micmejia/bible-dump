# Micah 5

***


###### 1 
Now gather yourself in troops, O daughter of troops; He has laid siege against us; They will strike the judge of Israel with a rod on the cheek. ## The Coming Messiah 

###### 2 
"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, _Though_ you are little among the thousands of Judah, _Yet_ out of you shall come forth to Me The One to be Ruler in Israel, Whose goings forth _are_ from of old, From [^a]everlasting." 

###### 3 
Therefore He shall give them up, Until the time _that_ she who is in labor has given birth; Then the remnant of His brethren Shall return to the children of Israel. 

###### 4 
And He shall stand and feed[^b] _His flock_ In the strength of the Lord, In the majesty of the name of the Lord His God; And they shall abide, For now He shall be great To the ends of the earth; 

###### 5 
And this _One_ shall be peace. ## Judgment on Israel's Enemies When the Assyrian comes into our land, And when he treads in our palaces, Then we will raise against him Seven shepherds and eight princely men. 

###### 6 
They shall [^c]waste with the sword the land of Assyria, And the land of Nimrod at its entrances; Thus He shall deliver _us_ from the Assyrian, When he comes into our land And when he treads within our borders. 

###### 7 
Then the remnant of Jacob Shall be in the midst of many peoples, Like dew from the Lord, Like showers on the grass, That [^d]tarry for no man Nor [^e]wait for the sons of men. 

###### 8 
And the remnant of Jacob Shall be among the Gentiles, In the midst of many peoples, Like a lion among the beasts of the forest, Like a young lion among flocks of sheep, Who, if he passes through, Both treads down and tears in pieces, And none can deliver. 

###### 9 
Your hand shall be lifted against your adversaries, And all your enemies shall be [^f]cut off. 

###### 10 
"And it shall be in that day," says the Lord, "That I will cut[^g] off your horses from your midst And destroy your chariots. 

###### 11 
I will cut off the cities of your land And throw down all your strongholds. 

###### 12 
I will cut off sorceries from your hand, And you shall have no soothsayers. 

###### 13 
Your carved images I will also cut off, And your _sacred_ pillars from your midst; You shall no more worship the work of your hands; 

###### 14 
I will pluck your [^h]wooden images from your midst; Thus I will destroy your cities. 

###### 15 
And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury On the nations that have not [^i]heard." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

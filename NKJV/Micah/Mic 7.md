# Micah 7

***


###### 1 
Woe is me! For I am like those who gather summer fruits, Like those who glean vintage grapes; _There is no_ cluster to eat Of the first-ripe fruit _which_ my soul desires. 

###### 2 
The faithful _man_ has perished from the earth, And _there is_ no one upright among men. They all lie in wait for blood; Every man hunts his brother with a net. 

###### 3 
That they may successfully do evil with both hands-- The prince asks _for gifts,_ The judge _seeks_ a bribe, And the great _man_ utters his evil desire; So they scheme together. 

###### 4 
The best of them _is_ like a brier; The most upright _is sharper_ than a thorn hedge; The day of your watchman and your punishment comes; Now shall be their perplexity. 

###### 5 
Do not trust in a friend; Do not put your confidence in a companion; Guard the doors of your mouth From her who lies in your bosom. 

###### 6 
For son dishonors father, Daughter rises against her mother, Daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; A man's enemies _are_ the men of his own household. 

###### 7 
Therefore I will look to the Lord; I will wait for the God of my salvation; My God will hear me. ## Israel's Confession and Comfort 

###### 8 
Do not rejoice over me, my enemy; When I fall, I will arise; When I sit in darkness, The Lord _will be_ a light to me. 

###### 9 
I will bear the indignation of the Lord, Because I have sinned against Him, Until He pleads my case And executes justice for me. He will bring me forth to the light; I will see His righteousness. 

###### 10 
Then _she who is_ my enemy will see, And shame will cover her who said to me, "Where is the Lord your God?" My eyes will see her; Now she will be trampled down Like mud in the streets. 

###### 11 
_In_ the day when your walls are to be built, _In_ that day the decree shall go far and wide. 

###### 12 
_In_ that day they shall come to you From Assyria and the fortified cities, From the fortress to the River, From sea to sea, And mountain _to_ mountain. 

###### 13 
Yet the land shall be desolate Because of those who dwell in it, And for the fruit of their deeds. ## God Will Forgive Israel 

###### 14 
Shepherd Your people with Your staff, The flock of Your heritage, Who dwell solitarily _in_ a woodland, In the midst of Carmel; Let them feed _in_ Bashan and Gilead, As in days of old. 

###### 15 
"As in the days when you came out of the land of Egypt, I will show them wonders." 

###### 16 
The nations shall see and be ashamed of all their might; They shall put _their_ hand over _their_ mouth; Their ears shall be deaf. 

###### 17 
They shall lick the dust like a serpent; They shall crawl from their holes like snakes of the earth. They shall be afraid of the Lord our God, And shall fear because of You. 

###### 18 
Who _is_ a God like You, Pardoning iniquity And passing over the transgression of the remnant of His heritage? He does not retain His anger forever, Because He delights _in_ mercy. 

###### 19 
He will again have compassion on us, And will subdue our iniquities. You will cast all our sins Into the depths of the sea. 

###### 20 
You will give truth to Jacob _And_ mercy to Abraham, Which You have sworn to our fathers From days of old.

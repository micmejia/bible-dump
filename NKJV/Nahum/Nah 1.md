# Nahum 1

***


###### 1 
The [^a]burden against Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite. ## God's Wrath on His Enemies 

###### 2 
God _is_ jealous, and the Lord avenges; The Lord avenges and _is_ furious. The Lord will take vengeance on His adversaries, And He reserves _wrath_ for His enemies; 

###### 3 
The Lord _is_ slow to anger and great in power, And will not at all acquit _the wicked._ The Lord has His way In the whirlwind and in the storm, And the clouds _are_ the dust of His feet. 

###### 4 
He rebukes the sea and makes it dry, And dries up all the rivers. Bashan and Carmel wither, And the flower of Lebanon wilts. 

###### 5 
The mountains quake before Him, The hills melt, And the earth [^b]heaves at His presence, Yes, the world and all who dwell in it. 

###### 6 
Who can stand before His indignation? And who can endure the fierceness of His anger? His fury is poured out like fire, And the rocks are thrown down by Him. 

###### 7 
The Lord _is_ good, A stronghold in the day of trouble; And He knows those who trust in Him. 

###### 8 
But with an overflowing flood He will make an utter end of its place, And darkness will pursue His enemies. 

###### 9 
What do you [^c]conspire against the Lord? He will make an utter end _of it._ Affliction will not rise up a second time. 

###### 10 
For while tangled _like_ thorns, And while drunken _like_ drunkards, They shall be devoured like stubble fully dried. 

###### 11 
From you comes forth _one_ Who plots evil against the Lord, A [^d]wicked counselor. 

###### 12 
Thus says the Lord: "Though _they are_ [^e]safe, and likewise many, Yet in this manner they will be cut down When he passes through. Though I have afflicted you, I will afflict you no more; 

###### 13 
For now I will break off his yoke from you, And burst your bonds apart." 

###### 14 
The Lord has given a command concerning you: [^f]"Your name shall be perpetuated no longer. Out of the house of your gods I will cut off the carved image and the molded image. I will dig your grave, For you are vile."[^g] 

###### 15 
Behold, on the mountains The feet of him who brings good tidings, Who proclaims peace! O Judah, keep your appointed feasts, Perform your vows. For the [^h]wicked one shall no more pass through you; He is utterly cut off. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Nahum 2

***


###### 1 
He who scatters has come up before your face. Man the fort! Watch the road! Strengthen _your_ flanks! Fortify _your_ power mightily. 

###### 2 
For the Lord will restore the excellence of Jacob Like the excellence of Israel, For the emptiers have emptied them out And ruined their vine branches. 

###### 3 
The shields of his mighty men _are_ made red, The valiant men _are_ in scarlet. The chariots _come_ with flaming torches In the day of his preparation, And the spears are brandished. 

###### 4 
The chariots rage in the streets, They jostle one another in the broad roads; They seem like torches, They run like lightning. 

###### 5 
He remembers his nobles; They stumble in their walk; They make haste to her walls, And the defense is prepared. 

###### 6 
The gates of the rivers are opened, And the palace is dissolved. 

###### 7 
It is decreed: She shall be led away captive, She shall be brought up; And her maidservants shall lead _her_ as with the voice of doves, Beating their breasts. 

###### 8 
Though Nineveh of old _was_ like a pool of water, Now they flee away. "Halt! Halt!" _they cry;_ But no one turns back. 

###### 9 
Take spoil of silver! Take spoil of gold! _There is_ no end of treasure, Or wealth of every desirable prize. 

###### 10 
She is empty, desolate, and waste! The heart melts, and the knees shake; Much pain _is_ in every side, And all their faces are drained of color. 

###### 11 
Where _is_ the dwelling of the lions, And the feeding place of the young lions, Where the lion walked, the lioness _and_ lion's cub, And no one made _them_ afraid? 

###### 12 
The lion tore in pieces enough for his cubs, Killed for his lionesses, Filled his caves with prey, And his dens with flesh. 

###### 13 
"Behold, I _am_ against you," says the Lord of hosts, "I will burn your chariots in smoke, and the sword shall devour your young lions; I will cut off your prey from the earth, and the voice of your messengers shall be heard no more."

# Nahum 3

***


###### 1 
Woe to the bloody city! It _is_ all full of lies _and_ robbery. _Its_ victim never departs. 

###### 2 
The noise of a whip And the noise of rattling wheels, Of galloping horses, Of clattering chariots! 

###### 3 
Horsemen charge with bright sword and glittering spear. _There is_ a multitude of slain, A great number of bodies, Countless corpses-- They stumble over the corpses-- 

###### 4 
Because of the multitude of harlotries of the seductive harlot, The mistress of sorceries, Who sells nations through her harlotries, And families through her sorceries. 

###### 5 
"Behold, I _am_ against you," says the Lord of hosts; "I will lift your skirts over your face, I will show the nations your nakedness, And the kingdoms your shame. 

###### 6 
I will cast abominable filth upon you, Make you vile, And make you a spectacle. 

###### 7 
It shall come to pass _that_ all who look upon you Will flee from you, and say, 'Nineveh is laid waste! Who will bemoan her?' Where shall I seek comforters for you?" 

###### 8 
Are you better than No Amon _That was_ situated by the River, That had the waters around her, Whose rampart _was_ the sea, Whose wall _was_ the sea? 

###### 9 
Ethiopia and Egypt _were_ her strength, And _it was_ boundless; Put and Lubim were your helpers. 

###### 10 
Yet she _was_ carried away, She went into captivity; Her young children also were dashed to pieces At the head of every street; They cast lots for her honorable men, And all her great men were bound in chains. 

###### 11 
You also will be drunk; You will be hidden; You also will seek refuge from the enemy. 

###### 12 
All your strongholds _are_ fig trees with ripened figs: If they are shaken, They fall into the mouth of the eater. 

###### 13 
Surely, your people in your midst _are_ women! The gates of your land are wide open for your enemies; Fire shall devour the bars of your _gates._ 

###### 14 
Draw your water for the siege! Fortify your strongholds! Go into the clay and tread the mortar! Make strong the brick kiln! 

###### 15 
There the fire will devour you, The sword will cut you off; It will eat you up like a locust. Make yourself many--like the locust! Make yourself many--like the _swarming_ locusts! 

###### 16 
You have multiplied your merchants more than the stars of heaven. The locust plunders and flies away. 

###### 17 
Your commanders _are_ like _swarming_ locusts, And your generals like great grasshoppers, Which camp in the hedges on a cold day; When the sun rises they flee away, And the place where they _are_ is not known. 

###### 18 
Your shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria; Your nobles rest _in the dust._ Your people are scattered on the mountains, And no one gathers them. 

###### 19 
Your injury _has_ no healing, Your wound is severe. All who hear news of you Will clap _their_ hands over you, For upon whom has not your wickedness passed continually?

# Numbers 28

***


###### 1 
Now the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 

###### 2 
"Command the children of Israel, and say to them, 'My offering, My food for My offerings made by fire as a sweet aroma to Me, you shall be careful to offer to Me at their appointed time.' 

###### 3 
"And you shall say to them, 'This _is_ the offering made by fire which you shall offer to the Lord: two male lambs in their first year without blemish, day by day, as a regular burnt offering. 

###### 4 
The one lamb you shall offer in the morning, the other lamb you shall offer in the evening, 

###### 5 
and one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a grain offering mixed with one-fourth of a hin of pressed oil. 

###### 6 
_It is_ a regular burnt offering which was ordained at Mount Sinai for a sweet aroma, an offering made by fire to the Lord. 

###### 7 
And its drink offering _shall be_ one-fourth of a hin for each lamb; in a holy _place_ you shall pour out the drink to the Lord as an offering. 

###### 8 
The other lamb you shall offer in the evening; as the morning grain offering and its drink offering, you shall offer _it_ as an offering made by fire, a [^a]sweet aroma to the Lord. ## Sabbath Offerings 

###### 9 
'And on the Sabbath day two lambs in their first year, without blemish, and two-tenths _of an ephah_ of fine flour as a grain offering, mixed with oil, with its drink offering-- 

###### 10 
_this is_ the burnt offering for every Sabbath, besides the regular burnt offering with its drink offering. ## Monthly Offerings 

###### 11 
'At the beginnings of your months you shall present a burnt offering to the Lord: two young bulls, one ram, and seven lambs in their first year, without blemish; 

###### 12 
three-tenths _of an ephah_ of fine flour as a grain offering, mixed with oil, for each bull; two-tenths _of an ephah_ of fine flour as a grain offering, mixed with oil, for the one ram; 

###### 13 
and one-tenth _of an ephah_ of fine flour, mixed with oil, as a grain offering for each lamb, as a burnt offering of sweet aroma, an offering made by fire to the Lord. 

###### 14 
Their drink offering shall be half a hin of wine for a bull, one-third of a hin for a ram, and one-fourth of a hin for a lamb; this _is_ the burnt offering for each month throughout the months of the year. 

###### 15 
Also one kid of the goats as a sin offering to the Lord shall be offered, besides the regular burnt offering and its drink offering. ## Offerings at Passover 

###### 16 
'On the fourteenth day of the first month _is_ the Passover of the Lord. 

###### 17 
And on the fifteenth day of this month _is_ the feast; unleavened bread shall be eaten for seven days. 

###### 18 
On the first day _you shall have_ a holy [^b]convocation. You shall do no [^c]customary work. 

###### 19 
And you shall present an offering made by fire as a burnt offering to the Lord: two young bulls, one ram, and seven lambs in their first year. Be sure they are without blemish. 

###### 20 
Their grain offering shall be of fine flour mixed with oil: three-tenths _of an ephah_ you shall offer for a bull, and two-tenths for a ram; 

###### 21 
you shall offer one-tenth _of an ephah_ for each of the seven lambs; 

###### 22 
also one goat _as_ a sin offering, to make [^d]atonement for you. 

###### 23 
You shall offer these besides the burnt offering of the morning, which _is_ for a regular burnt offering. 

###### 24 
In this manner you shall offer the food of the offering made by fire daily for seven days, as a sweet aroma to the Lord; it shall be offered besides the regular burnt offering and its drink offering. 

###### 25 
And on the seventh day you shall have a holy convocation. You shall do no customary work. ## Offerings at the Feast of Weeks 

###### 26 
'Also on the day of the firstfruits, when you bring a new grain offering to the Lord at your _Feast of_ Weeks, you shall have a holy convocation. You shall do no customary work. 

###### 27 
You shall present a burnt offering as a sweet aroma to the Lord: two young bulls, one ram, and seven lambs in their first year, 

###### 28 
with their grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil: three-tenths _of an ephah_ for each bull, two-tenths for the one ram, 

###### 29 
and one-tenth for each of the seven lambs; 

###### 30 
_also_ one kid of the goats, to make [^e]atonement for you. 

###### 31 
Be sure they are without [^f]blemish. You shall present _them_ with their drink offerings, besides the regular burnt offering with its grain offering.

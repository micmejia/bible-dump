# Numbers 5

***


###### 1 
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: 

###### 2 
"Command the children of Israel that they put out of the camp every leper, everyone who has a discharge, and whoever becomes defiled by a corpse. 

###### 3 
You shall put out both male and female; you shall put them outside the camp, that they may not defile their camps in the midst of which I dwell." 

###### 4 
And the children of Israel did so, and put them outside the camp; as the Lord spoke to Moses, so the children of Israel did.

## Confession and Restitution 

###### 5 
Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 

###### 6 
"Speak to the children of Israel: 'When a man or woman commits any sin that men commit in unfaithfulness against the Lord, and that person is guilty, 

###### 7 
then he shall confess the sin which he has committed. He shall make restitution for his trespass in full, plus one-fifth of it, and give _it_ to the one he has wronged. 

###### 8 
But if the man has no relative to whom restitution may be made for the wrong, the restitution for the wrong _must go_ to the Lord for the priest, in addition to the ram of the atonement with which atonement is made for him. 

###### 9 
Every offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they bring to the priest, shall be his. 

###### 10 
And every man's holy things shall be his; whatever any man gives the priest shall be his.' " 

## Concerning Unfaithful Wives 

###### 11 
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 

###### 12 
"Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: 'If any man's wife goes astray and behaves unfaithfully toward him, 

###### 13 
and a man lies with her carnally, and it is hidden from the eyes of her husband, and it is concealed that she has defiled herself, and _there was_ no witness against her, nor was she caught-- 

###### 14 
if the spirit of jealousy comes upon him and he becomes jealous of his wife, who has defiled herself; or if the spirit of jealousy comes upon him and he becomes jealous of his wife, although she has not defiled herself-- 

###### 15 
then the man shall bring his wife to the priest. He shall bring the offering required for her, one-tenth of an ephah of barley meal; he shall pour no oil on it and put no frankincense on it, because it _is_ a grain offering of jealousy, an offering for remembering, for bringing iniquity to remembrance. 

###### 16 
'And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the Lord. 

###### 17 
The priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel, and take some of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle and put _it_ into the water. 

###### 18 
Then the priest shall stand the woman before the Lord, uncover the woman's head, and put the offering for remembering in her hands, which _is_ the grain offering of jealousy. And the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that brings a curse. 

###### 19 
And the priest shall put her under oath, and say to the woman, "If no man has lain with you, and if you have not gone astray to uncleanness _while_ under your husband's _authority,_ be free from this bitter water that brings a curse. 

###### 20 
But if you have gone astray _while_ under your husband's _authority,_ and if you have defiled yourself and some man other than your husband has lain with you"-- 

###### 21 
then the priest shall put the woman under the oath of the curse, and he shall say to the woman--"the Lord make you a curse and an oath among your people, when the Lord makes your thigh rot and your belly swell; 

###### 22 
and may this water that causes the curse go into your stomach, and make _your_ belly swell and _your_ thigh rot." 'Then the woman shall say, "Amen, so be it." 

###### 23 
'Then the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall scrape _them_ off into the bitter water. 

###### 24 
And he shall make the woman drink the bitter water that brings a curse, and the water that brings the curse shall enter her _to become_ bitter. 

###### 25 
Then the priest shall take the grain offering of jealousy from the woman's hand, shall wave the offering before the Lord, and bring it to the altar; 

###### 26 
and the priest shall take a handful of the offering, as its memorial portion, burn _it_ on the altar, and afterward make the woman drink the water. 

###### 27 
When he has made her drink the water, then it shall be, if she has defiled herself and behaved unfaithfully toward her husband, that the water that brings a curse will enter her _and become_ bitter, and her belly will swell, her thigh will rot, and the woman will become a curse among her people. 

###### 28 
But if the woman has not defiled herself, and is clean, then she shall be free and may conceive children. 

###### 29 
'This _is_ the law of jealousy, when a wife, _while_ under her husband's _authority,_ goes astray and defiles herself, 

###### 30 
or when the spirit of jealousy comes upon a man, and he becomes jealous of his wife; then he shall stand the woman before the Lord, and the priest shall execute all this law upon her. 

###### 31 
Then the man shall be free from iniquity, but that woman shall bear her guilt.' "

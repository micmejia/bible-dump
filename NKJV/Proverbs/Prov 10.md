# Proverbs 10

###### 1 
The proverbs of Solomon: A wise son makes a glad father, But a foolish son _is_ the grief of his mother. 

###### 2 
Treasures of wickedness profit nothing, But righteousness delivers from death. 

###### 3 
The Lord will not allow the righteous soul to famish, But He casts away the desire of the wicked. 

###### 4 
He who has a slack hand becomes poor, But the hand of the diligent makes rich. 

###### 5 
He who gathers in summer _is_ a wise son; He who sleeps in harvest _is_ a son who causes shame. 

###### 6 
Blessings _are_ on the head of the righteous, But violence covers the mouth of the wicked. 

###### 7 
The memory of the righteous _is_ blessed, But the name of the wicked will rot. 

###### 8 
The wise in heart will receive commands, But a prating fool will fall. 

###### 9 
He who walks with integrity walks securely, But he who perverts his ways will become known. 

###### 10 
He who winks with the eye causes trouble, But a prating fool will fall. 

###### 11 
The mouth of the righteous _is_ a well of life, But violence covers the mouth of the wicked. 

###### 12 
Hatred stirs up strife, But love covers all sins. 

###### 13 
Wisdom is found on the lips of him who has understanding, But a rod _is_ for the back of him who is devoid of understanding. 

###### 14 
Wise _people_ store up knowledge, But the mouth of the foolish _is_ near destruction. 

###### 15 
The rich man's wealth _is_ his strong city; The destruction of the poor _is_ their poverty. 

###### 16 
The labor of the righteous _leads_ to life, The wages of the wicked to sin. 

###### 17 
He who keeps instruction _is in_ the way of life, But he who refuses correction goes astray. 

###### 18 
Whoever hides hatred _has_ lying lips, And whoever spreads slander _is_ a fool. 

###### 19 
In the multitude of words sin is not lacking, But he who restrains his lips _is_ wise. 

###### 20 
The tongue of the righteous _is_ choice silver; The heart of the wicked _is worth_ little. 

###### 21 
The lips of the righteous feed many, But fools die for lack of wisdom. 

###### 22 
The blessing of the Lord makes _one_ rich, And He adds no sorrow with it. 

###### 23 
To do evil _is_ like sport to a fool, But a man of understanding has wisdom. 

###### 24 
The fear of the wicked will come upon him, And the desire of the righteous will be granted. 

###### 25 
When the whirlwind passes by, the wicked _is_ no _more,_ But the righteous _has_ an everlasting foundation. 

###### 26 
As vinegar to the teeth and smoke to the eyes, So _is_ the lazy _man_ to those who send him. 

###### 27 
The fear of the Lord prolongs days, But the years of the wicked will be shortened. 

###### 28 
The hope of the righteous _will be_ gladness, But the expectation of the wicked will perish. 

###### 29 
The way of the Lord _is_ strength for the upright, But destruction _will come_ to the workers of iniquity. 

###### 30 
The righteous will never be removed, But the wicked will not inhabit the earth. 

###### 31 
The mouth of the righteous brings forth wisdom, But the perverse tongue will be cut out. 

###### 32 
The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable, But the mouth of the wicked _what is_ perverse.

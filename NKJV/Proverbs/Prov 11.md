# Proverbs 11

***


###### 1 
Dishonest[^a] scales _are_ an abomination to the Lord, But a [^b]just weight _is_ His delight. 

###### 2 
When pride comes, then comes shame; But with the humble _is_ wisdom. 

###### 3 
The integrity of the upright will guide them, But the perversity of the unfaithful will destroy them. 

###### 4 
Riches do not profit in the day of wrath, But righteousness delivers from death. 

###### 5 
The righteousness of the blameless will [^c]direct his way aright, But the wicked will fall by his own wickedness. 

###### 6 
The righteousness of the upright will deliver them, But the unfaithful will be caught by _their_ lust. 

###### 7 
When a wicked man dies, _his_ expectation will perish, And the hope of the unjust perishes. 

###### 8 
The righteous is delivered from trouble, And it comes to the wicked instead. 

###### 9 
The hypocrite with _his_ mouth destroys his neighbor, But through knowledge the righteous will be delivered. 

###### 10 
When it goes well with the righteous, the city rejoices; And when the wicked perish, _there is_ jubilation. 

###### 11 
By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted, But it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked. 

###### 12 
He who [^d]is devoid of wisdom despises his neighbor, But a man of understanding holds his peace. 

###### 13 
A talebearer reveals secrets, But he who is of a faithful spirit conceals a matter. 

###### 14 
Where _there is_ no counsel, the people fall; But in the multitude of counselors _there is_ safety. 

###### 15 
He who is surety[^e] for a stranger will suffer, But one who hates [^f]being surety is secure. 

###### 16 
A gracious woman retains honor, But ruthless _men_ retain riches. 

###### 17 
The merciful man does good for his own soul, But _he who is_ cruel troubles his own flesh. 

###### 18 
The wicked _man_ does deceptive work, But he who sows righteousness _will have_ a sure reward. 

###### 19 
As righteousness _leads_ to life, So he who pursues evil _pursues it_ to his own death. 

###### 20 
Those who are of a perverse heart _are_ an abomination to the Lord, But _the_ blameless in their ways _are_ His delight. 

###### 21 
_Though they join_ [^g]forces, the wicked will not go unpunished; But the posterity of the righteous will be delivered. 

###### 22 
_As_ a ring of gold in a swine's snout, _So is_ a lovely woman who lacks [^h]discretion. 

###### 23 
The desire of the righteous _is_ only good, _But_ the expectation of the wicked _is_ wrath. 

###### 24 
There is _one_ who scatters, yet increases more; And there is _one_ who withholds more than is right, But it _leads_ to poverty. 

###### 25 
The generous soul will be made rich, And he who waters will also be watered himself. 

###### 26 
The people will curse him who withholds grain, But blessing _will be_ on the head of him who sells _it._ 

###### 27 
He who earnestly seeks good [^i]finds favor, But trouble will come to him who seeks _evil._ 

###### 28 
He who trusts in his riches will fall, But the righteous will flourish like foliage. 

###### 29 
He who troubles his own house will inherit the wind, And the fool _will be_ servant to the wise of heart. 

###### 30 
The fruit of the righteous _is a_ tree of life, And he who [^j]wins souls _is_ wise. 

###### 31 
If the righteous will be [^k]recompensed on the earth, How much more the ungodly and the sinner.

# Proverbs 12

***


###### 1 
Whoever loves instruction loves knowledge, But he who hates correction _is_ stupid. 

###### 2 
A good _man_ obtains favor from the Lord, But a man of wicked intentions He will condemn. 

###### 3 
A man is not established by wickedness, But the root of the righteous cannot be moved. 

###### 4 
An[^a] excellent wife _is_ the crown of her husband, But she who causes shame _is_ like rottenness in his bones. 

###### 5 
The thoughts of the righteous _are_ right, _But_ the counsels of the wicked _are_ deceitful. 

###### 6 
The words of the wicked _are,_ "Lie in wait for blood," But the mouth of the upright will deliver them. 

###### 7 
The wicked are overthrown and _are_ no more, But the house of the righteous will stand. 

###### 8 
A man will be commended according to his wisdom, But he who is of a perverse heart will be despised. 

###### 9 
Better _is the one_ who is [^b]slighted but has a servant, Than he who honors himself but lacks bread. 

###### 10 
A righteous _man_ regards the life of his animal, But the tender mercies of the wicked _are_ cruel. 

###### 11 
He who [^c]tills his land will be satisfied with bread, But he who follows [^d]frivolity _is_ devoid of [^e]understanding. 

###### 12 
The wicked covet the catch of evil _men,_ But the root of the righteous yields _fruit._ 

###### 13 
The wicked is ensnared by the transgression of _his_ lips, But the righteous will come through trouble. 

###### 14 
A man will be satisfied with good by the fruit of _his_ mouth, And the recompense of a man's hands will be rendered to him. 

###### 15 
The way of a fool _is_ right in his own eyes, But he who heeds counsel _is_ wise. 

###### 16 
A fool's wrath is known at once, But a prudent _man_ covers shame. 

###### 17 
He _who_ speaks truth declares righteousness, But a false witness, deceit. 

###### 18 
There is one who speaks like the piercings of a sword, But the tongue of the wise _promotes_ health. 

###### 19 
The truthful lip shall be established forever, But a lying tongue _is_ but for a moment. 

###### 20 
Deceit is in the heart of those who devise evil, But counselors of peace have joy. 

###### 21 
No grave [^f]trouble will overtake the righteous, But the wicked shall be filled with evil. 

###### 22 
Lying lips _are_ an abomination to the Lord, But those who deal truthfully _are_ His delight. 

###### 23 
A prudent man conceals knowledge, But the heart of fools proclaims foolishness. 

###### 24 
The hand of the diligent will rule, But the lazy _man_ will be put to forced labor. 

###### 25 
Anxiety in the heart of man causes depression, But a good word makes it glad. 

###### 26 
The righteous should choose his friends carefully, For the way of the wicked leads them astray. 

###### 27 
The lazy _man_ does not roast what he took in hunting, But diligence _is_ man's precious possession. 

###### 28 
In the way of righteousness _is_ life, And in _its_ pathway _there is_ no death. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

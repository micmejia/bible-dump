# Proverbs 13

***


###### 1 
A wise son _heeds_ his father's instruction, But a scoffer does not listen to rebuke. 

###### 2 
A man shall eat well by the fruit of _his_ mouth, But the soul of the unfaithful feeds on violence. 

###### 3 
He who guards his mouth preserves his life, _But_ he who opens wide his lips shall have destruction. 

###### 4 
The soul of a lazy _man_ desires, and _has_ nothing; But the soul of the diligent shall be made rich. 

###### 5 
A righteous _man_ hates lying, But a wicked _man_ is loathsome and comes to shame. 

###### 6 
Righteousness guards _him whose_ way is blameless, But wickedness overthrows the sinner. 

###### 7 
There is one who makes himself rich, yet _has_ nothing; _And_ one who makes himself poor, yet _has_ great riches. 

###### 8 
The ransom of a man's life _is_ his riches, But the poor does not hear rebuke. 

###### 9 
The light of the righteous rejoices, But the lamp of the wicked will be put out. 

###### 10 
By pride comes nothing but strife, But with the well-advised _is_ wisdom. 

###### 11 
Wealth _gained by_ dishonesty will be diminished, But he who gathers by labor will increase. 

###### 12 
Hope deferred makes the heart sick, But _when_ the desire comes, _it is_ a tree of life. 

###### 13 
He who despises the word will be destroyed, But he who fears the commandment will be rewarded. 

###### 14 
The law of the wise _is_ a fountain of life, To turn _one_ away from the snares of death. 

###### 15 
Good understanding [^a]gains favor, But the way of the unfaithful _is_ hard. 

###### 16 
Every prudent _man_ acts with knowledge, But a fool lays open _his_ folly. 

###### 17 
A wicked messenger falls into trouble, But a faithful ambassador _brings_ health. 

###### 18 
Poverty and shame _will come_ to him who [^b]disdains correction, But he who regards a rebuke will be honored. 

###### 19 
A desire accomplished is sweet to the soul, But _it is_ an abomination to fools to depart from evil. 

###### 20 
He who walks with wise _men_ will be wise, But the companion of fools will be destroyed. 

###### 21 
Evil pursues sinners, But to the righteous, good shall be repaid. 

###### 22 
A good _man_ leaves an inheritance to his children's children, But the wealth of the sinner is stored up for the righteous. 

###### 23 
Much food _is in_ the [^c]fallow _ground_ of the poor, And for lack of justice there is [^d]waste. 

###### 24 
He who spares his rod hates his son, But he who loves him disciplines him [^e]promptly. 

###### 25 
The righteous eats to the satisfying of his soul, But the stomach of the wicked shall be in want.

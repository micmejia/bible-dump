# Proverbs 14

***


###### 1 
The wise woman builds her house, But the foolish pulls it down with her hands. 

###### 2 
He who walks in his uprightness fears the Lord, But _he who is_ perverse in his ways despises Him. 

###### 3 
In the mouth of a fool _is_ a rod of pride, But the lips of the wise will preserve them. 

###### 4 
Where no oxen _are,_ the trough _is_ clean; But much increase _comes_ by the strength of an ox. 

###### 5 
A faithful witness does not lie, But a false witness will utter lies. 

###### 6 
A scoffer seeks wisdom and does not _find it,_ But knowledge _is_ easy to him who understands. 

###### 7 
Go from the presence of a foolish man, When you do not perceive _in him_ the lips of knowledge. 

###### 8 
The wisdom of the prudent _is_ to understand his way, But the folly of fools _is_ deceit. 

###### 9 
Fools mock at sin, But among the upright _there is_ favor. 

###### 10 
The heart knows its own bitterness, And a stranger does not share its joy. 

###### 11 
The house of the wicked will be overthrown, But the tent of the upright will flourish. 

###### 12 
There is a way _that seems_ right to a man, But its end _is_ the way of death. 

###### 13 
Even in laughter the heart may sorrow, And the end of mirth _may be_ grief. 

###### 14 
The backslider in heart will be filled with his own ways, But a good man _will be satisfied_ from above. 

###### 15 
The simple believes every word, But the prudent considers well his steps. 

###### 16 
A wise _man_ fears and departs from evil, But a fool rages and is self-confident. 

###### 17 
A quick-tempered _man_ acts foolishly, And a man of wicked intentions is hated. 

###### 18 
The simple inherit folly, But the prudent are crowned with knowledge. 

###### 19 
The evil will bow before the good, And the wicked at the gates of the righteous. 

###### 20 
The poor _man_ is hated even by his own neighbor, But the rich _has_ many friends. 

###### 21 
He who despises his neighbor sins; But he who has mercy on the poor, happy _is_ he. 

###### 22 
Do they not go astray who devise evil? But mercy and truth _belong_ to those who devise good. 

###### 23 
In all labor there is profit, But idle chatter _leads_ only to poverty. 

###### 24 
The crown of the wise is their riches, _But_ the foolishness of fools _is_ folly. 

###### 25 
A true witness delivers souls, But a deceitful _witness_ speaks lies. 

###### 26 
In the fear of the Lord _there is_ strong confidence, And His children will have a place of refuge. 

###### 27 
The fear of the Lord _is_ a fountain of life, To turn _one_ away from the snares of death. 

###### 28 
In a multitude of people _is_ a king's honor, But in the lack of people _is_ the downfall of a prince. 

###### 29 
_He who is_ slow to wrath has great understanding, But _he who is_ impulsive exalts folly. 

###### 30 
A sound heart _is_ life to the body, But envy _is_ rottenness to the bones. 

###### 31 
He who oppresses the poor reproaches his Maker, But he who honors Him has mercy on the needy. 

###### 32 
The wicked is banished in his wickedness, But the righteous has a refuge in his death. 

###### 33 
Wisdom rests in the heart of him who has understanding, But _what is_ in the heart of fools is made known. 

###### 34 
Righteousness exalts a nation, But sin _is_ a reproach to _any_ people. 

###### 35 
The king's favor _is_ toward a wise servant, But his wrath _is against_ him who causes shame.

# Proverbs 15

***


###### 1 
A soft answer turns away wrath, But a harsh word stirs up anger. 

###### 2 
The tongue of the wise uses knowledge rightly, But the mouth of fools pours forth foolishness. 

###### 3 
The eyes of the Lord _are_ in every place, Keeping watch on the evil and the good. 

###### 4 
A wholesome tongue _is_ a tree of life, But perverseness in it breaks the spirit. 

###### 5 
A fool despises his father's instruction, But he who receives correction is prudent. 

###### 6 
_In_ the house of the righteous _there is_ much treasure, But in the revenue of the wicked is trouble. 

###### 7 
The lips of the wise disperse knowledge, But the heart of the fool _does_ not _do_ so. 

###### 8 
The sacrifice of the wicked _is_ an abomination to the Lord, But the prayer of the upright _is_ His delight. 

###### 9 
The way of the wicked _is_ an abomination to the Lord, But He loves him who follows righteousness. 

###### 10 
Harsh discipline _is_ for him who forsakes the way, _And_ he who hates correction will die. 

###### 11 
Hell and Destruction _are_ before the Lord; So how much more the hearts of the sons of men. 

###### 12 
A scoffer does not love one who corrects him, Nor will he go to the wise. 

###### 13 
A merry heart makes a cheerful countenance, But by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken. 

###### 14 
The heart of him who has understanding seeks knowledge, But the mouth of fools feeds on foolishness. 

###### 15 
All the days of the afflicted _are_ evil, But he who is of a merry heart _has_ a continual feast. 

###### 16 
Better _is_ a little with the fear of the Lord, Than great treasure with trouble. 

###### 17 
Better _is_ a dinner of herbs where love is, Than a fatted calf with hatred. 

###### 18 
A wrathful man stirs up strife, But _he who is_ slow to anger allays contention. 

###### 19 
The way of the lazy _man is_ like a hedge of thorns, But the way of the upright _is_ a highway. 

###### 20 
A wise son makes a father glad, But a foolish man despises his mother. 

###### 21 
Folly _is_ joy _to him who is_ destitute of discernment, But a man of understanding walks uprightly. 

###### 22 
Without counsel, plans go awry, But in the multitude of counselors they are established. 

###### 23 
A man has joy by the answer of his mouth, And a word _spoken_ in due season, how good _it is!_ 

###### 24 
The way of life _winds_ upward for the wise, That he may turn away from hell below. 

###### 25 
The Lord will destroy the house of the proud, But He will establish the boundary of the widow. 

###### 26 
The thoughts of the wicked _are_ an abomination to the Lord, But the words of the pure _are_ pleasant. 

###### 27 
He who is greedy for gain troubles his own house, But he who hates bribes will live. 

###### 28 
The heart of the righteous studies how to answer, But the mouth of the wicked pours forth evil. 

###### 29 
The Lord _is_ far from the wicked, But He hears the prayer of the righteous. 

###### 30 
The light of the eyes rejoices the heart, _And_ a good report makes the bones healthy. 

###### 31 
The ear that hears the rebukes of life Will abide among the wise. 

###### 32 
He who disdains instruction despises his own soul, But he who heeds rebuke gets understanding. 

###### 33 
The fear of the Lord _is_ the instruction of wisdom, And before honor _is_ humility.

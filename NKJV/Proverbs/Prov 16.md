# Proverbs 16

***


###### 1 
The preparations[^a] of the heart _belong_ to man, But the answer of the tongue _is_ from the Lord. 

###### 2 
All the ways of a man _are_ pure in his own eyes, But the Lord weighs the spirits. 

###### 3 
Commit[^b] your works to the Lord, And your thoughts will be established. 

###### 4 
The Lord has made all for Himself, Yes, even the wicked for the day of [^c]doom. 

###### 5 
Everyone proud in heart _is_ an abomination to the Lord; _Though they join_ [^d]forces, none will go unpunished. 

###### 6 
In mercy and truth Atonement is provided for iniquity; And by the fear of the Lord _one_ departs from evil. 

###### 7 
When a man's ways please the Lord, He makes even his enemies to be at peace with him. 

###### 8 
Better _is_ a little with righteousness, Than vast revenues without justice. 

###### 9 
A man's heart plans his way, But the Lord directs his steps. 

###### 10 
Divination _is_ on the lips of the king; His mouth must not transgress in judgment. 

###### 11 
Honest weights and scales _are_ the Lord's; All the weights in the bag _are_ His [^e]work. 

###### 12 
_It is_ an abomination for kings to commit wickedness, For a throne is established by righteousness. 

###### 13 
Righteous lips _are_ the delight of kings, And they love him who speaks _what is_ right. 

###### 14 
As messengers of death _is_ the king's wrath, But a wise man will appease it. 

###### 15 
In the light of the king's face _is_ life, And his favor _is_ like a cloud of the latter rain. 

###### 16 
How much better to get wisdom than gold! And to get understanding is to be chosen rather than silver. 

###### 17 
The highway of the upright _is_ to depart from evil; He who keeps his way preserves his soul. 

###### 18 
Pride _goes_ before destruction, And a haughty spirit before [^f]a fall. 

###### 19 
Better _to be_ of a humble spirit with the lowly, Than to divide the [^g]spoil with the proud. 

###### 20 
He who heeds the word wisely will find good, And whoever trusts in the Lord, happy _is_ he. 

###### 21 
The wise in heart will be called prudent, And sweetness of the lips increases learning. 

###### 22 
Understanding _is_ a wellspring of life to him who has it. But the correction of fools _is_ folly. 

###### 23 
The heart of the wise teaches his mouth, And adds learning to his lips. 

###### 24 
Pleasant words _are like_ a honeycomb, Sweetness to the soul and health to the bones. 

###### 25 
There is a way _that seems_ right to a man, But its end _is_ the way of death. 

###### 26 
The person who labors, labors for himself, For his _hungry_ mouth drives him _on._ 

###### 27 
[^h]An ungodly man digs up evil, And _it is_ on his lips like a burning fire. 

###### 28 
A perverse man sows strife, And a whisperer separates the best of friends. 

###### 29 
A violent man entices his neighbor, And leads him in a way _that is_ not good. 

###### 30 
He winks his eye to devise perverse things; He [^i]purses his lips _and_ brings about evil. 

###### 31 
The silver-haired head _is_ a crown of glory, _If_ it is found in the way of righteousness. 

###### 32 
_He who is_ slow to anger _is_ better than the mighty, And he who rules his spirit than he who takes a city. 

###### 33 
The lot is cast into the lap, But its every decision _is_ from the Lord.

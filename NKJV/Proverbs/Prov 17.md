# Proverbs 17

***


###### 1 
Better _is_ a dry morsel with quietness, Than a house full of [^a]feasting _with_ strife. 

###### 2 
A wise servant will rule over a son who causes shame, And will share an inheritance among the brothers. 

###### 3 
The refining pot _is_ for silver and the furnace for gold, But the Lord tests the hearts. 

###### 4 
An evildoer gives heed to false lips; A liar listens eagerly to a [^b]spiteful tongue. 

###### 5 
He who mocks the poor reproaches his Maker; He who is glad at calamity will not go unpunished. 

###### 6 
Children's children _are_ the crown of old men, And the glory of children _is_ their father. 

###### 7 
Excellent speech is not becoming to a fool, Much less lying lips to a prince. 

###### 8 
A present _is_ a precious stone in the eyes of its possessor; Wherever he turns, he prospers. 

###### 9 
He who covers a transgression seeks love, But he who repeats a matter separates friends. 

###### 10 
Rebuke is more effective for a wise _man_ Than a hundred blows on a fool. 

###### 11 
An evil _man_ seeks only rebellion; Therefore a cruel messenger will be sent against him. 

###### 12 
Let a man meet a bear robbed of her cubs, Rather than a fool in his folly. 

###### 13 
Whoever rewards evil for good, Evil will not depart from his house. 

###### 14 
The beginning of strife _is like_ releasing water; Therefore stop contention before a quarrel starts. 

###### 15 
He who justifies the wicked, and he who condemns the just, Both of them alike _are_ an abomination to the Lord. 

###### 16 
Why _is there_ in the hand of a fool the purchase price of wisdom, Since _he has_ no heart _for it?_ 

###### 17 
A friend loves at all times, And a brother is born for adversity. 

###### 18 
A man devoid of [^c]understanding [^d]shakes hands in a pledge, _And_ becomes [^e]surety for his friend. 

###### 19 
He who loves transgression loves strife, And he who exalts his gate seeks destruction. 

###### 20 
He who has a [^f]deceitful heart finds no good, And he who has a perverse tongue falls into evil. 

###### 21 
He who begets a scoffer _does so_ to his sorrow, And the father of a fool has no joy. 

###### 22 
A merry heart [^g]does good, _like_ medicine, But a broken spirit dries the bones. 

###### 23 
A wicked _man_ accepts a bribe [^h]behind the back To pervert the ways of justice. 

###### 24 
Wisdom _is_ in the sight of him who has understanding, But the eyes of a fool _are_ on the ends of the earth. 

###### 25 
A foolish son _is_ a grief to his father, And bitterness to her who bore him. 

###### 26 
Also, to punish the righteous _is_ not good, _Nor_ to strike princes for _their_ uprightness. 

###### 27 
He who has knowledge spares his words, _And_ a man of understanding is of a calm spirit. 

###### 28 
Even a fool is counted wise when he holds his peace; _When_ he shuts his lips, _he is considered_ perceptive. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

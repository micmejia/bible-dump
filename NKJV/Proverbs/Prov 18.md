# Proverbs 18

***


###### 1 
A man who isolates himself seeks his own desire; He rages against all wise judgment. 

###### 2 
A fool has no delight in understanding, But in expressing his own heart. 

###### 3 
When the wicked comes, contempt comes also; And with dishonor _comes_ reproach. 

###### 4 
The words of a man's mouth _are_ deep waters; The wellspring of wisdom _is_ a flowing brook. 

###### 5 
_It is_ not good to show partiality to the wicked, _Or_ to overthrow the righteous in judgment. 

###### 6 
A fool's lips enter into contention, And his mouth calls for blows. 

###### 7 
A fool's mouth _is_ his destruction, And his lips _are_ the snare of his soul. 

###### 8 
The words of a talebearer _are_ like tasty trifles, And they go down into the inmost body. 

###### 9 
He who is slothful in his work Is a brother to him who is a great destroyer. 

###### 10 
The name of the Lord _is_ a strong tower; The righteous run to it and are safe. 

###### 11 
The rich man's wealth _is_ his strong city, And like a high wall in his own esteem. 

###### 12 
Before destruction the heart of a man is haughty, And before honor _is_ humility. 

###### 13 
He who answers a matter before he hears _it,_ It _is_ folly and shame to him. 

###### 14 
The spirit of a man will sustain him in sickness, But who can bear a broken spirit? 

###### 15 
The heart of the prudent acquires knowledge, And the ear of the wise seeks knowledge. 

###### 16 
A man's gift makes room for him, And brings him before great men. 

###### 17 
The first _one_ to plead his cause _seems_ right, Until his neighbor comes and examines him. 

###### 18 
Casting lots causes contentions to cease, And keeps the mighty apart. 

###### 19 
A brother offended _is harder to win_ than a strong city, And contentions _are_ like the bars of a castle. 

###### 20 
A man's stomach shall be satisfied from the fruit of his mouth; _From_ the produce of his lips he shall be filled. 

###### 21 
Death and life _are_ in the power of the tongue, And those who love it will eat its fruit. 

###### 22 
_He who_ finds a wife finds a good _thing,_ And obtains favor from the Lord. 

###### 23 
The poor _man_ uses entreaties, But the rich answers roughly. 

###### 24 
A man _who has_ friends must himself be friendly, But there is a friend _who_ sticks closer than a brother.

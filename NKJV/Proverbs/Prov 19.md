# Proverbs 19

***


###### 1 
Better _is_ the poor who walks in his integrity Than _one who is_ perverse in his lips, and is a fool. 

###### 2 
Also it is not good _for_ a soul _to be_ without knowledge, And he sins who hastens with _his_ feet. 

###### 3 
The foolishness of a man twists his way, And his heart frets against the Lord. 

###### 4 
Wealth makes many friends, But the poor is separated from his friend. 

###### 5 
A false witness will not go unpunished, And _he who_ speaks lies will not escape. 

###### 6 
Many entreat the favor of the nobility, And every man _is_ a friend to one who gives gifts. 

###### 7 
All the brothers of the poor hate him; How much more do his friends go far from him! He may pursue _them with_ words, _yet_ they abandon _him._ 

###### 8 
He who gets wisdom loves his own soul; He who keeps understanding will find good. 

###### 9 
A false witness will not go unpunished, And _he who_ speaks lies shall perish. 

###### 10 
Luxury is not fitting for a fool, Much less for a servant to rule over princes. 

###### 11 
The discretion of a man makes him slow to anger, And his glory _is_ to overlook a transgression. 

###### 12 
The king's wrath _is_ like the roaring of a lion, But his favor _is_ like dew on the grass. 

###### 13 
A foolish son _is_ the ruin of his father, And the contentions of a wife _are_ a continual dripping. 

###### 14 
Houses and riches _are_ an inheritance from fathers, But a prudent wife _is_ from the Lord. 

###### 15 
Laziness casts _one_ into a deep sleep, And an idle person will suffer hunger. 

###### 16 
He who keeps the commandment keeps his soul, _But_ he who is careless of his ways will die. 

###### 17 
He who has pity on the poor lends to the Lord, And He will pay back what he has given. 

###### 18 
Chasten your son while there is hope, And do not set your heart on his destruction. 

###### 19 
_A man of_ great wrath will suffer punishment; For if you rescue _him,_ you will have to do it again. 

###### 20 
Listen to counsel and receive instruction, That you may be wise in your latter days. 

###### 21 
There are many plans in a man's heart, Nevertheless the Lord's counsel--that will stand. 

###### 22 
What is desired in a man is kindness, And a poor man is better than a liar. 

###### 23 
The fear of the Lord _leads_ to life, And _he who has it_ will abide in satisfaction; He will not be visited with evil. 

###### 24 
A lazy _man_ buries his hand in the bowl, And will not so much as bring it to his mouth again. 

###### 25 
Strike a scoffer, and the simple will become wary; Rebuke one who has understanding, _and_ he will discern knowledge. 

###### 26 
He who mistreats _his_ father _and_ chases away _his_ mother _Is_ a son who causes shame and brings reproach. 

###### 27 
Cease listening to instruction, my son, And you will stray from the words of knowledge. 

###### 28 
A disreputable witness scorns justice, And the mouth of the wicked devours iniquity. 

###### 29 
Judgments are prepared for scoffers, And beatings for the backs of fools.

# Proverbs 2

***


###### 1 
My son, if you receive my words, And treasure my commands within you, 

###### 2 
So that you incline your ear to wisdom, _And_ apply your heart to understanding; 

###### 3 
Yes, if you cry out for discernment, _And_ lift up your voice for understanding, 

###### 4 
If you seek her as silver, And search for her as _for_ hidden treasures; 

###### 5 
Then you will understand the fear of the Lord, And find the knowledge of God. 

###### 6 
For the Lord gives wisdom; From His mouth _come_ knowledge and understanding; 

###### 7 
He stores up sound wisdom for the upright; _He is_ a shield to those who walk uprightly; 

###### 8 
He guards the paths of justice, And preserves the way of His saints. 

###### 9 
Then you will understand righteousness and justice, Equity _and_ every good path. 

###### 10 
When wisdom enters your heart, And knowledge is pleasant to your soul, 

###### 11 
Discretion will preserve you; Understanding will keep you, 

###### 12 
To deliver you from the way of evil, From the man who speaks perverse things, 

###### 13 
From those who leave the paths of uprightness To walk in the ways of darkness; 

###### 14 
Who rejoice in doing evil, _And_ delight in the perversity of the wicked; 

###### 15 
Whose ways _are_ crooked, And _who are_ devious in their paths; 

###### 16 
To deliver you from the immoral woman, From the seductress _who_ flatters with her words, 

###### 17 
Who forsakes the companion of her youth, And forgets the covenant of her God. 

###### 18 
For her house leads down to death, And her paths to the dead; 

###### 19 
None who go to her return, Nor do they regain the paths of life-- 

###### 20 
So you may walk in the way of goodness, And keep _to_ the paths of righteousness. 

###### 21 
For the upright will dwell in the land, And the blameless will remain in it; 

###### 22 
But the wicked will be cut off from the earth, And the unfaithful will be uprooted from it.

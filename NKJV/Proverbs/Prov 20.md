# Proverbs 20

***


###### 1 
Wine _is_ a mocker, Strong drink _is_ a brawler, And whoever is led astray by it is not wise. 

###### 2 
The [^a]wrath of a king _is_ like the roaring of a lion; _Whoever_ provokes him to anger sins _against_ his own life. 

###### 3 
_It is_ honorable for a man to stop striving, Since any fool can start a quarrel. 

###### 4 
The lazy _man_ will not plow because of winter; He will beg during harvest and _have_ nothing. 

###### 5 
Counsel in the heart of man _is like_ deep water, But a man of understanding will draw it out. 

###### 6 
Most men will proclaim each his own [^b]goodness, But who can find a faithful man? 

###### 7 
The righteous _man_ walks in his integrity; His children _are_ blessed after him. 

###### 8 
A king who sits on the throne of judgment Scatters all evil with his eyes. 

###### 9 
Who can say, "I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin"? 

###### 10 
Diverse weights _and_ diverse measures, They _are_ both alike, an abomination to the Lord. 

###### 11 
Even a child is known by his deeds, Whether what he does _is_ pure and right. 

###### 12 
The hearing ear and the seeing eye, The Lord has made them both. 

###### 13 
Do not love sleep, lest you come to poverty; Open your eyes, _and_ you will be satisfied with bread. 

###### 14 
"_It is_ [^c]good for nothing," cries the buyer; But when he has gone his way, then he boasts. 

###### 15 
There is gold and a multitude of rubies, But the lips of knowledge _are_ a precious jewel. 

###### 16 
Take the garment of one who is surety _for_ a stranger, And hold it as a pledge _when it_ is for a seductress. 

###### 17 
Bread gained by deceit _is_ sweet to a man, But afterward his mouth will be filled with gravel. 

###### 18 
Plans are established by counsel; By wise counsel wage war. 

###### 19 
He who goes about _as_ a talebearer reveals secrets; Therefore do not associate with one who flatters with his lips. 

###### 20 
Whoever curses his father or his mother, His lamp will be put out in deep darkness. 

###### 21 
An inheritance gained hastily at the beginning Will not be blessed at the end. 

###### 22 
Do not say, "I will [^d]recompense evil"; Wait for the Lord, and He will save you. 

###### 23 
Diverse weights _are_ an abomination to the Lord, And dishonest scales _are_ not good. 

###### 24 
A man's steps _are_ of the Lord; How then can a man understand his own way? 

###### 25 
_It is_ a snare for a man to devote rashly _something as_ holy, And afterward to reconsider _his_ vows. 

###### 26 
A wise king sifts out the wicked, And brings the threshing wheel over them. 

###### 27 
The spirit of a man _is_ the lamp of the Lord, Searching all the [^e]inner depths of his heart. 

###### 28 
Mercy and truth preserve the king, And by [^f]lovingkindness he upholds his throne. 

###### 29 
The glory of young men _is_ their strength, And the splendor of old men _is_ their gray head. 

###### 30 
Blows that hurt cleanse away evil, As _do_ stripes the [^g]inner depths of the heart.

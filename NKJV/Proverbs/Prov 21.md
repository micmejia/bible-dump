# Proverbs 21

***


###### 1 
The king's heart _is_ in the hand of the Lord, _Like_ the [^a]rivers of water; He turns it wherever He wishes. 

###### 2 
Every way of a man _is_ right in his own eyes, But the Lord weighs the hearts. 

###### 3 
To do righteousness and justice _Is_ more acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice. 

###### 4 
A haughty look, a proud heart, _And_ the [^b]plowing of the wicked _are_ sin. 

###### 5 
The plans of the diligent _lead_ surely to plenty, But _those of_ everyone _who is_ hasty, surely to poverty. 

###### 6 
Getting treasures by a lying tongue [^c]_Is_ the fleeting fantasy of those who seek death. 

###### 7 
The violence of the wicked will [^d]destroy them, Because they refuse to do justice. 

###### 8 
The way of [^e]a guilty man _is_ perverse; But _as for_ the pure, his work _is_ right. 

###### 9 
Better to dwell in a corner of a housetop, Than in a house shared with a contentious woman. 

###### 10 
The soul of the wicked desires evil; His neighbor finds no favor in his eyes. 

###### 11 
When the scoffer is punished, the simple is made wise; But when the wise is instructed, he receives knowledge. 

###### 12 
The righteous _God_ wisely considers the house of the wicked, Overthrowing the wicked for _their_ wickedness. 

###### 13 
Whoever shuts his ears to the cry of the poor Will also cry himself and not be heard. 

###### 14 
A gift in secret pacifies anger, And a bribe [^f]behind the back, strong wrath. 

###### 15 
_It is_ a joy for the just to do justice, But destruction _will come_ to the workers of iniquity. 

###### 16 
A man who wanders from the way of understanding Will rest in the assembly of the dead. 

###### 17 
He who loves pleasure _will be_ a poor man; He who loves wine and oil will not be rich. 

###### 18 
The wicked _shall be_ a ransom for the righteous, And the unfaithful for the upright. 

###### 19 
Better to dwell [^g]in the wilderness, Than with a contentious and angry woman. 

###### 20 
_There is_ desirable treasure, And oil in the dwelling of the wise, But a foolish man squanders it. 

###### 21 
He who follows righteousness and mercy Finds life, righteousness, and honor. 

###### 22 
A wise _man_ [^h]scales the city of the mighty, And brings down the trusted stronghold. 

###### 23 
Whoever guards his mouth and tongue Keeps his soul from troubles. 

###### 24 
A proud _and_ haughty _man_--"Scoffer" _is_ his name; He acts with arrogant pride. 

###### 25 
The desire of the lazy _man_ kills him, For his hands refuse to labor. 

###### 26 
He covets greedily all day long, But the righteous gives and does not spare. 

###### 27 
The sacrifice of the wicked _is_ an abomination; How much more _when_ he brings it with wicked intent! 

###### 28 
A false witness shall perish, But the man who hears _him_ will speak endlessly. 

###### 29 
A wicked man hardens his face, But _as for_ the upright, he [^i]establishes his way. 

###### 30 
_There is_ no wisdom or understanding Or counsel against the Lord. 

###### 31 
The horse _is_ prepared for the day of battle, But deliverance _is_ of the Lord. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

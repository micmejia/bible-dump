# Proverbs 22

***


###### 1 
A _good_ name is to be chosen rather than great riches, Loving favor rather than silver and gold. 

###### 2 
The rich and the poor have this in common, The Lord _is_ the maker of them all. 

###### 3 
A prudent _man_ foresees evil and hides himself, But the simple pass on and are punished. 

###### 4 
By humility _and_ the fear of the Lord _Are_ riches and honor and life. 

###### 5 
Thorns _and_ snares _are_ in the way of the perverse; He who guards his soul will be far from them. 

###### 6 
Train up a child in the way he should go, [^a]And when he is old he will not depart from it. 

###### 7 
The rich rules over the poor, And the borrower _is_ servant to the lender. 

###### 8 
He who sows iniquity will reap sorrow,[^b] And the rod of his anger will fail. 

###### 9 
He who has a [^c]generous eye will be blessed, For he gives of his bread to the poor. 

###### 10 
Cast out the scoffer, and contention will leave; Yes, strife and reproach will cease. 

###### 11 
He who loves purity of heart _And has_ grace on his lips, The king _will be_ his friend. 

###### 12 
The eyes of the Lord preserve knowledge, But He overthrows the words of the faithless. 

###### 13 
The lazy _man_ says, "_There is_ a lion outside! I shall be slain in the streets!" 

###### 14 
The mouth of an immoral woman _is_ a deep pit; He who is abhorred by the Lord will fall there. 

###### 15 
Foolishness _is_ bound up in the heart of a child; The rod of correction will drive it far from him. 

###### 16 
He who oppresses the poor to increase his _riches,_ _And_ he who gives to the rich, _will_ surely _come_ to poverty. ## Sayings of the Wise 

###### 17 
Incline your ear and hear the words of the wise, And apply your heart to my knowledge; 

###### 18 
For _it is_ a pleasant thing if you keep them within you; Let them all be fixed upon your lips, 

###### 19 
So that your trust may be in the Lord; I have instructed you today, even you. 

###### 20 
Have I not written to you excellent things Of counsels and knowledge, 

###### 21 
That I may make you know the certainty of the words of truth, That you may answer words of truth To those who [^d]send to you? 

###### 22 
Do not rob the poor because he _is_ poor, Nor oppress the afflicted at the gate; 

###### 23 
For the Lord will plead their cause, And plunder the soul of those who plunder them. 

###### 24 
Make no friendship with an angry man, And with a furious man do not go, 

###### 25 
Lest you learn his ways And set a snare for your soul. 

###### 26 
Do not be one of those who [^e]shakes hands in a pledge, One of those who is [^f]surety for debts; 

###### 27 
If you have nothing _with which_ to pay, Why should he take away your bed from under you? 

###### 28 
Do not remove the ancient [^g]landmark Which your fathers have set. 

###### 29 
Do you see a man _who_ [^h]excels in his work? He will stand before kings; He will not stand before [^i]unknown _men._

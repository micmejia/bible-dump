# Proverbs 23

***


###### 1 
When you sit down to eat with a ruler, Consider carefully what _is_ before you; 

###### 2 
And put a knife to your throat If you _are_ a man given to appetite. 

###### 3 
Do not desire his delicacies, For they _are_ deceptive food. 

###### 4 
Do not overwork to be rich; Because of your own understanding, cease! 

###### 5 
[^a]Will you set your eyes on that which is not? For _riches_ certainly make themselves wings; They fly away like an eagle _toward_ heaven. 

###### 6 
Do not eat the bread of a[^b] miser, Nor desire his delicacies; 

###### 7 
For as he thinks in his heart, so _is_ he. "Eat and drink!" he says to you, But his heart is not with you. 

###### 8 
The morsel you have eaten, you will vomit up, And waste your pleasant words. 

###### 9 
Do not speak in the hearing of a fool, For he will despise the wisdom of your words. 

###### 10 
Do not remove the ancient [^c]landmark, Nor enter the fields of the fatherless; 

###### 11 
For their Redeemer _is_ mighty; He will plead their cause against you. 

###### 12 
Apply your heart to instruction, And your ears to words of knowledge. 

###### 13 
Do not withhold correction from a child, For _if_ you beat him with a rod, he will not die. 

###### 14 
You shall beat him with a rod, And deliver his soul from [^d]hell. 

###### 15 
My son, if your heart is wise, My heart will rejoice--indeed, I myself; 

###### 16 
Yes, my [^e]inmost being will rejoice When your lips speak right things. 

###### 17 
Do not let your heart envy sinners, But _be zealous_ for the fear of the Lord all the day; 

###### 18 
For surely there is a [^f]hereafter, And your hope will not be cut off. 

###### 19 
Hear, my son, and be wise; And guide your heart in the way. 

###### 20 
Do not mix with winebibbers, _Or_ with gluttonous eaters of meat; 

###### 21 
For the drunkard and the glutton will come to poverty, And drowsiness will clothe _a man_ with rags. 

###### 22 
Listen to your father who begot you, And do not despise your mother when she is old. 

###### 23 
Buy the truth, and do not sell _it,_ _Also_ wisdom and instruction and understanding. 

###### 24 
The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice, And he who begets a wise _child_ will delight in him. 

###### 25 
Let your father and your mother be glad, And let her who bore you rejoice. 

###### 26 
My son, give me your heart, And let your eyes observe my ways. 

###### 27 
For a harlot _is_ a deep pit, And a seductress _is_ a narrow well. 

###### 28 
She also lies in wait as _for_ a victim, And increases the unfaithful among men. 

###### 29 
Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has contentions? Who has complaints? Who has wounds without cause? Who has redness of eyes? 

###### 30 
Those who linger long at the wine, Those who go in search of mixed wine. 

###### 31 
Do not look on the wine when it is red, When it sparkles in the cup, _When_ it [^g]swirls around smoothly; 

###### 32 
At the last it bites like a serpent, And stings like a viper. 

###### 33 
Your eyes will see strange things, And your heart will utter perverse things. 

###### 34 
Yes, you will be like one who lies down in the [^h]midst of the sea, Or like one who lies at the top of the mast, _saying:_ 

###### 35 
"They have struck me, _but_ I was not hurt; They have beaten me, but I did not feel _it._ When shall I awake, that I may seek another _drink?_"

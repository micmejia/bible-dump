# Proverbs 24

***


###### 1 
Do not be envious of evil men, Nor desire to be with them; 

###### 2 
For their heart devises violence, And their lips talk of troublemaking. 

###### 3 
Through wisdom a house is built, And by understanding it is established; 

###### 4 
By knowledge the rooms are filled With all precious and pleasant riches. 

###### 5 
A wise man _is_ strong, Yes, a man of knowledge increases strength; 

###### 6 
For by wise counsel you will wage your own war, And in a multitude of counselors _there is_ safety. 

###### 7 
Wisdom _is_ too lofty for a fool; He does not open his mouth in the gate. 

###### 8 
He who plots to do evil Will be called a [^a]schemer. 

###### 9 
The devising of foolishness _is_ sin, And the scoffer _is_ an abomination to men. 

###### 10 
_If_ you faint in the day of adversity, Your strength _is_ small. 

###### 11 
Deliver _those who_ are drawn toward death, And hold back _those_ stumbling to the slaughter. 

###### 12 
If you say, "Surely we did not know this," Does not He who weighs the hearts consider _it?_ He who keeps your soul, does He _not_ know _it?_ And will He _not_ render to _each_ man according to his deeds? 

###### 13 
My son, eat honey because _it is_ good, And the honeycomb _which is_ sweet to your taste; 

###### 14 
So _shall_ the knowledge of wisdom _be_ to your soul; If you have found _it,_ there is a [^b]prospect, And your hope will not be cut off. 

###### 15 
Do not lie in wait, O wicked _man,_ against the dwelling of the righteous; Do not plunder his resting place; 

###### 16 
For a righteous _man_ may fall seven times And rise again, But the wicked shall fall by calamity. 

###### 17 
Do not rejoice when your enemy falls, And do not let your heart be glad when he stumbles; 

###### 18 
Lest the Lord see _it,_ and [^c]it displease Him, And He turn away His wrath from him. 

###### 19 
Do not fret because of evildoers, Nor be envious of the wicked; 

###### 20 
For there will be no prospect for the evil _man;_ The lamp of the wicked will be put out. 

###### 21 
My son, fear the Lord and the king; Do not associate with those given to change; 

###### 22 
For their calamity will rise suddenly, And who knows the ruin those two can bring? ## Further Sayings of the Wise 

###### 23 
These _things_ also _belong_ to the wise: _It is_ not good to [^d]show partiality in judgment. 

###### 24 
He who says to the wicked, "You _are_ righteous," Him the people will curse; Nations will abhor him. 

###### 25 
But those who rebuke _the wicked_ will have delight, And a good blessing will come upon them. 

###### 26 
He who gives a right answer kisses the lips. 

###### 27 
Prepare your outside work, Make it fit for yourself in the field; And afterward build your house. 

###### 28 
Do not be a witness against your neighbor without cause, [^e]For would you deceive with your lips? 

###### 29 
Do not say, "I will do to him just as he has done to me; I will render to the man according to his work." 

###### 30 
I went by the field of the lazy _man_, And by the vineyard of the man devoid of understanding; 

###### 31 
And there it was, all overgrown with thorns; Its surface was covered with nettles; Its stone wall was broken down. 

###### 32 
When I saw _it,_ I considered _it_ well; I looked on _it and_ received instruction: 

###### 33 
A little sleep, a little slumber, A little folding of the hands to rest; 

###### 34 
So shall your poverty come _like_ [^f]a prowler, And your need like [^g]an armed man. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

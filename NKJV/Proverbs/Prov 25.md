# Proverbs 25

***


###### 1 
These also _are_ proverbs of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied: 

###### 2 
_It is_ the glory of God to conceal a matter, But the glory of kings _is_ to search out a matter. 

###### 3 
_As_ the heavens for height and the earth for depth, So the heart of kings _is_ unsearchable. 

###### 4 
Take away the dross from silver, And it will go to the silversmith _for_ jewelry. 

###### 5 
Take away the wicked from before the king, And his throne will be established in righteousness. 

###### 6 
Do not exalt yourself in the presence of the king, And do not stand in the place of the great; 

###### 7 
For _it is_ better that he say to you, "Come up here," Than that you should be put lower in the presence of the prince, Whom your eyes have seen. 

###### 8 
Do not go hastily to court; For what will you do in the end, When your neighbor has put you to shame? 

###### 9 
Debate your case with your neighbor, And do not disclose the secret to another; 

###### 10 
Lest he who hears _it_ expose your shame, And your reputation be ruined. 

###### 11 
A word fitly spoken _is like_ apples of gold In settings of silver. 

###### 12 
_Like_ an earring of gold and an ornament of fine gold _Is_ a wise rebuker to an obedient ear. 

###### 13 
Like the cold of snow in time of harvest _Is_ a faithful messenger to those who send him, For he refreshes the soul of his masters. 

###### 14 
Whoever falsely boasts of giving _Is like_ clouds and wind without rain. 

###### 15 
By long forbearance a ruler is persuaded, And a gentle tongue breaks a bone. 

###### 16 
Have you found honey? Eat only as much as you need, Lest you be filled with it and vomit. 

###### 17 
Seldom set foot in your neighbor's house, Lest he become weary of you and hate you. 

###### 18 
A man who bears false witness against his neighbor _Is like_ a club, a sword, and a sharp arrow. 

###### 19 
Confidence in an unfaithful _man_ in time of trouble _Is like_ a bad tooth and a foot out of joint. 

###### 20 
_Like_ one who takes away a garment in cold weather, _And like_ vinegar on soda, _Is_ one who sings songs to a heavy heart. 

###### 21 
If your enemy is hungry, give him bread to eat; And if he is thirsty, give him water to drink; 

###### 22 
For _so_ you will heap coals of fire on his head, And the Lord will reward you. 

###### 23 
The north wind brings forth rain, And a backbiting tongue an angry countenance. 

###### 24 
_It is_ better to dwell in a corner of a housetop, Than in a house shared with a contentious woman. 

###### 25 
_As_ cold water to a weary soul, So _is_ good news from a far country. 

###### 26 
A righteous _man_ who falters before the wicked _Is like_ a murky spring and a polluted well. 

###### 27 
_It is_ not good to eat much honey; So to seek one's own glory _is not_ glory. 

###### 28 
Whoever _has_ no rule over his own spirit _Is like_ a city broken down, without walls.

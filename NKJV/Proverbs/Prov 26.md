# Proverbs 26

***


###### 1 
As snow in summer and rain in harvest, So honor is not fitting for a fool. 

###### 2 
Like a flitting sparrow, like a flying swallow, So a curse without cause shall not alight. 

###### 3 
A whip for the horse, A bridle for the donkey, And a rod for the fool's back. 

###### 4 
Do not answer a fool according to his folly, Lest you also be like him. 

###### 5 
Answer a fool according to his folly, Lest he be wise in his own eyes. 

###### 6 
He who sends a message by the hand of a fool Cuts off _his own_ feet _and_ drinks violence. 

###### 7 
_Like_ the legs of the lame that hang limp _Is_ a proverb in the mouth of fools. 

###### 8 
Like one who binds a stone in a sling _Is_ he who gives honor to a fool. 

###### 9 
_Like_ a thorn _that_ goes into the hand of a drunkard _Is_ a proverb in the mouth of fools. 

###### 10 
[^a]The great _God_ who formed everything Gives the fool _his_ hire and the transgressor _his_ wages. 

###### 11 
As a dog returns to his own vomit, _So_ a fool repeats his folly. 

###### 12 
Do you see a man wise in his own eyes? _There is_ more hope for a fool than for him. 

###### 13 
The lazy _man_ says, "_There is_ a lion in the road! A fierce lion _is_ in the [^b]streets!" 

###### 14 
_As_ a door turns on its hinges, So _does_ the lazy _man_ on his bed. 

###### 15 
The lazy _man_ buries his hand in the [^c]bowl; It wearies him to bring it back to his mouth. 

###### 16 
The lazy _man is_ wiser in his own eyes Than seven men who can answer sensibly. 

###### 17 
He who passes by _and_ meddles in a quarrel not his own _Is like_ one who takes a dog by the ears. 

###### 18 
Like a madman who throws firebrands, arrows, and death, 

###### 19 
_Is_ the man _who_ deceives his neighbor, And says, "I was only joking!" 

###### 20 
Where _there is_ no wood, the fire goes out; And where _there is_ no [^d]talebearer, strife ceases. 

###### 21 
_As_ charcoal _is_ to burning coals, and wood to fire, So _is_ a contentious man to kindle strife. 

###### 22 
The words of a [^e]talebearer _are_ like [^f]tasty trifles, And they go down into the [^g]inmost body. 

###### 23 
Fervent lips with a wicked heart _Are like_ earthenware covered with silver dross. 

###### 24 
He who hates, disguises _it_ with his lips, And lays up deceit within himself; 

###### 25 
When [^h]he speaks kindly, do not believe him, For _there are_ seven abominations in his heart; 

###### 26 
_Though his_ hatred is covered by deceit, His wickedness will be revealed before the assembly. 

###### 27 
Whoever digs a pit will fall into it, And he who rolls a stone will have it roll back on him. 

###### 28 
A lying tongue hates _those who are_ crushed by it, And a flattering mouth works ruin.

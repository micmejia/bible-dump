# Proverbs 27

***


###### 1 
Do not boast about tomorrow, For you do not know what a day may bring forth. 

###### 2 
Let another man praise you, and not your own mouth; A stranger, and not your own lips. 

###### 3 
A stone _is_ heavy and sand _is_ weighty, But a fool's wrath _is_ heavier than both of them. 

###### 4 
Wrath _is_ cruel and anger a torrent, But who _is_ able to stand before jealousy? 

###### 5 
Open rebuke _is_ better Than love carefully concealed. 

###### 6 
Faithful _are_ the wounds of a friend, But the kisses of an enemy _are_ deceitful. 

###### 7 
A satisfied soul [^a]loathes the honeycomb, But to a hungry soul every bitter thing _is_ sweet. 

###### 8 
Like a bird that wanders from its nest _Is_ a man who wanders from his place. 

###### 9 
Ointment and perfume delight the heart, And the sweetness of a man's friend _gives delight_ by [^b]hearty counsel. 

###### 10 
Do not forsake your own friend or your father's friend, Nor go to your brother's house in the day of your calamity; Better _is_ a neighbor nearby than a brother far away. 

###### 11 
My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, That I may answer him who reproaches me. 

###### 12 
A prudent _man_ foresees evil _and_ hides himself; The simple pass on _and_ are punished. 

###### 13 
Take the garment of him who is surety for a stranger, And hold it in pledge _when_ he is surety for a seductress. 

###### 14 
He who blesses his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, It will be counted a curse to him. 

###### 15 
A continual dripping on a very rainy day And a contentious woman are alike; 

###### 16 
Whoever [^c]restrains her restrains the wind, And grasps oil with his right hand. 

###### 17 
_As_ iron sharpens iron, So a man sharpens the countenance of his friend. 

###### 18 
Whoever [^d]keeps the fig tree will eat its fruit; So he who waits on his master will be honored. 

###### 19 
As in water face _reflects_ face, So a man's heart _reveals_ the man. 

###### 20 
Hell[^e] and [^f]Destruction are never full; So the eyes of man are never satisfied. 

###### 21 
The refining pot _is_ for silver and the furnace for gold, And a man _is valued_ by what others say of him. 

###### 22 
Though you grind a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with crushed grain, _Yet_ his foolishness will not depart from him. 

###### 23 
Be diligent to know the state of your flocks, _And_ attend to your herds; 

###### 24 
For riches _are_ not forever, Nor does a crown _endure_ to all generations. 

###### 25 
_When_ the hay is removed, and the tender grass shows itself, And the herbs of the mountains are gathered in, 

###### 26 
The lambs _will provide_ your clothing, And the goats the price of a field; 

###### 27 
_You shall have_ enough goats' milk for your food, For the food of your household, And the nourishment of your maidservants.

# Proverbs 28

***


###### 1 
The wicked flee when no one pursues, But the righteous are bold as a lion. 

###### 2 
Because of the transgression of a land, many _are_ its princes; But by a man of understanding _and_ knowledge Right will be prolonged. 

###### 3 
A poor man who oppresses the poor _Is like_ a driving rain which leaves no food. 

###### 4 
Those who forsake the law praise the wicked, But such as keep the law contend with them. 

###### 5 
Evil men do not understand justice, But those who seek the Lord understand all. 

###### 6 
Better _is_ the poor who walks in his integrity Than one perverse _in his_ ways, though he _be_ rich. 

###### 7 
Whoever keeps the law _is_ a discerning son, But a companion of gluttons shames his father. 

###### 8 
One who increases his possessions by usury and extortion Gathers it for him who will pity the poor. 

###### 9 
One who turns away his ear from hearing the law, Even his prayer _is_ an abomination. 

###### 10 
Whoever causes the upright to go astray in an evil way, He himself will fall into his own pit; But the blameless will inherit good. 

###### 11 
The rich man _is_ wise in his own eyes, But the poor who has understanding searches him out. 

###### 12 
When the righteous rejoice, _there is_ great glory; But when the wicked arise, men hide themselves. 

###### 13 
He who covers his sins will not prosper, But whoever confesses and forsakes _them_ will have mercy. 

###### 14 
Happy _is_ the man who is always reverent, But he who hardens his heart will fall into calamity. 

###### 15 
_Like_ a roaring lion and a charging bear _Is_ a wicked ruler over poor people. 

###### 16 
A ruler who lacks understanding _is_ a great oppressor, _But_ he who hates covetousness will prolong _his_ days. 

###### 17 
A man burdened with bloodshed will flee into a pit; Let no one help him. 

###### 18 
Whoever walks blamelessly will be saved, But _he who is_ perverse _in his_ ways will suddenly fall. 

###### 19 
He who tills his land will have plenty of bread, But he who follows frivolity will have poverty enough! 

###### 20 
A faithful man will abound with blessings, But he who hastens to be rich will not go unpunished. 

###### 21 
To show partiality _is_ not good, Because for a piece of bread a man will transgress. 

###### 22 
A man with an evil eye hastens after riches, And does not consider that poverty will come upon him. 

###### 23 
He who rebukes a man will find more favor afterward Than he who flatters with the tongue. 

###### 24 
Whoever robs his father or his mother, And says, "_It is_ no transgression," The same _is_ companion to a destroyer. 

###### 25 
He who is of a proud heart stirs up strife, But he who trusts in the Lord will be prospered. 

###### 26 
He who trusts in his own heart is a fool, But whoever walks wisely will be delivered. 

###### 27 
He who gives to the poor will not lack, But he who hides his eyes will have many curses. 

###### 28 
When the wicked arise, men hide themselves; But when they perish, the righteous increase.

# Proverbs 29

***


###### 1 
He who is often rebuked, _and_ hardens _his_ neck, Will suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy. 

###### 2 
When the righteous [^a]are in authority, the people rejoice; But when a wicked _man_ rules, the people groan. 

###### 3 
Whoever loves wisdom makes his father rejoice, But a companion of harlots wastes _his_ wealth. 

###### 4 
The king establishes the land by justice, But he who receives bribes overthrows it. 

###### 5 
A man who flatters his neighbor Spreads a net for his feet. 

###### 6 
By transgression an evil man is snared, But the righteous sings and rejoices. 

###### 7 
The righteous considers the cause of the poor, _But_ the wicked does not understand _such_ knowledge. 

###### 8 
Scoffers set a city aflame, But wise _men_ turn away wrath. 

###### 9 
_If_ a wise man contends with a foolish man, Whether _the fool_ rages or laughs, _there is_ no peace. 

###### 10 
The bloodthirsty hate the blameless, But the upright seek his [^b]well-being. 

###### 11 
A fool vents all his feelings,[^c] But a wise _man_ holds them back. 

###### 12 
If a ruler pays attention to lies, All his servants _become_ wicked. 

###### 13 
The poor _man_ and the oppressor have this in common: The Lord gives light to the eyes of both. 

###### 14 
The king who judges the poor with truth, His throne will be established forever. 

###### 15 
The rod and rebuke give wisdom, But a child left _to himself_ brings shame to his mother. 

###### 16 
When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increases; But the righteous will see their fall. 

###### 17 
Correct your son, and he will give you rest; Yes, he will give delight to your soul. 

###### 18 
Where _there is_ no [^d]revelation, the people cast off restraint; But happy _is_ he who keeps the law. 

###### 19 
A servant will not be corrected by mere words; For though he understands, he will not respond. 

###### 20 
Do you see a man hasty in his words? _There is_ more hope for a fool than for him. 

###### 21 
He who pampers his servant from childhood Will have him as a son in the end. 

###### 22 
An angry man stirs up strife, And a furious man abounds in transgression. 

###### 23 
A man's pride will bring him low, But the humble in spirit will retain honor. 

###### 24 
Whoever is a partner with a thief hates his own life; He [^e]swears to tell the truth, but reveals nothing. 

###### 25 
The fear of man brings a snare, But whoever trusts in the Lord shall be [^f]safe. 

###### 26 
Many seek the ruler's [^g]favor, But justice for man _comes_ from the Lord. 

###### 27 
An unjust man _is_ an abomination to the righteous, And _he who is_ upright in the way _is_ an abomination to the wicked.

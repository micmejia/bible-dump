# Proverbs 31

***


###### 1 
The words of King Lemuel, the utterance which his mother taught him: 

###### 2 
What, my son? And what, son of my womb? And what, son of my vows? 

###### 3 
Do not give your strength to women, Nor your ways to that which destroys kings. 

###### 4 
_It is_ not for kings, O Lemuel, _It is_ not for kings to drink wine, Nor for princes intoxicating drink; 

###### 5 
Lest they drink and forget the law, And pervert the justice of all [^a]the afflicted. 

###### 6 
Give strong drink to him who is perishing, And wine to those who are bitter of heart. 

###### 7 
Let him drink and forget his poverty, And remember his misery no more. 

###### 8 
Open your mouth for the speechless, In the cause of all _who are_ [^b]appointed to die. 

###### 9 
Open your mouth, judge righteously, And plead the cause of the poor and needy. ## The Virtuous Wife 

###### 10 
Who[^c] can find a [^d]virtuous wife? For her worth _is_ far above rubies. 

###### 11 
The heart of her husband safely trusts her; So he will have no lack of gain. 

###### 12 
She does him good and not evil All the days of her life. 

###### 13 
She seeks wool and flax, And willingly works with her hands. 

###### 14 
She is like the merchant ships, She brings her food from afar. 

###### 15 
She also rises while it is yet night, And provides food for her household, And a portion for her maidservants. 

###### 16 
She considers a field and buys it; From [^e]her profits she plants a vineyard. 

###### 17 
She girds herself with strength, And strengthens her arms. 

###### 18 
She perceives that her merchandise _is_ good, And her lamp does not go out by night. 

###### 19 
She stretches out her hands to the distaff, And her hand holds the spindle. 

###### 20 
She extends her hand to the poor, Yes, she reaches out her hands to the needy. 

###### 21 
She is not afraid of snow for her household, For all her household _is_ clothed with scarlet. 

###### 22 
She makes tapestry for herself; Her clothing _is_ fine linen and purple. 

###### 23 
Her husband is known in the gates, When he sits among the elders of the land. 

###### 24 
She makes linen garments and sells _them,_ And supplies sashes for the merchants. 

###### 25 
Strength and honor _are_ her clothing; She shall rejoice in time to come. 

###### 26 
She opens her mouth with wisdom, And on her tongue _is_ the law of kindness. 

###### 27 
She watches over the ways of her household, And does not eat the bread of idleness. 

###### 28 
Her children rise up and call her blessed; Her husband _also,_ and he praises her: 

###### 29 
"Many daughters have done well, But you excel them all." 

###### 30 
Charm _is_ deceitful and beauty _is_ passing, But a woman _who_ fears the Lord, she shall be praised. 

###### 31 
Give her of the fruit of her hands, And let her own works praise her in the gates.

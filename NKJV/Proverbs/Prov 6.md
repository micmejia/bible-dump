# Proverbs 6

***


###### 1 
My son, if you become [^a]surety for your friend, _If_ you have [^b]shaken hands in pledge for a stranger, 

###### 2 
You are snared by the words of your mouth; You are taken by the words of your mouth. 

###### 3 
So do this, my son, and deliver yourself; For you have come into the hand of your friend: Go and humble yourself; Plead with your friend. 

###### 4 
Give no sleep to your eyes, Nor slumber to your eyelids. 

###### 5 
Deliver yourself like a gazelle from the hand _of the hunter,_ And like a bird from the hand of the [^c]fowler. ## The Folly of Indolence 

###### 6 
Go to the ant, you sluggard! Consider her ways and be wise, 

###### 7 
Which, having no [^d]captain, Overseer or ruler, 

###### 8 
Provides her [^e]supplies in the summer, _And_ gathers her food in the harvest. 

###### 9 
How long will you [^f]slumber, O sluggard? When will you rise from your sleep? 

###### 10 
A little sleep, a little slumber, A little folding of the hands to sleep-- 

###### 11 
So shall your poverty come on you like a prowler, And your need like an armed man. ## The Wicked Man 

###### 12 
A worthless person, a wicked man, Walks with a perverse mouth; 

###### 13 
He winks with his eyes, He [^g]shuffles his feet, He points with his fingers; 

###### 14 
Perversity _is_ in his heart, He devises evil continually, He sows discord. 

###### 15 
Therefore his calamity shall come suddenly; Suddenly he shall be broken without remedy. 

###### 16 
These six _things_ the Lord hates, Yes, seven _are_ an abomination to [^h]Him: 

###### 17 
A[^i] proud look, A lying tongue, Hands that shed innocent blood, 

###### 18 
A heart that devises wicked plans, Feet that are swift in running to evil, 

###### 19 
A false witness _who_ speaks lies, And one who sows discord among brethren. ## Beware of Adultery 

###### 20 
My son, keep your father's command, And do not forsake the law of your mother. 

###### 21 
Bind them continually upon your heart; Tie them around your neck. 

###### 22 
When you roam, [^j]they will lead you; When you sleep, they will keep you; And _when_ you awake, they will speak with you. 

###### 23 
For the commandment _is_ a lamp, And the law a light; Reproofs of instruction _are_ the way of life, 

###### 24 
To keep you from the evil woman, From the flattering tongue of a seductress. 

###### 25 
Do not lust after her beauty in your heart, Nor let her allure you with her eyelids. 

###### 26 
For by means of a harlot _A man is reduced_ to a crust of bread; And [^k]an adulteress will prey upon his precious life. 

###### 27 
Can a man take fire to his bosom, And his clothes not be burned? 

###### 28 
Can one walk on hot coals, And his feet not be seared? 

###### 29 
So _is_ he who goes in to his neighbor's wife; Whoever touches her shall not be innocent. 

###### 30 
_People_ do not despise a thief If he steals to satisfy himself when he is starving. 

###### 31 
Yet _when_ he is found, he must restore sevenfold; He may have to give up all the substance of his house. 

###### 32 
Whoever commits adultery with a woman lacks understanding; He _who_ does so destroys his own soul. 

###### 33 
Wounds and dishonor he will get, And his reproach will not be wiped away. 

###### 34 
For jealousy _is_ a husband's fury; Therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance. 

###### 35 
He will [^l]accept no recompense, Nor will he be appeased though you give many gifts.

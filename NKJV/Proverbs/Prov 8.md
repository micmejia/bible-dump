# Proverbs 8

***


###### 1 
Does not wisdom cry out, And understanding lift up her voice? 

###### 2 
She takes her stand on the top of the [^a]high hill, Beside the way, where the paths meet. 

###### 3 
She cries out by the gates, at the entry of the city, At the entrance of the doors: 

###### 4 
"To you, O men, I call, And my voice _is_ to the sons of men. 

###### 5 
O you [^b]simple ones, understand prudence, And you fools, be of an understanding heart. 

###### 6 
Listen, for I will speak of excellent things, And from the opening of my lips _will come_ right things; 

###### 7 
For my mouth will speak truth; Wickedness _is_ an abomination to my lips. 

###### 8 
All the words of my mouth _are_ with righteousness; Nothing crooked or perverse _is_ in them. 

###### 9 
They _are_ all plain to him who understands, And right to those who find knowledge. 

###### 10 
Receive my instruction, and not silver, And knowledge rather than choice gold; 

###### 11 
For wisdom _is_ better than rubies, And all the things one may desire cannot be compared with her. 

###### 12 
"I, wisdom, dwell with prudence, And find out knowledge _and_ discretion. 

###### 13 
The fear of the Lord _is_ to hate evil; Pride and arrogance and the evil way And the perverse mouth I hate. 

###### 14 
Counsel _is_ mine, and sound wisdom; I _am_ understanding, I have strength. 

###### 15 
By me kings reign, And rulers decree justice. 

###### 16 
By me princes rule, and nobles, All the judges of [^c]the earth. 

###### 17 
I love those who love me, And those who seek me diligently will find me. 

###### 18 
Riches and honor _are_ with me, Enduring riches and righteousness. 

###### 19 
My fruit _is_ better than gold, yes, than fine gold, And my revenue than choice silver. 

###### 20 
I [^d]traverse the way of righteousness, In the midst of the paths of justice, 

###### 21 
That I may cause those who love me to inherit wealth, That I may fill their treasuries. 

###### 22 
"The Lord possessed me at the beginning of His way, Before His works of old. 

###### 23 
I have been established from everlasting, From the beginning, before there was ever an earth. 

###### 24 
When _there were_ no depths I was brought forth, When _there were_ no fountains abounding with water. 

###### 25 
Before the mountains were settled, Before the hills, I was brought forth; 

###### 26 
While as yet He had not made the earth or the [^e]fields, Or the [^f]primal dust of the world. 

###### 27 
When He prepared the heavens, I _was_ there, When He drew a circle on the face of the deep, 

###### 28 
When He established the clouds above, When He strengthened the fountains of the deep, 

###### 29 
When He assigned to the sea its limit, So that the waters would not transgress His command, When He marked out the foundations of the earth, 

###### 30 
Then I was beside Him _as_ [^g]a master craftsman; And I was daily _His_ delight, Rejoicing always before Him, 

###### 31 
Rejoicing in His inhabited world, And my delight _was_ with the sons of men. 

###### 32 
"Now therefore, listen to me, _my_ children, For blessed _are those who_ keep my ways. 

###### 33 
Hear instruction and be wise, And do not disdain _it._ 

###### 34 
Blessed is the man who listens to me, Watching daily at my gates, Waiting at the posts of my doors. 

###### 35 
For whoever finds me finds life, And obtains favor from the Lord; 

###### 36 
But he who sins against me wrongs his own soul; All those who hate me love death."

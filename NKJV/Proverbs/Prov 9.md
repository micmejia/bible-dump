# Proverbs 9

***


###### 1 
Wisdom has built her house, She has hewn out her seven pillars; 

###### 2 
She has slaughtered her meat, She has mixed her wine, She has also furnished her table. 

###### 3 
She has sent out her maidens, She cries out from the highest places of the city, 

###### 4 
"Whoever _is_ simple, let him turn in here!" _As for_ him who lacks understanding, she says to him, 

###### 5 
"Come, eat of my bread And drink of the wine I have mixed. 

###### 6 
Forsake foolishness and live, And go in the way of understanding. 

###### 7 
"He who corrects a scoffer gets shame for himself, And he who rebukes a wicked _man only_ harms himself. 

###### 8 
Do not correct a scoffer, lest he hate you; Rebuke a wise _man,_ and he will love you. 

###### 9 
Give _instruction_ to a wise _man,_ and he will be still wiser; Teach a just _man,_ and he will increase in learning. 

###### 10 
"The fear of the Lord _is_ the beginning of wisdom, And the knowledge of the Holy One _is_ understanding. 

###### 11 
For by me your days will be multiplied, And years of life will be added to you. 

###### 12 
If you are wise, you are wise for yourself, And _if_ you scoff, you will bear _it_ alone." ## The Way of Folly 

###### 13 
A foolish woman is clamorous; _She is_ simple, and knows nothing. 

###### 14 
For she sits at the door of her house, On a seat _by_ the highest places of the city, 

###### 15 
To call to those who pass by, Who go straight on their way: 

###### 16 
"Whoever _is_ simple, let him turn in here"; And _as for_ him who lacks understanding, she says to him, 

###### 17 
"Stolen water is sweet, And bread _eaten_ in secret is pleasant." 

###### 18 
But he does not know that the dead _are_ there, _That_ her guests _are_ in the depths of hell.

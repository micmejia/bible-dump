# Psalms 1

***


###### 1 
Blessed _is_ the man Who walks not in the counsel of the [^a]ungodly, Nor stands in the path of sinners, Nor sits in the seat of the scornful; 

###### 2 
But his delight _is_ in the law of the Lord, And in His law he [^b]meditates day and night. 

###### 3 
He shall be like a tree Planted by the [^c]rivers of water, That brings forth its fruit in its season, Whose leaf also shall not wither; And whatever he does shall prosper. 

###### 4 
The ungodly _are_ not so, But _are_ like the chaff which the wind drives away. 

###### 5 
Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. 

###### 6 
For the Lord knows the way of the righteous, But the way of the ungodly shall perish.

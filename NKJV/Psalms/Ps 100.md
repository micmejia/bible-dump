# Psalms 100

***


###### 1 
Make a joyful shout to the Lord, [^a]all you lands! 

###### 2 
Serve the Lord with gladness; Come before His presence with singing. 

###### 3 
Know that the Lord, He _is_ God; _It is_ He _who_ has made us, and [^b]not we ourselves; _We are_ His people and the sheep of His pasture. 

###### 4 
Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, _And_ into His courts with praise. Be thankful to Him, _and_ bless His name. 

###### 5 
For the Lord _is_ good; His mercy _is_ everlasting, And His truth _endures_ to all generations.

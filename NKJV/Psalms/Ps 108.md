# Psalms 108

***


###### 1 
O God, my heart is steadfast; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory. 

###### 2 
Awake, lute and harp! I will awaken the dawn. 

###### 3 
I will praise You, O Lord, among the peoples, And I will sing praises to You among the nations. 

###### 4 
For Your mercy _is_ great above the heavens, And Your truth _reaches_ to the clouds. 

###### 5 
Be exalted, O God, above the heavens, And Your glory above all the earth; 

###### 6 
That Your beloved may be delivered, Save _with_ Your right hand, and hear me. 

###### 7 
God has spoken in His holiness: "I will rejoice; I will divide Shechem And measure out the Valley of Succoth. 

###### 8 
Gilead _is_ Mine; Manasseh _is_ Mine; Ephraim also _is_ the helmet for My head; Judah _is_ My lawgiver. 

###### 9 
Moab _is_ My washpot; Over Edom I will cast My shoe; Over Philistia I will triumph." 

###### 10 
Who will bring me _into_ the strong city? Who will lead me to Edom? 

###### 11 
_Is it_ not _You,_ O God, _who_ cast us off? And _You,_ O God, _who_ did not go out with our armies? 

###### 12 
Give us help from trouble, For the help of man is useless. 

###### 13 
Through God we will do valiantly, For _it is_ He _who_ shall tread down our enemies.

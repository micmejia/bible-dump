# Psalms 110

***


###### 1 
The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at My right hand, Till I make Your enemies Your footstool." 

###### 2 
The Lord shall send the rod of Your strength out of Zion. Rule in the midst of Your enemies! 

###### 3 
Your people _shall be_ volunteers In the day of Your power; In the beauties of holiness, from the womb of the morning, You have the dew of Your youth. 

###### 4 
The Lord has sworn And will not relent, "You _are_ a priest forever According to the order of Melchizedek." 

###### 5 
The Lord _is_ at Your right hand; He shall execute kings in the day of His wrath. 

###### 6 
He shall judge among the nations, He shall fill _the places_ with dead bodies, He shall execute the heads of many countries. 

###### 7 
He shall drink of the brook by the wayside; Therefore He shall lift up the head.

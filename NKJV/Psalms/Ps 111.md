###### 1 
Praise[^a] the Lord! I will praise the Lord with _my_ whole heart, In the assembly of the upright and _in_ the congregation. 

###### 2 
The works of the Lord _are_ great, Studied by all who have pleasure in them. 

###### 3 
His work _is_ honorable and glorious, And His righteousness endures forever. 

###### 4 
He has made His wonderful works to be remembered; The Lord _is_ gracious and full of compassion. 

###### 5 
He has given food to those who fear Him; He will ever be mindful of His covenant. 

###### 6 
He has declared to His people the power of His works, In giving them the [^b]heritage of the nations. 

###### 7 
The works of His hands _are_ verity[^c] and justice; All His precepts _are_ sure. 

###### 8 
They stand fast forever and ever, _And are_ done in truth and uprightness. 

###### 9 
He has sent redemption to His people; He has commanded His covenant forever: Holy and awesome _is_ His name. 

###### 10 
The fear of the Lord _is_ the beginning of wisdom; A good understanding have all those who do _His commandments._ His praise endures forever.

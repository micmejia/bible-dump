# Psalms 112

***


###### 1 
Praise the Lord! Blessed _is_ the man _who_ fears the Lord, _Who_ delights greatly in His commandments. 

###### 2 
His descendants will be mighty on earth; The generation of the upright will be blessed. 

###### 3 
Wealth and riches _will be_ in his house, And his righteousness endures forever. 

###### 4 
Unto the upright there arises light in the darkness; _He is_ gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous. 

###### 5 
A good man deals graciously and lends; He will guide his affairs with discretion. 

###### 6 
Surely he will never be shaken; The righteous will be in everlasting remembrance. 

###### 7 
He will not be afraid of evil tidings; His heart is steadfast, trusting in the Lord. 

###### 8 
His heart _is_ established; He will not be afraid, Until he sees _his desire_ upon his enemies. 

###### 9 
He has dispersed abroad, He has given to the poor; His righteousness endures forever; His horn will be exalted with honor. 

###### 10 
The wicked will see _it_ and be grieved; He will gnash his teeth and melt away; The desire of the wicked shall perish.

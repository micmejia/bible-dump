# Psalms 113

***


###### 1 
Praise[^a] the Lord! Praise, O servants of the Lord, Praise the name of the Lord! 

###### 2 
Blessed be the name of the Lord From this time forth and forevermore! 

###### 3 
From the rising of the sun to its going down The Lord's name _is_ to be praised. 

###### 4 
The Lord _is_ high above all nations, His glory above the heavens. 

###### 5 
Who _is_ like the Lord our God, Who dwells on high, 

###### 6 
Who humbles Himself to behold _The things that are_ in the heavens and in the earth? 

###### 7 
He raises the poor out of the dust, _And_ lifts the needy out of the ash heap, 

###### 8 
That He may seat _him_ with princes-- With the princes of His people. 

###### 9 
He grants the [^b]barren woman a home, Like a joyful mother of children.

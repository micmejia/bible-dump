# Psalms 12

***


###### 1 
Help, Lord, for the godly man ceases! For the faithful disappear from among the sons of men. 

###### 2 
They speak idly everyone with his neighbor; _With_ flattering lips _and_ a double heart they speak. 

###### 3 
May the Lord cut off all flattering lips, _And_ the tongue that speaks proud things, 

###### 4 
Who have said, "With our tongue we will prevail; Our lips _are_ our own; Who _is_ lord over us?" 

###### 5 
"For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, Now I will arise," says the Lord; "I will set _him_ in the safety for which he yearns." 

###### 6 
The words of the Lord _are_ pure words, _Like_ silver tried in a furnace of earth, Purified seven times. 

###### 7 
You shall keep them, O Lord, You shall preserve them from this generation forever. 

###### 8 
The wicked prowl on every side, When vileness is exalted among the sons of men.

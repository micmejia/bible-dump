# Psalms 120

***


###### 1 
In my distress I cried to the Lord, And He heard me. 

###### 2 
Deliver my soul, O Lord, from lying lips _And_ from a deceitful tongue. 

###### 3 
What shall be given to you, Or what shall be done to you, You false tongue? 

###### 4 
Sharp arrows of the [^a]warrior, With coals of the broom tree! 

###### 5 
Woe is me, that I dwell in Meshech, _That_ I dwell among the tents of Kedar! 

###### 6 
My soul has dwelt too long With one who hates peace. 

###### 7 
I _am for_ peace; But when I speak, they _are_ for war. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Psalms 121

***


###### 1 
I will lift up my eyes to the hills-- From whence comes my help? 

###### 2 
My help _comes_ from the Lord, Who made heaven and earth. 

###### 3 
He will not allow your foot to [^a]be moved; He who keeps you will not slumber. 

###### 4 
Behold, He who keeps Israel Shall neither slumber nor sleep. 

###### 5 
The Lord _is_ your [^b]keeper; The Lord _is_ your shade at your right hand. 

###### 6 
The sun shall not strike you by day, Nor the moon by night. 

###### 7 
The Lord shall [^c]preserve you from all evil; He shall preserve your soul. 

###### 8 
The Lord shall preserve[^d] your going out and your coming in From this time forth, and even forevermore. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

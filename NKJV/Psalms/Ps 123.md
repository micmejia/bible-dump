# Psalms 123

***


###### 1 
Unto You I lift up my eyes, O You who dwell in the heavens. 

###### 2 
Behold, as the eyes of servants _look_ to the hand of their masters, As the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress, So our eyes _look_ to the Lord our God, Until He has mercy on us. 

###### 3 
Have mercy on us, O Lord, have mercy on us! For we are exceedingly filled with contempt. 

###### 4 
Our soul is exceedingly filled With the scorn of those who are at ease, With the contempt of the proud. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

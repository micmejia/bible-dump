# Psalms 124

***


###### 1 
"If it had not been the Lord who was on our side," Let Israel now say-- 

###### 2 
"If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, When men rose up against us, 

###### 3 
Then they would have swallowed us alive, When their wrath was kindled against us; 

###### 4 
Then the waters would have overwhelmed us, The stream would have [^a]gone over our soul; 

###### 5 
Then the swollen waters Would have [^b]gone over our soul." 

###### 6 
Blessed _be_ the Lord, Who has not given us _as_ prey to their teeth. 

###### 7 
Our soul has escaped as a bird from the snare of the [^c]fowlers; The snare is broken, and we have escaped. 

###### 8 
Our help _is_ in the name of the Lord, Who made heaven and earth. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Psalms 125

***


###### 1 
Those who trust in the Lord _Are_ like Mount Zion, _Which_ cannot be moved, _but_ abides forever. 

###### 2 
As the mountains surround Jerusalem, So the Lord surrounds His people From this time forth and forever. 

###### 3 
For the scepter of wickedness shall not rest On the land allotted to the righteous, Lest the righteous reach out their hands to iniquity. 

###### 4 
Do good, O Lord, to _those who are_ good, And to _those who are_ upright in their hearts. 

###### 5 
As for such as turn aside to their crooked ways, The Lord shall lead them away With the workers of iniquity. Peace _be_ upon Israel!

# Psalms 126

***


###### 1 
When the Lord brought back [^a]the captivity of Zion, We were like those who dream. 

###### 2 
Then our mouth was filled with laughter, And our tongue with singing. Then they said among the [^b]nations, "The Lord has done great things for them." 

###### 3 
The Lord has done great things for us, _And_ we are glad. 

###### 4 
Bring back our captivity, O Lord, As the streams in the South. 

###### 5 
Those who sow in tears Shall reap in joy. 

###### 6 
He who continually goes [^c]forth weeping, Bearing [^d]seed for sowing, Shall doubtless come again [^e]with rejoicing, Bringing his sheaves _with him._ ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

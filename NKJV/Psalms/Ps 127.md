# Psalms 127

***


###### 1 
Unless the Lord builds the house, They labor in vain who build it; Unless the Lord guards the city, The watchman stays awake in vain. 

###### 2 
_It is_ vain for you to rise up early, To sit up late, To eat the bread of sorrows; _For_ so He gives His beloved sleep. 

###### 3 
Behold, children _are_ a heritage from the Lord, The fruit of the womb _is_ a reward. 

###### 4 
Like arrows in the hand of a warrior, So _are_ the children of one's youth. 

###### 5 
Happy _is_ the man who has his quiver full of them; They shall not be ashamed, But shall speak with their enemies in the gate.

# Psalms 128

***


###### 1 
Blessed _is_ every one who fears the Lord, Who walks in His ways. 

###### 2 
When you eat the labor of your hands, You _shall be_ happy, and _it shall be_ well with you. 

###### 3 
Your wife _shall be_ like a fruitful vine In the very heart of your house, Your children like olive plants All around your table. 

###### 4 
Behold, thus shall the man be blessed Who fears the Lord. 

###### 5 
The Lord bless you out of Zion, And may you see the good of Jerusalem All the days of your life. 

###### 6 
Yes, may you see your children's children. Peace _be_ upon Israel!

# Psalms 129

***


###### 1 
"Many a time they have afflicted[^a] me from my youth," Let Israel now say-- 

###### 2 
"Many a time they have afflicted me from my youth; Yet they have not prevailed against me. 

###### 3 
The plowers plowed on my back; They made their furrows long." 

###### 4 
The Lord _is_ righteous; He has cut in pieces the cords of the wicked. 

###### 5 
Let all those who hate Zion Be put to shame and turned back. 

###### 6 
Let them be as the grass _on_ the housetops, Which withers before it grows up, 

###### 7 
With which the reaper does not fill his hand, Nor he who binds sheaves, his [^b]arms. 

###### 8 
Neither let those who pass by them say, "The blessing of the Lord _be_ upon you; We bless you in the name of the Lord!" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

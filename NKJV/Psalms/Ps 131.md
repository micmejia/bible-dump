# Psalms 131

***


###### 1 
Lord, my heart is not [^a]haughty, Nor my eyes [^b]lofty. Neither do I [^c]concern myself with great matters, Nor with things too [^d]profound for me. 

###### 2 
Surely I have calmed and quieted my soul, Like a weaned child with his mother; Like a weaned child _is_ my soul within me. 

###### 3 
O Israel, hope in the Lord From this time forth and forever.

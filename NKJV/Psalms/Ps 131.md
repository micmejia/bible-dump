# Psalms 131

***


###### 1 
Lord, my heart is not haughty, Nor my eyes lofty. Neither do I concern myself with great matters, Nor with things too profound for me. 

###### 2 
Surely I have calmed and quieted my soul, Like a weaned child with his mother; Like a weaned child is my soul within me. 

###### 3 
O Israel, hope in the Lord From this time forth and forever.

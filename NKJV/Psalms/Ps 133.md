# Psalms 133

***


###### 1 
Behold, how good and how pleasant _it is_ For brethren to dwell together in unity! 

###### 2 
_It is_ like the precious oil upon the head, Running down on the beard, The beard of Aaron, Running down on the edge of his garments. 

###### 3 
_It is_ like the dew of Hermon, Descending upon the mountains of Zion; For there the Lord commanded the blessing-- Life forevermore.

# Psalms 14

***


###### 1 
The fool has said in his heart, "_There is_ no God." They are corrupt, They have done abominable works, There is none who does good. 

###### 2 
The Lord looks down from heaven upon the children of men, To see if there are any who understand, who seek God. 

###### 3 
They have all turned aside, They have together become corrupt; _There is_ none who does good, No, not one. 

###### 4 
Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge, Who eat up my people _as_ they eat bread, And do not call on the Lord? 

###### 5 
There they are in great fear, For God _is_ with the generation of the righteous. 

###### 6 
You shame the counsel of the poor, But the Lord _is_ his refuge. 

###### 7 
Oh,[^a] that the salvation of Israel _would come_ out of Zion! When the Lord brings back [^b]the captivity of His people, Let Jacob rejoice _and_ Israel be glad.

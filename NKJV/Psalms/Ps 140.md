# Psalms 140

***


###### 1 
Deliver me, O Lord, from evil men; Preserve me from violent men, 

###### 2 
Who plan evil things in _their_ hearts; They continually gather together _for_ war. 

###### 3 
They sharpen their tongues like a serpent; The poison of asps _is_ under their lips. <i class="selah">Selah_ 

###### 4 
Keep me, O Lord, from the hands of the wicked; Preserve me from violent men, Who have purposed to make my steps stumble. 

###### 5 
The proud have hidden a snare for me, and cords; They have spread a net by the wayside; They have set traps for me. <i class="selah">Selah_ 

###### 6 
I said to the Lord: "You _are_ my God; Hear the voice of my supplications, O Lord. 

###### 7 
O God the Lord, the strength of my salvation, You have covered my head in the day of battle. 

###### 8 
Do not grant, O Lord, the desires of the wicked; Do not further his _wicked_ scheme, _Lest_ they be exalted. <i class="selah">Selah_ 

###### 9 
"_As for_ the head of those who surround me, Let the evil of their lips cover them; 

###### 10 
Let burning coals fall upon them; Let them be cast into the fire, Into deep pits, that they rise not up again. 

###### 11 
Let not a slanderer be established in the earth; Let evil hunt the violent man to overthrow _him._" 

###### 12 
I know that the Lord will maintain The cause of the afflicted, _And_ justice for the poor. 

###### 13 
Surely the righteous shall give thanks to Your name; The upright shall dwell in Your presence.

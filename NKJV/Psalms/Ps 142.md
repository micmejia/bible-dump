# Psalms 142

***


###### 1 
I cry out to the Lord with my voice; With my voice to the Lord I make my supplication. 

###### 2 
I pour out my complaint before Him; I declare before Him my trouble. 

###### 3 
When my spirit [^b]was overwhelmed within me, Then You knew my path. In the way in which I walk They have secretly set a snare for me. 

###### 4 
Look on _my_ right hand and see, For _there is_ no one who acknowledges me; Refuge has failed me; No one cares for my soul. 

###### 5 
I cried out to You, O Lord: I said, "You _are_ my refuge, My portion in the land of the living. 

###### 6 
[^c]Attend to my cry, For I am brought very low; Deliver me from my persecutors, For they are stronger than I. 

###### 7 
Bring my soul out of prison, That I may praise Your name; The righteous shall surround me, For You shall deal bountifully with me."

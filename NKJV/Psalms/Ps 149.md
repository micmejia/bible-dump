# Psalms 149

***


###### 1 
Praise the Lord! Sing to the Lord a new song, _And_ His praise in the assembly of saints. 

###### 2 
Let Israel rejoice in their Maker; Let the children of Zion be joyful in their King. 

###### 3 
Let them praise His name with the dance; Let them sing praises to Him with the timbrel and harp. 

###### 4 
For the Lord takes pleasure in His people; He will beautify the humble with salvation. 

###### 5 
Let the saints be joyful in glory; Let them sing aloud on their beds. 

###### 6 
_Let_ the high praises of God _be_ in their mouth, And a two-edged sword in their hand, 

###### 7 
To execute vengeance on the nations, And punishments on the peoples; 

###### 8 
To bind their kings with chains, And their nobles with fetters of iron; 

###### 9 
To execute on them the written judgment-- This honor have all His saints. Praise the Lord!

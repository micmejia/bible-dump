# Psalms 150

***


###### 1 
Praise[^a] the Lord! Praise God in His sanctuary; Praise Him in His mighty [^b]firmament! 

###### 2 
Praise Him for His mighty acts; Praise Him according to His excellent greatness! 

###### 3 
Praise Him with the sound of the [^c]trumpet; Praise Him with the lute and harp! 

###### 4 
Praise Him with the timbrel and dance; Praise Him with stringed instruments and flutes! 

###### 5 
Praise Him with loud cymbals; Praise Him with clashing cymbals! 

###### 6 
Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. [^d]Praise the Lord!

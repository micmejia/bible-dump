# Psalms 16

***


###### 1 
Preserve me, O God, for in You I put my trust. 

###### 2 
_O my soul,_ you have said to the Lord, "You _are_ my Lord, My goodness is nothing apart from You." 

###### 3 
As for the saints who _are_ on the earth, "They are the excellent ones, in whom is all my delight." 

###### 4 
Their sorrows shall be multiplied who hasten _after_ another _god;_ Their drink offerings of blood I will not offer, Nor take up their names on my lips. 

###### 5 
O Lord, _You are_ the portion of my inheritance and my cup; You maintain my lot. 

###### 6 
The lines have fallen to me in pleasant _places;_ Yes, I have a good inheritance. 

###### 7 
I will bless the Lord who has given me counsel; My heart also instructs me in the night seasons. 

###### 8 
I have set the Lord always before me; Because _He is_ at my right hand I shall not be moved. 

###### 9 
Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoices; My flesh also will rest in hope. 

###### 10 
For You will not leave my soul in Sheol, Nor will You allow Your Holy One to see corruption. 

###### 11 
You will show me the path of life; In Your presence _is_ fullness of joy; At Your right hand _are_ pleasures forevermore.

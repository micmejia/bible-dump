# Psalms 2

***


###### 1 
Why do the nations rage, And the people plot a vain thing? 

###### 2 
The kings of the earth set themselves, And the rulers take counsel together, Against the Lord and against His Anointed, _saying,_ 

###### 3 
"Let us break Their bonds in pieces And cast away Their cords from us." 

###### 4 
He who sits in the heavens shall laugh; The Lord shall hold them in derision. 

###### 5 
Then He shall speak to them in His wrath, And distress them in His deep displeasure: 

###### 6 
"Yet I have set My King On My holy hill of Zion." 

###### 7 
"I will declare the decree: The Lord has said to Me, 'You _are_ My Son, Today I have begotten You. 

###### 8 
Ask of Me, and I will give _You_ The nations _for_ Your inheritance, And the ends of the earth _for_ Your possession. 

###### 9 
You shall break them with a rod of iron; You shall dash them to pieces like a potter's vessel.' " 

###### 10 
Now therefore, be wise, O kings; Be instructed, you judges of the earth. 

###### 11 
Serve the Lord with fear, And rejoice with trembling. 

###### 12 
Kiss the Son, lest He be angry, And you perish _in_ the way, When His wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed _are_ all those who put their trust in Him.

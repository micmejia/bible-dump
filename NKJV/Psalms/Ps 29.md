# Psalms 29

***


###### 1 
Give[^a] unto the Lord, O you mighty ones, Give unto the Lord glory and strength. 

###### 2 
[^b]Give unto the Lord the glory [^c]due to His name; Worship the Lord in the [^d]beauty of holiness. 

###### 3 
The voice of the Lord _is_ over the waters; The God of glory thunders; The Lord _is_ over many waters. 

###### 4 
The voice of the Lord _is_ powerful; The voice of the Lord _is_ full of majesty. 

###### 5 
The voice of the Lord breaks the cedars, Yes, the Lord splinters the cedars of Lebanon. 

###### 6 
He makes them also skip like a calf, Lebanon and Sirion like a young wild ox. 

###### 7 
The voice of the Lord [^e]divides the flames of fire. 

###### 8 
The voice of the Lord shakes the wilderness; The Lord shakes the Wilderness of Kadesh. 

###### 9 
The voice of the Lord makes the deer give birth, And strips the forests bare; And in His temple everyone says, "Glory!" 

###### 10 
The Lord sat _enthroned_ at the Flood, And the Lord sits as King forever. 

###### 11 
The Lord will give strength to His people; The Lord will bless His people with peace.

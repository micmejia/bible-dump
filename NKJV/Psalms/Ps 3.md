# Psalms 3

***


###### 1 
Lord, how they have increased who trouble me! Many _are_ they who rise up against me. 

###### 2 
Many _are_ they who say of me, "_There is_ no help for him in God." <i class="selah">Selah_ 

###### 3 
But You, O Lord, _are_ a shield [^a]for me, My glory and the One who lifts up my head. 

###### 4 
I cried to the Lord with my voice, And He heard me from His holy hill. <i class="selah">Selah_ 

###### 5 
I lay down and slept; I awoke, for the Lord sustained me. 

###### 6 
I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people Who have set _themselves_ against me all around. 

###### 7 
Arise, O Lord; Save me, O my God! For You have struck all my enemies on the cheekbone; You have broken the teeth of the ungodly. 

###### 8 
Salvation _belongs_ to the Lord. Your blessing _is_ upon Your people. <i class="selah">Selah_

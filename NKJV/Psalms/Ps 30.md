# Psalms 30

***


###### 1 
I will extol You, O Lord, for You have lifted me up, And have not let my foes rejoice over me. 

###### 2 
O Lord my God, I cried out to You, And You healed me. 

###### 3 
O Lord, You brought my soul up from the grave; You have kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit. 

###### 4 
Sing praise to the Lord, you saints of His, And give thanks at the remembrance of His holy name. 

###### 5 
For His anger _is but for_ a moment, His favor _is for_ life; Weeping may endure for a night, But joy _comes_ in the morning. 

###### 6 
Now in my prosperity I said, "I shall never be moved." 

###### 7 
Lord, by Your favor You have made my mountain stand strong; You hid Your face, _and_ I was troubled. 

###### 8 
I cried out to You, O Lord; And to the Lord I made supplication: 

###### 9 
"What profit _is there_ in my blood, When I go down to the pit? Will the dust praise You? Will it declare Your truth? 

###### 10 
Hear, O Lord, and have mercy on me; Lord, be my helper!" 

###### 11 
You have turned for me my mourning into dancing; You have put off my sackcloth and clothed me with gladness, 

###### 12 
To the end that _my_ glory may sing praise to You and not be silent. O Lord my God, I will give thanks to You forever.

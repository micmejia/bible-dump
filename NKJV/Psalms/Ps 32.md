# Psalms 32

***


###### 1 
Blessed _is he whose_ transgression _is_ forgiven, _Whose_ sin _is_ covered. 

###### 2 
Blessed _is_ the man to whom the Lord does not impute iniquity, And in whose spirit _there is_ no deceit. 

###### 3 
When I kept silent, my bones grew old Through my groaning all the day long. 

###### 4 
For day and night Your hand was heavy upon me; My vitality was turned into the drought of summer. Selah_ 

###### 5 
I acknowledged my sin to You, And my iniquity I have not hidden. I said, "I will confess my transgressions to the Lord," And You forgave the iniquity of my sin. Selah_ 

###### 6 
For this cause everyone who is godly shall pray to You In a time when You may be found; Surely in a flood of great waters They shall not come near him. 

###### 7 
You _are_ my hiding place; You shall preserve me from trouble; You shall surround me with songs of deliverance. Selah_ 

###### 8 
I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; I will guide you with My eye. 

###### 9 
Do not be like the horse _or_ like the mule, _Which_ have no understanding, Which must be harnessed with bit and bridle, Else they will not come near you. 

###### 10 
Many sorrows _shall be_ to the wicked; But he who trusts in the Lord, mercy shall surround him. 

###### 11 
Be glad in the Lord and rejoice, you righteous; And shout for joy, all _you_ upright in heart!

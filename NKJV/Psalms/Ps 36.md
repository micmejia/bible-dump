# Psalms 36

***


###### 1 
An oracle within my heart concerning the transgression of the wicked: _There is_ no fear of God before his eyes. 

###### 2 
For he flatters himself in his own eyes, When he finds out his iniquity _and_ when he hates. 

###### 3 
The words of his mouth _are_ wickedness and deceit; He has ceased to be wise _and_ to do good. 

###### 4 
He devises wickedness on his bed; He sets himself in a way _that is_ not good; He does not [^a]abhor evil. 

###### 5 
Your mercy, O Lord, _is_ in the heavens; Your faithfulness _reaches_ to the clouds. 

###### 6 
Your righteousness _is_ like the [^b]great mountains; Your judgments _are_ a great deep; O Lord, You preserve man and beast. 

###### 7 
How precious _is_ Your lovingkindness, O God! Therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of Your wings. 

###### 8 
They are abundantly satisfied with the fullness of Your house, And You give them drink from the river of Your pleasures. 

###### 9 
For with You _is_ the fountain of life; In Your light we see light. 

###### 10 
Oh, continue Your lovingkindness to those who know You, And Your righteousness to the upright in heart. 

###### 11 
Let not the foot of pride come against me, And let not the hand of the wicked drive me away. 

###### 12 
There the workers of iniquity have fallen; They have been cast down and are not able to rise.

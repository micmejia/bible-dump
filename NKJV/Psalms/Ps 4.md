# Psalms 4

***


###### 1 
Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness! You have relieved me in _my_ distress; [^b]Have mercy on me, and hear my prayer. 

###### 2 
How long, O you sons of men, _Will you turn_ my glory to shame? _How long_ will you love worthlessness _And_ seek falsehood? <i class="selah">Selah_ 

###### 3 
But know that the Lord has [^c]set apart for Himself him who is godly; The Lord will hear when I call to Him. 

###### 4 
Be[^d] angry, and do not sin. Meditate within your heart on your bed, and be still. <i class="selah">Selah_ 

###### 5 
Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, And put your trust in the Lord. 

###### 6 
_There are_ many who say, "Who will show us _any_ good?" Lord, lift up the light of Your countenance upon us. 

###### 7 
You have put gladness in my heart, More than in the season that their grain and wine increased. 

###### 8 
I will both lie down in peace, and sleep; For You alone, O Lord, make me dwell in safety.

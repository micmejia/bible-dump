# Psalms 43

***


###### 1 
Vindicate me, O God, And plead my cause against an ungodly nation; Oh, deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man! 

###### 2 
For You _are_ the God of my strength; Why do You cast me off? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy? 

###### 3 
Oh, send out Your light and Your truth! Let them lead me; Let them bring me to Your holy hill And to Your [^a]tabernacle. 

###### 4 
Then I will go to the altar of God, To God my exceeding joy; And on the harp I will praise You, O God, my God. 

###### 5 
Why are you cast down, O my soul? And why are you disquieted within me? Hope in God; For I shall yet praise Him, The [^b]help of my countenance and my God. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Psalms 46

***


###### 1 
God _is_ our refuge and strength, A very present help in trouble. 

###### 2 
Therefore we will not fear, Even though the earth be removed, And though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea; 

###### 3 
_Though_ its waters roar _and_ be troubled, _Though_ the mountains shake with its swelling. Selah_ 

###### 4 
_There is_ a river whose streams shall make glad the city of God, The holy _place_ of the tabernacle of the Most High. 

###### 5 
God _is_ in the midst of her, she shall not be moved; God shall help her, just at the break of dawn. 

###### 6 
The nations raged, the kingdoms were moved; He uttered His voice, the earth melted. 

###### 7 
The Lord of hosts _is_ with us; The God of Jacob _is_ our refuge. Selah_ 

###### 8 
Come, behold the works of the Lord, Who has made desolations in the earth. 

###### 9 
He makes wars cease to the end of the earth; He breaks the bow and cuts the spear in two; He burns the chariot in the fire. 

###### 10 
Be still, and know that I _am_ God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth! 

###### 11 
The Lord of hosts _is_ with us; The God of Jacob _is_ our refuge. Selah_

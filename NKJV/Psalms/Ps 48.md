# Psalms 48

***


###### 1 
Great _is_ the Lord, and greatly to be praised In the city of our God, _In_ His holy mountain. 

###### 2 
Beautiful in elevation, The joy of the whole earth, _Is_ Mount Zion _on_ the sides of the north, The city of the great King. 

###### 3 
God _is_ in her palaces; He is known as her refuge. 

###### 4 
For behold, the kings assembled, They passed by together. 

###### 5 
They saw _it, and_ so they marveled; They were troubled, they hastened away. 

###### 6 
Fear took hold of them there, _And_ pain, as of a woman in birth pangs, 

###### 7 
_As when_ You break the ships of Tarshish With an east wind. 

###### 8 
As we have heard, So we have seen In the city of the Lord of hosts, In the city of our God: God will establish it forever. Selah_ 

###### 9 
We have thought, O God, on Your lovingkindness, In the midst of Your temple. 

###### 10 
According to Your name, O God, So _is_ Your praise to the ends of the earth; Your right hand is full of righteousness. 

###### 11 
Let Mount Zion rejoice, Let the daughters of Judah be glad, Because of Your judgments. 

###### 12 
Walk about Zion, And go all around her. Count her towers; 

###### 13 
Mark well her bulwarks; Consider her palaces; That you may tell _it_ to the generation following. 

###### 14 
For this _is_ God, Our God forever and ever; He will be our guide _Even_ to death.

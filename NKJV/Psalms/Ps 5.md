# Psalms 5

***


###### 1 
Give ear to my words, O Lord, Consider my [^b]meditation. 

###### 2 
Give heed to the voice of my cry, My King and my God, For to You I will pray. 

###### 3 
My voice You shall hear in the morning, O Lord; In the morning I will direct _it_ to You, And I will look up. 

###### 4 
For You _are_ not a God who takes pleasure in wickedness, Nor shall evil [^c]dwell with You. 

###### 5 
The boastful shall not stand in Your sight; You hate all workers of iniquity. 

###### 6 
You shall destroy those who speak falsehood; The Lord abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man. 

###### 7 
But as for me, I will come into Your house in the multitude of Your mercy; In fear of You I will worship toward [^d]Your holy temple. 

###### 8 
Lead me, O Lord, in Your righteousness because of my enemies; Make Your way straight before my face. 

###### 9 
For _there is_ no [^e]faithfulness in their mouth; Their inward part _is_ destruction; Their throat _is_ an open tomb; They flatter with their tongue. 

###### 10 
Pronounce them guilty, O God! Let them fall by their own counsels; Cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions, For they have rebelled against You. 

###### 11 
But let all those rejoice who put their trust in You; Let them ever shout for joy, because You [^f]defend them; Let those also who love Your name Be joyful in You. 

###### 12 
For You, O Lord, will bless the righteous; With favor You will surround him as _with_ a shield.

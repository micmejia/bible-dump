# Psalms 52

***


###### 1 
Why do you boast in evil, O mighty man? The goodness of God _endures_ continually. 

###### 2 
Your tongue devises destruction, Like a sharp razor, working deceitfully. 

###### 3 
You love evil more than good, Lying rather than speaking righteousness. <i class="selah">Selah_ 

###### 4 
You love all devouring words, _You_ deceitful tongue. 

###### 5 
God shall likewise destroy you forever; He shall take you away, and pluck you out of _your_ dwelling place, And uproot you from the land of the living. <i class="selah">Selah_ 

###### 6 
The righteous also shall see and fear, And shall laugh at him, _saying,_ 

###### 7 
"Here is the man _who_ did not make God his strength, But trusted in the abundance of his riches, _And_ strengthened himself in his [^b]wickedness." 

###### 8 
But I _am_ like a green olive tree in the house of God; I trust in the mercy of God forever and ever. 

###### 9 
I will praise You forever, Because You have done _it;_ And in the presence of Your saints I will wait on Your name, for _it_ [^c]_is_ good.

# Psalms 54

***


###### 1 
Save me, O God, by Your name, And vindicate me by Your strength. 

###### 2 
Hear my prayer, O God; Give ear to the words of my mouth. 

###### 3 
For strangers have risen up against me, And oppressors have sought after my life; They have not set God before them. <i class="selah">Selah_ 

###### 4 
Behold, God _is_ my helper; The Lord _is_ with those who [^c]uphold my life. 

###### 5 
He will repay my enemies for their evil. [^d]Cut them off in Your [^e]truth. 

###### 6 
I will freely sacrifice to You; I will praise Your name, O Lord, for _it is_ good. 

###### 7 
For He has delivered me out of all trouble; And my eye has seen _its desire_ upon my enemies. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

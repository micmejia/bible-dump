# Psalms 56

***


###### 1 
Be merciful to me, O God, for man would swallow me up; Fighting all day he oppresses me. 

###### 2 
My enemies would hound _me_ all day, For _there are_ many who fight against me, O Most High. 

###### 3 
Whenever I am afraid, I will trust in You. 

###### 4 
In God (I will praise His word), In God I have put my trust; I will not fear. What can flesh do to me? 

###### 5 
All day they twist my words; All their thoughts _are_ against me for evil. 

###### 6 
They gather together, They hide, they mark my steps, When they lie in wait for my life. 

###### 7 
Shall they escape by iniquity? In anger cast down the peoples, O God! 

###### 8 
You number my wanderings; Put my tears into Your bottle; _Are they_ not in Your book? 

###### 9 
When I cry out _to You,_ Then my enemies will turn back; This I know, because God _is_ for me. 

###### 10 
In God (I will praise _His_ word), In the Lord (I will praise _His_ word), 

###### 11 
In God I have put my trust; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me? 

###### 12 
Vows _made_ to You _are binding_ upon me, O God; I will render praises to You, 

###### 13 
For You have delivered my soul from death. _Have You_ not _kept_ my feet from falling, That I may walk before God In the light of the living?

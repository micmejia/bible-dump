# Psalms 6

***


###### 1 
O Lord, do not rebuke me in Your anger, Nor chasten me in Your hot displeasure. 

###### 2 
Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I _am_ weak; O Lord, heal me, for my bones are troubled. 

###### 3 
My soul also is greatly troubled; But You, O Lord--how long? 

###### 4 
Return, O Lord, deliver me! Oh, save me for Your mercies' sake! 

###### 5 
For in death _there is_ no remembrance of You; In the grave who will give You thanks? 

###### 6 
I am weary with my groaning; [^b]All night I make my bed swim; I drench my couch with my tears. 

###### 7 
My eye wastes away because of grief; It grows old because of all my enemies. 

###### 8 
Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity; For the Lord has heard the voice of my weeping. 

###### 9 
The Lord has heard my supplication; The Lord will receive my prayer. 

###### 10 
Let all my enemies be ashamed and greatly troubled; Let them turn back _and_ be ashamed suddenly. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Psalms 61

***


###### 1 
Hear my cry, O God; Attend to my prayer. 

###### 2 
From the end of the earth I will cry to You, When my heart is overwhelmed; Lead me to the rock that is higher than I. 

###### 3 
For You have been a shelter for me, A strong tower from the enemy. 

###### 4 
I will abide in Your [^b]tabernacle forever; I will trust in the shelter of Your wings. <i class="selah">Selah_ 

###### 5 
For You, O God, have heard my vows; You have given _me_ the heritage of those who fear Your name. 

###### 6 
You will prolong the king's life, His years as many generations. 

###### 7 
He shall abide before God forever. Oh, prepare mercy and truth, _which_ may [^c]preserve him! 

###### 8 
So I will sing praise to Your name forever, That I may daily perform my vows.

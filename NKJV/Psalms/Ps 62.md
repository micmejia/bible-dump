# Psalms 62

***


###### 1 
Truly my soul silently _waits_ for God; From Him _comes_ my salvation. 

###### 2 
He only _is_ my rock and my salvation; _He is_ my defense; I shall not be greatly moved. 

###### 3 
How long will you attack a man? You shall be slain, all of you, Like a leaning wall and a tottering fence. 

###### 4 
They only consult to cast _him_ down from his high position; They delight in lies; They bless with their mouth, But they curse inwardly. Selah_ 

###### 5 
My soul, wait silently for God alone, For my expectation _is_ from Him. 

###### 6 
He only _is_ my rock and my salvation; _He is_ my defense; I shall not be moved. 

###### 7 
In God _is_ my salvation and my glory; The rock of my strength, _And_ my refuge, _is_ in God. 

###### 8 
Trust in Him at all times, you people; Pour out your heart before Him; God _is_ a refuge for us. Selah_ 

###### 9 
Surely men of low degree _are_ a vapor, Men of high degree _are_ a lie; If they are weighed on the scales, They _are_ altogether _lighter_ than vapor. 

###### 10 
Do not trust in oppression, Nor vainly hope in robbery; If riches increase, Do not set _your_ heart _on them._ 

###### 11 
God has spoken once, Twice I have heard this: That power _belongs_ to God. 

###### 12 
Also to You, O Lord, _belongs_ mercy; For You render to each one according to his work.

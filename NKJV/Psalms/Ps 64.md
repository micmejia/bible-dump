# Psalms 64

***


###### 1 
Hear my voice, O God, in my meditation; Preserve my life from fear of the enemy. 

###### 2 
Hide me from the secret plots of the wicked, From the rebellion of the workers of iniquity, 

###### 3 
Who sharpen their tongue like a sword, And bend _their bows to shoot_ their arrows--bitter words, 

###### 4 
That they may shoot in secret at the blameless; Suddenly they shoot at him and do not fear. 

###### 5 
They encourage themselves _in_ an evil matter; They talk of laying snares secretly; They say, "Who will see them?" 

###### 6 
They devise iniquities: "We have perfected a shrewd scheme." Both the inward thought and the heart of man are deep. 

###### 7 
But God shall shoot at them _with_ an arrow; Suddenly they shall be wounded. 

###### 8 
So He will make them stumble over their own tongue; All who see them shall flee away. 

###### 9 
All men shall fear, And shall declare the work of God; For they shall wisely consider His doing. 

###### 10 
The righteous shall be glad in the Lord, and trust in Him. And all the upright in heart shall glory.

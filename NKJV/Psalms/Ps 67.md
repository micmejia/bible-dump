###### 1 
God be merciful to us and bless us, _And_ cause His face to shine upon us, <i class="selah">Selah_ 

###### 2 
That Your way may be known on earth, Your salvation among all nations. 

###### 3 
Let the peoples praise You, O God; Let all the peoples praise You. 

###### 4 
Oh, let the nations be glad and sing for joy! For You shall judge the people righteously, And govern the nations on earth. <i class="selah">Selah_ 

###### 5 
Let the peoples praise You, O God; Let all the peoples praise You. 

###### 6 
_Then_ the earth shall [^b]yield her increase; God, our own God, shall bless us. 

###### 7 
God shall bless us, And all the ends of the earth shall fear Him.

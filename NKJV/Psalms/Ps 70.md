# Psalms 70

***


###### 1 
_Make haste_, O God, to deliver me! Make haste to help me, O Lord! 

###### 2 
Let them be ashamed and confounded Who seek my life; Let them be [^a]turned back and confused Who desire my hurt. 

###### 3 
Let them be turned back because of their shame, Who say, [^b]"Aha, aha!" 

###### 4 
Let all those who seek You rejoice and be glad in You; And let those who love Your salvation say continually, "Let God be magnified!" 

###### 5 
But I _am_ poor and needy; Make haste to me, O God! You _are_ my help and my deliverer; O Lord, do not delay.

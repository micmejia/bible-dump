# Psalms 73

***


###### 1 
Truly God _is_ good to Israel, To such as are pure in heart. 

###### 2 
But as for me, my feet had almost stumbled; My steps had nearly slipped. 

###### 3 
For I _was_ envious of the boastful, When I saw the prosperity of the wicked. 

###### 4 
For _there are_ no pangs in their death, But their strength _is_ firm. 

###### 5 
They _are_ not in trouble _as other_ men, Nor are they plagued like _other_ men. 

###### 6 
Therefore pride serves as their necklace; Violence covers them _like_ a garment. 

###### 7 
Their eyes bulge with abundance; They have more than heart could wish. 

###### 8 
They scoff and speak wickedly _concerning_ oppression; They speak loftily. 

###### 9 
They set their mouth against the heavens, And their tongue walks through the earth. 

###### 10 
Therefore his people return here, And waters of a full _cup_ are drained by them. 

###### 11 
And they say, "How does God know? And is there knowledge in the Most High?" 

###### 12 
Behold, these _are_ the ungodly, Who are always at ease; They increase _in_ riches. 

###### 13 
Surely I have cleansed my heart _in_ vain, And washed my hands in innocence. 

###### 14 
For all day long I have been plagued, And chastened every morning. 

###### 15 
If I had said, "I will speak thus," Behold, I would have been untrue to the generation of Your children. 

###### 16 
When I thought _how_ to understand this, It _was_ too painful for me-- 

###### 17 
Until I went into the sanctuary of God; _Then_ I understood their end. 

###### 18 
Surely You set them in slippery places; You cast them down to destruction. 

###### 19 
Oh, how they are _brought_ to desolation, as in a moment! They are utterly consumed with terrors. 

###### 20 
As a dream when _one_ awakes, _So,_ Lord, when You awake, You shall despise their image. 

###### 21 
Thus my heart was grieved, And I was vexed in my mind. 

###### 22 
I _was_ so foolish and ignorant; I was _like_ a beast before You. 

###### 23 
Nevertheless I _am_ continually with You; You hold _me_ by my right hand. 

###### 24 
You will guide me with Your counsel, And afterward receive me _to_ glory. 

###### 25 
Whom have I in heaven _but You?_ And _there is_ none upon earth _that_ I desire besides You. 

###### 26 
My flesh and my heart fail; _But_ God _is_ the strength of my heart and my portion forever. 

###### 27 
For indeed, those who are far from You shall perish; You have destroyed all those who desert You for harlotry. 

###### 28 
But _it is_ good for me to draw near to God; I have put my trust in the Lord God, That I may declare all Your works.

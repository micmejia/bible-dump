# Psalms 76

***


###### 1 
In Judah God _is_ known; His name _is_ great in Israel. 

###### 2 
In [^b]Salem also is His tabernacle, And His dwelling place in Zion. 

###### 3 
There He broke the arrows of the bow, The shield and sword of battle. <i class="selah">Selah_ 

###### 4 
You _are_ more glorious and excellent _Than_ the mountains of prey. 

###### 5 
The stouthearted were plundered; They [^c]have sunk into their sleep; And none of the mighty men have found the use of their hands. 

###### 6 
At Your rebuke, O God of Jacob, Both the chariot and horse were cast into a dead sleep. 

###### 7 
You, Yourself, _are_ to be feared; And who may stand in Your presence When once You are angry? 

###### 8 
You caused judgment to be heard from heaven; The earth feared and was still, 

###### 9 
When God arose to judgment, To deliver all the oppressed of the earth. <i class="selah">Selah_ 

###### 10 
Surely the wrath of man shall praise You; With the remainder of wrath You shall gird Yourself. 

###### 11 
Make vows to the Lord your God, and pay _them;_ Let all who are around Him bring presents to Him who ought to be feared. 

###### 12 
He shall cut off the spirit of princes; _He is_ awesome to the kings of the earth.

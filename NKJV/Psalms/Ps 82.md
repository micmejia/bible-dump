# Psalms 82

***


###### 1 
God stands in the congregation of [^a]the mighty; He judges among the [^b]gods. 

###### 2 
How long will you judge unjustly, And show partiality to the wicked? <i class="selah">Selah_ 

###### 3 
[^c]Defend the poor and fatherless; Do justice to the afflicted and needy. 

###### 4 
Deliver the poor and needy; Free _them_ from the hand of the wicked. 

###### 5 
They do not know, nor do they understand; They walk about in darkness; All the foundations of the earth are [^d]unstable. 

###### 6 
I said, "You _are_ [^e]gods, And all of you _are_ children of the Most High. 

###### 7 
But you shall die like men, And fall like one of the princes." 

###### 8 
Arise, O God, judge the earth; For You shall inherit all nations.

"I will make mention of [^a]Rahab and Babylon to those who know Me; Behold, O Philistia and Tyre, with Ethiopia: 'This _one_ was born there.' " 

###### 5 
And of Zion it will be said, "This _one_ and that _one_ were born in her; And the Most High Himself shall establish her." 

###### 6 
The Lord will record, When He registers the peoples: "This _one_ was born there." <i class="selah">Selah_

# Psalms 87

***


###### 1 
His foundation _is_ in the holy mountains. 

###### 2 
The Lord loves the gates of Zion More than all the dwellings of Jacob. 

###### 3 
Glorious things are spoken of you, O city of God! Selah_ 

###### 4 
"I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to those who know Me; Behold, O Philistia and Tyre, with Ethiopia: 'This _one_ was born there.' " 

###### 5 
And of Zion it will be said, "This _one_ and that _one_ were born in her; And the Most High Himself shall establish her." 

###### 6 
The Lord will record, When He registers the peoples: "This _one_ was born there." Selah_ 

###### 7 
Both the singers and the players on instruments _say,_ "All my springs _are_ in you."

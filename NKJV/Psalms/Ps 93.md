# Psalms 93

***


###### 1 
The Lord reigns, He is clothed with majesty; The Lord is clothed, He has girded Himself with strength. Surely the world is established, so that it cannot be moved. 

###### 2 
Your throne _is_ established from of old; You _are_ from everlasting. 

###### 3 
The floods have lifted up, O Lord, The floods have lifted up their voice; The floods lift up their waves. 

###### 4 
The Lord on high _is_ mightier Than the noise of many waters, _Than_ the mighty waves of the sea. 

###### 5 
Your testimonies are very sure; Holiness adorns Your house, O Lord, forever.

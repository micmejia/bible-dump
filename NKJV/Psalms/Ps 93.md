# Psalms 93

***


###### 1 
The Lord reigns, He is clothed with majesty; The Lord is clothed, He has girded Himself with strength. Surely the world is established, so that it cannot be [^a]moved. 

###### 2 
Your throne _is_ established from of old; You _are_ from everlasting. 

###### 3 
The floods have [^b]lifted up, O Lord, The floods have lifted up their voice; The floods lift up their waves. 

###### 4 
The Lord on high _is_ mightier Than the noise of many waters, _Than_ the mighty waves of the sea. 

###### 5 
Your testimonies are very sure; Holiness adorns Your house, O Lord, [^c]forever. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Psalms 95

***


###### 1 
Oh come, let us sing to the Lord! Let us shout joyfully to the Rock of our salvation. 

###### 2 
Let us come before His presence with thanksgiving; Let us shout joyfully to Him with psalms. 

###### 3 
For the Lord _is_ the great God, And the great King above all gods. 

###### 4 
In His hand _are_ the deep places of the earth; The heights of the hills _are_ His also. 

###### 5 
The sea _is_ His, for He made it; And His hands formed the dry _land._ 

###### 6 
Oh come, let us worship and bow down; Let us kneel before the Lord our Maker. 

###### 7 
For He _is_ our God, And we _are_ the people of His pasture, And the sheep of His hand. Today, if you will hear His voice: 

###### 8 
"Do not harden your hearts, as in the rebellion, As _in_ the day of trial in the wilderness, 

###### 9 
When your fathers tested Me; They tried Me, though they saw My work. 

###### 10 
For forty years I was grieved with _that_ generation, And said, 'It _is_ a people who go astray in their hearts, And they do not know My ways.' 

###### 11 
So I swore in My wrath, 'They shall not enter My rest.' "

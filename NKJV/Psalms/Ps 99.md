# Psalms 99

***


###### 1 
The Lord reigns; Let the peoples tremble! He dwells _between_ the cherubim; Let the earth be [^a]moved! 

###### 2 
The Lord _is_ great in Zion, And He _is_ high above all the peoples. 

###### 3 
Let them praise Your great and awesome name-- [^b]He _is_ holy. 

###### 4 
The King's strength also loves justice; You have established equity; You have executed justice and righteousness in Jacob. 

###### 5 
Exalt the Lord our God, And worship at His footstool-- He _is_ holy. 

###### 6 
Moses and Aaron were among His priests, And Samuel was among those who called upon His name; They called upon the Lord, and He answered them. 

###### 7 
He spoke to them in the cloudy pillar; They kept His testimonies and the [^c]ordinance He gave them. 

###### 8 
You answered them, O Lord our God; You were to them God-Who-Forgives, Though You took vengeance on their deeds. 

###### 9 
Exalt the Lord our God, And worship at His holy hill; For the Lord our God _is_ holy.

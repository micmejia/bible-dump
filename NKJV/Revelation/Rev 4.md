# Revelation 4

***


###### 1 
After these things I looked, and behold, a door _standing_ open in heaven. And the first voice which I heard _was_ like a trumpet speaking with me, saying, "Come up here, and I will show you things which must take place after this." 

###### 2 
Immediately I was in the Spirit; and behold, a throne set in heaven, and _One_ sat on the throne. 

###### 3 
[^a]And He who sat there was like a jasper and a sardius stone in appearance; and _there was_ a rainbow around the throne, in appearance like an emerald. 

###### 4 
Around the throne _were_ twenty-four thrones, and on the thrones I saw twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white [^b]robes; and they had crowns of gold on their heads. 

###### 5 
And from the throne proceeded lightnings, [^c]thunderings, and voices. Seven lamps of fire _were_ burning before the throne, which are the[^d] seven Spirits of God. 

###### 6 
Before the throne _there_ [^e]_was_ a sea of glass, like crystal. And in the midst of the throne, and around the throne, _were_ four living creatures full of eyes in front and in back. 

###### 7 
The first living creature _was_ like a lion, the second living creature like a calf, the third living creature had a face like a man, and the fourth living creature _was_ like a flying eagle. 

###### 8 
_The_ four living creatures, each having six wings, were full of eyes around and within. And they do not rest day or night, saying: "Holy,[^f] holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, Who was and is and is to come!" 

###### 9 
Whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to Him who sits on the throne, who lives forever and ever, 

###### 10 
the twenty-four elders fall down before Him who sits on the throne and worship Him who lives forever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying: 

###### 11 
"You are worthy, [^g]O Lord, To receive glory and honor and power; For You created all things, And by Your will they [^h]exist and were created."

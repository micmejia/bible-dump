# Revelation 8

***


###### 1 
When He opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour. 

###### 2 
And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and to them were given seven trumpets. 

###### 3 
Then another angel, having a golden censer, came and stood at the altar. He was given much incense, that he should offer _it_ with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne. 

###### 4 
And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, ascended before God from the angel's hand. 

###### 5 
Then the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and threw _it_ to the earth. And there were noises, thunderings, lightnings, and an earthquake. 

###### 6 
So the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound. ## First Trumpet: Vegetation Struck 

###### 7 
The first angel sounded: And hail and fire followed, mingled with blood, and they were thrown to the [^a]earth. And a third of the trees were burned up, and all green grass was burned up. ## Second Trumpet: The Seas Struck 

###### 8 
Then the second angel sounded: And _something_ like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea, and a third of the sea became blood. 

###### 9 
And a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed. ## Third Trumpet: The Waters Struck 

###### 10 
Then the third angel sounded: And a great star fell from heaven, burning like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water. 

###### 11 
The name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters became wormwood, and many men died from the water, because it was made bitter. ## Fourth Trumpet: The Heavens Struck 

###### 12 
Then the fourth angel sounded: And a third of the sun was struck, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them were darkened. A third of the day [^b]did not shine, and likewise the night. 

###### 13 
And I looked, and I heard an [^c]angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, "Woe, woe, woe to the inhabitants of the earth, because of the remaining blasts of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to sound!" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

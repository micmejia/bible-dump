# Romans 13

***


###### 1 
Let every soul be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and the authorities that exist are appointed by God. 

###### 2 
Therefore whoever resists the authority resists the ordinance of God, and those who resist will [^a]bring judgment on themselves. 

###### 3 
For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil. Do you want to be unafraid of the authority? Do what is good, and you will have praise from the same. 

###### 4 
For he is God's minister to you for good. But if you do evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword in vain; for he is God's minister, an avenger to _execute_ wrath on him who practices evil. 

###### 5 
Therefore _you_ must be subject, not only because of wrath but also for conscience' sake. 

###### 6 
For because of this you also pay taxes, for they are God's ministers attending continually to this very thing. 

###### 7 
Render therefore to all their due: taxes to whom taxes _are due,_ customs to whom customs, fear to whom fear, honor to whom honor. ## Love Your Neighbor 

###### 8 
Owe no one anything except to love one another, for he who loves another has fulfilled the law. 

###### 9 
For the commandments, "You shall not commit adultery," "You shall not murder," "You shall not steal," [^b]"You shall not bear false witness," "You shall not covet," and if _there is_ any other commandment, are _all_ summed up in this saying, namely, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself." 

###### 10 
Love does no harm to a neighbor; therefore love _is_ the fulfillment of the law. ## Put on Christ 

###### 11 
And _do_ this, knowing the time, that now _it is_ high time to awake out of sleep; for now our salvation _is_ nearer than when we _first_ believed. 

###### 12 
The night is far spent, the day is at hand. Therefore let us cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light. 

###### 13 
Let us walk [^c]properly, as in the day, not in revelry and drunkenness, not in lewdness and lust, not in strife and envy. 

###### 14 
But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to _fulfill its_ lusts.

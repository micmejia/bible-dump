# Romans 14

***


###### 1 
Receive one who is weak in the faith, _but_ not to disputes over doubtful things. 

###### 2 
For one believes he may eat all things, but he who is weak eats _only_ vegetables. 

###### 3 
Let not him who eats despise him who does not eat, and let not him who does not eat judge him who eats; for God has received him. 

###### 4 
Who are you to judge another's servant? To his own master he stands or falls. Indeed, he will be made to stand, for God is able to make him stand. 

###### 5 
One person esteems _one_ day above another; another esteems every day _alike._ Let each be fully convinced in his own mind. 

###### 6 
He who observes the day, observes _it_ to the Lord; [^a]and he who does not observe the day, to the Lord he does not observe _it._ He who eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives God thanks; and he who does not eat, to the Lord he does not eat, and gives God thanks. 

###### 7 
For none of us lives to himself, and no one dies to himself. 

###### 8 
For if we live, we live to the Lord; and if we die, we die to the Lord. Therefore, whether we live or die, we are the Lord's. 

###### 9 
For to this end Christ died [^b]and rose and lived again, that He might be Lord of both the dead and the living. 

###### 10 
But why do you judge your brother? Or why do you show contempt for your brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of [^c]Christ. 

###### 11 
For it is written: "_As_ I live, says the Lord, Every knee shall bow to Me, And every tongue shall confess to God." 

###### 12 
So then each of us shall give account of himself to God. 

###### 13 
Therefore let us not judge one another [^d]anymore, but rather resolve this, not to put a stumbling block or a cause to fall in _our_ brother's way. ## The Law of Love 

###### 14 
I know and am convinced by the Lord Jesus that _there is_ nothing unclean of itself; but to him who considers anything to be unclean, to him _it is_ unclean. 

###### 15 
Yet if your brother is grieved because of _your_ food, you are no longer walking in love. Do not destroy with your food the one for whom Christ died. 

###### 16 
Therefore do not let your good be spoken of as evil; 

###### 17 
for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. 

###### 18 
For he who serves Christ in [^e]these things _is_ acceptable to God and approved by men. 

###### 19 
Therefore let us pursue the things _which make_ for peace and the things by which one may [^f]edify another. 

###### 20 
Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. All things indeed _are_ pure, but _it is_ evil for the man who eats with [^g]offense. 

###### 21 
_It is_ good neither to eat meat nor drink wine nor _do anything_ by which your brother stumbles [^h]or is offended or is made weak. 

###### 22 
[^i]Do you have faith? Have _it_ to yourself before God. Happy _is_ he who does not condemn himself in what he approves. 

###### 23 
But he who doubts is condemned if he eats, because _he does_ not _eat_ from faith; for whatever _is_ not from faith is [^j]sin.

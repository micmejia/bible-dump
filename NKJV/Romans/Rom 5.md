# Romans 5

***


###### 1 
Therefore, having been justified by faith, [^a]we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, 

###### 2 
through whom also we have access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. 

###### 3 
And not only _that,_ but we also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces [^b]perseverance; 

###### 4 
and perseverance, [^c]character; and character, hope. 

###### 5 
Now hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us. ## Christ in Our Place 

###### 6 
For when we were still without strength, [^d]in due time Christ died for the ungodly. 

###### 7 
For scarcely for a righteous man will one die; yet perhaps for a good man someone would even dare to die. 

###### 8 
But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. 

###### 9 
Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him. 

###### 10 
For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life. 

###### 11 
And not only _that,_ but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation. ## Death in Adam, Life in Christ 

###### 12 
Therefore, just as through one man sin entered the world, and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men, because all sinned-- 

###### 13 
(For until the law sin was in the world, but sin is not imputed when there is no law. 

###### 14 
Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who had not sinned according to the likeness of the transgression of Adam, who is a type of Him who was to come. 

###### 15 
But the free gift _is_ not like the [^e]offense. For if by the one man's offense many died, much more the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one Man, Jesus Christ, abounded to many. 

###### 16 
And the gift _is_ not like _that which came_ through the one who sinned. For the judgment _which came_ from one _offense resulted_ in condemnation, but the free gift _which came_ from many [^f]offenses _resulted_ in justification. 

###### 17 
For if by the one man's [^g]offense death reigned through the one, much more those who receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.) 

###### 18 
Therefore, as through [^h]one man's offense _judgment came_ to all men, resulting in condemnation, even so through one[^i] Man's righteous act _the free gift came_ to all men, resulting in justification of life. 

###### 19 
For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so also by one Man's obedience many will be made righteous. 

###### 20 
Moreover the law entered that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace abounded much more, 

###### 21 
so that as sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

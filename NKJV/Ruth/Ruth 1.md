# Ruth 1

***


###### 1 
Now it came to pass, in the days when the judges [^a]ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehem, Judah, went to [^b]dwell in the country of Moab, he and his wife and his two sons. 

###### 2 
The name of the man _was_ Elimelech, the name of his wife _was_ Naomi, and the names of his two sons _were_ Mahlon and Chilion--Ephrathites of Bethlehem, Judah. And they went to the country of Moab and remained there. 

###### 3 
Then Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died; and she was left, and her two sons. 

###### 4 
Now they took wives of the women of Moab: the name of the one _was_ Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth. And they [^c]dwelt there about ten years. 

###### 5 
Then both Mahlon and Chilion also died; so the woman survived her two sons and her husband. ## Naomi Returns with Ruth 

###### 6 
Then she arose with her daughters-in-law that she might return from the country of Moab, for she had heard in the country of Moab that the Lord had visited[^d] His people by giving them bread. 

###### 7 
Therefore she went out from the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah. 

###### 8 
And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, "Go, return each to her mother's house. The Lord deal kindly with you, as you have dealt with the dead and with me. 

###### 9 
The Lord grant that you may find rest, each in the house of her husband." So she kissed them, and they lifted up their voices and wept. 

###### 10 
And they said to her, "Surely we will return with you to your people." 

###### 11 
But Naomi said, "Turn back, my daughters; why will you go with me? _Are_ there still sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands? 

###### 12 
Turn back, my daughters, go--for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say I have hope, _if_ I should have a husband tonight and should also bear sons, 

###### 13 
would you wait for them till they were grown? Would you restrain yourselves from having husbands? No, my daughters; for it grieves me very much for your sakes that the hand of the Lord has gone out against me!" 

###### 14 
Then they lifted up their voices and wept again; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her. 

###### 15 
And she said, "Look, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods; return after your sister-in-law." 

###### 16 
But Ruth said: "Entreat[^e] me not to leave you, _Or to_ turn back from following after you; For wherever you go, I will go; And wherever you lodge, I will lodge; Your people _shall be_ my people, And your God, my God. 

###### 17 
Where you die, I will die, And there will I be buried. The Lord do so to me, and more also, If _anything but_ death parts you and me." 

###### 18 
When she saw that she [^f]was determined to go with her, she stopped speaking to her. 

###### 19 
Now the two of them went until they came to Bethlehem. And it happened, when they had come to Bethlehem, that all the city was excited because of them; and the women said, "_Is_ this Naomi?" 

###### 20 
But she said to them, "Do not call me [^g]Naomi; call me [^h]Mara, for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me. 

###### 21 
I went out full, and the Lord has brought me home again empty. Why do you call me Naomi, since the Lord has testified against me, and [^i]the Almighty has afflicted me?" 

###### 22 
So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess her daughter-in-law with her, who returned from the country of Moab. Now they came to Bethlehem at the beginning of barley harvest. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

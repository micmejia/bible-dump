# Song of Solomon 1

***


###### 1 
The song of songs, which _is_ Solomon's. ## The Banquet 

###### 2 
Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth-- For [^b]your love _is_ better than wine. 

###### 3 
Because of the fragrance of your good ointments, Your name _is_ ointment poured forth; Therefore the virgins love you. 

###### 4 
Draw me away! We will run after [^c]you. The king has brought me into his chambers. We will be glad and rejoice in [^d]you. We will remember your love more than wine. Rightly do they love you. 

###### 5 
I _am_ dark, but lovely, O daughters of Jerusalem, Like the tents of Kedar, Like the curtains of Solomon. 

###### 6 
Do not look upon me, because I _am_ dark, Because the sun has [^e]tanned me. My mother's sons were angry with me; They made me the keeper of the vineyards, _But_ my own vineyard I have not kept. 

###### 7 
Tell me, O you whom I love, Where you feed _your flock,_ Where you make _it_ rest at noon. For why should I be as one who [^f]veils herself By the flocks of your companions? 

###### 8 
If you do not know, O fairest among women, [^g]Follow in the footsteps of the flock, And feed your little goats Beside the shepherds' tents. 

###### 9 
I have compared you, my love, To my filly among Pharaoh's chariots. 

###### 10 
Your cheeks are lovely with ornaments, Your neck with chains _of gold._ 

###### 11 
We will make [^h]you ornaments of gold With studs of silver. 

###### 12 
While the king _is_ at his table, My [^i]spikenard sends forth its fragrance. 

###### 13 
A bundle of myrrh _is_ my beloved to me, That lies all night between my breasts. 

###### 14 
My beloved _is_ to me a cluster of henna _blooms_ In the vineyards of En Gedi. 

###### 15 
Behold, you _are_ fair, [^j]my love! Behold, you _are_ fair! You _have_ dove's eyes. 

###### 16 
Behold, you _are_ handsome, my beloved! Yes, pleasant! Also our [^k]bed _is_ green. 

###### 17 
The beams of our houses _are_ cedar, _And_ our rafters of fir.

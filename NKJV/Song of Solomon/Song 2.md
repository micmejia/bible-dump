# Song of Solomon 2

***


###### 1 
I _am_ the rose of Sharon, _And_ the lily of the valleys. 

###### 2 
Like a lily among thorns, So is my love among the daughters. 

###### 3 
Like an apple tree among the trees of the woods, So _is_ my beloved among the sons. I sat down in his shade with great delight, And his fruit _was_ sweet to my taste. 

###### 4 
He brought me to the [^a]banqueting house, And his banner over me _was_ love. 

###### 5 
Sustain me with cakes of raisins, Refresh me with apples, For I _am_ lovesick. 

###### 6 
His left hand _is_ under my head, And his right hand embraces me. 

###### 7 
I [^b]charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, By the gazelles or by the does of the field, Do not stir up nor awaken love Until it pleases. ## The Beloved's Request 

###### 8 
The voice of my beloved! Behold, he comes Leaping upon the mountains, Skipping upon the hills. 

###### 9 
My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag. Behold, he stands behind our wall; He is looking through the windows, Gazing through the lattice. 

###### 10 
My beloved spoke, and said to me: "Rise up, my love, my fair one, And come away. 

###### 11 
For lo, the winter is past, The rain is over _and_ gone. 

###### 12 
The flowers appear on the earth; The time of singing has come, And the voice of the turtledove Is heard in our land. 

###### 13 
The fig tree puts forth her green figs, And the vines _with_ the tender grapes Give a _good_ smell. Rise up, my love, my fair one, And come away! 

###### 14 
"O my dove, in the clefts of the rock, In the secret _places_ of the cliff, Let me see your [^c]face, Let me hear your voice; For your voice _is_ sweet, And your face _is_ lovely." 

###### 15 
Catch us the foxes, The little foxes that spoil the vines, For our vines _have_ tender grapes. 

###### 16 
My beloved _is_ mine, and I _am_ his. He feeds _his flock_ among the lilies. 

###### 17 
Until the day breaks And the shadows flee away, Turn, my beloved, And be like a gazelle Or a young stag Upon the mountains of [^d]Bether.

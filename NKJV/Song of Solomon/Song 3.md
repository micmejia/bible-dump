# Song of Solomon 3

***


###### 1 
By night on my bed I sought the one I love; I sought him, but I did not find him. 

###### 2 
"I will rise now," _I said,_ "And go about the city; In the streets and in the squares I will seek the one I love." I sought him, but I did not find him. 

###### 3 
The watchmen who go about the city found me; _I said,_ "Have you seen the one I love?" 

###### 4 
Scarcely had I passed by them, When I found the one I love. I held him and would not let him go, Until I had brought him to the house of my mother, And into the chamber of her who conceived me. 

###### 5 
I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, By the gazelles or by the does of the field, Do not stir up nor awaken love Until it pleases. ## The Coming of Solomon 

###### 6 
Who _is_ this coming out of the wilderness Like pillars of smoke, Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, With all the merchant's fragrant powders? 

###### 7 
Behold, it _is_ Solomon's couch, _With_ sixty valiant men around it, Of the valiant of Israel. 

###### 8 
They all hold swords, _Being_ expert in war. Every man _has_ his sword on his thigh Because of fear in the night. 

###### 9 
Of the wood of Lebanon Solomon the King Made himself a palanquin: 

###### 10 
He made its pillars _of_ silver, Its support _of_ gold, Its seat _of_ purple, Its interior paved _with_ love By the daughters of Jerusalem. 

###### 11 
Go forth, O daughters of Zion, And see King Solomon with the crown With which his mother crowned him On the day of his wedding, The day of the gladness of his heart.

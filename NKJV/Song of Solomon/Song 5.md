# Song of Solomon 5

***


###### 1 
I have come to my garden, my sister, _my_ spouse; I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, O friends! Drink, yes, drink deeply, O beloved ones! ## The Shulamite's Troubled Evening 

###### 2 
I sleep, but my heart is awake; _It is_ the voice of my beloved! He knocks, _saying,_ "Open for me, my sister, my love, My dove, my perfect one; For my head is covered with dew, My locks with the drops of the night." 

###### 3 
I have taken off my robe; How can I put it on _again?_ I have washed my feet; How can I defile them? 

###### 4 
My beloved put his hand By the latch _of the door,_ And my heart yearned for him. 

###### 5 
I arose to open for my beloved, And my hands dripped _with_ myrrh, My fingers with liquid myrrh, On the handles of the lock. 

###### 6 
I opened for my beloved, But my beloved had turned away _and_ was gone. My heart leaped up when he spoke. I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer. 

###### 7 
The watchmen who went about the city found me. They struck me, they wounded me; The keepers of the walls Took my veil away from me. 

###### 8 
I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, If you find my beloved, That you tell him I _am_ lovesick! 

###### 9 
What _is_ your beloved More than _another_ beloved, O fairest among women? What _is_ your beloved More than _another_ beloved, That you so charge us? 

###### 10 
My beloved _is_ white and ruddy, Chief among ten thousand. 

###### 11 
His head _is like_ the finest gold; His locks _are_ wavy, _And_ black as a raven. 

###### 12 
His eyes _are_ like doves By the rivers of waters, Washed with milk, _And_ fitly set. 

###### 13 
His cheeks _are_ like a bed of spices, Banks of scented herbs. His lips _are_ lilies, Dripping liquid myrrh. 

###### 14 
His hands _are_ rods of gold Set with beryl. His body _is_ carved ivory Inlaid _with_ sapphires. 

###### 15 
His legs _are_ pillars of marble Set on bases of fine gold. His countenance _is_ like Lebanon, Excellent as the cedars. 

###### 16 
His mouth _is_ most sweet, Yes, he _is_ altogether lovely. This _is_ my beloved, And this _is_ my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem!

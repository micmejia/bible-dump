# Song of Solomon 6

***


###### 1 
Where has your beloved gone, O fairest among women? Where has your beloved turned aside, That we may seek him with you? 

###### 2 
My beloved has gone to his garden, To the beds of spices, To feed _his flock_ in the gardens, And to gather lilies. 

###### 3 
I _am_ my beloved's, And my beloved _is_ mine. He feeds _his flock_ among the lilies.

## Praise of the Shulamite's Beauty 

###### 4 
O my love, you _are as_ beautiful as Tirzah, Lovely as Jerusalem, Awesome as _an army_ with banners! 

###### 5 
Turn your eyes away from me, For they have overcome me. Your hair _is_ like a flock of goats Going down from Gilead. 

###### 6 
Your teeth _are_ like a flock of sheep Which have come up from the washing; Every one bears twins, And none _is_ barren among them. 

###### 7 
Like a piece of pomegranate _Are_ your temples behind your veil. 

###### 8 
There are sixty queens And eighty concubines, And virgins without number. 

###### 9 
My dove, my perfect one, Is the only one, The only one of her mother, The favorite of the one who bore her. The daughters saw her And called her blessed, The queens and the concubines, And they praised her. 

###### 10 
Who is she who looks forth as the morning, Fair as the moon, Clear as the sun, Awesome as _an army_ with banners? 

###### 11 
I went down to the garden of nuts To see the verdure of the valley, To see whether the vine had budded _And_ the pomegranates had bloomed. 

###### 12 
Before I was even aware, My soul had made me _As_ the chariots of my noble people. 

###### 13 
Return, return, O Shulamite; Return, return, that we may look upon you! What would you see in the Shulamite-- As it were, the dance of the two camps?

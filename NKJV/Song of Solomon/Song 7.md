# Song of Solomon 7

***


###### 1 
How beautiful are your feet in sandals, O prince's daughter! The curves of your thighs _are_ like jewels, The work of the hands of a skillful workman. 

###### 2 
Your navel _is_ a rounded goblet; It lacks no blended beverage. Your waist _is_ a heap of wheat Set about with lilies. 

###### 3 
Your two breasts _are_ like two fawns, Twins of a gazelle. 

###### 4 
Your neck _is_ like an ivory tower, Your eyes _like_ the pools in Heshbon By the gate of Bath Rabbim. Your nose _is_ like the tower of Lebanon Which looks toward Damascus. 

###### 5 
Your head _crowns_ you like _Mount_ Carmel, And the hair of your head _is_ like purple; A king _is_ held captive by _your_ tresses. 

###### 6 
How fair and how pleasant you are, O love, with your delights! 

###### 7 
This stature of yours is like a palm tree, And your breasts _like_ its clusters. 

###### 8 
I said, "I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of its branches." Let now your breasts be like clusters of the vine, The fragrance of your breath like apples, 

###### 9 
And the roof of your mouth like the best wine. _The wine_ goes _down_ smoothly for my beloved, Moving gently the lips of sleepers. 

###### 10 
I _am_ my beloved's, And his desire _is_ toward me. 

###### 11 
Come, my beloved, Let us go forth to the field; Let us lodge in the villages. 

###### 12 
Let us get up early to the vineyards; Let us see if the vine has budded, _Whether_ the grape blossoms are open, _And_ the pomegranates are in bloom. There I will give you my love. 

###### 13 
The mandrakes give off a fragrance, And at our gates _are_ pleasant _fruits,_ All manner, new and old, Which I have laid up for you, my beloved.

# Song of Solomon 8

***


###### 1 
Oh, that you were like my brother, Who nursed at my mother's breasts! _If_ I should find you outside, I would kiss you; I would not be despised. 

###### 2 
I would lead you _and_ bring you Into the house of my mother, She _who_ used to instruct me. I would cause you to drink of spiced wine, Of the juice of my pomegranate. 

###### 3 
His left hand _is_ under my head, And his right hand embraces me. 

###### 4 
I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, Do not stir up nor awaken love Until it pleases.

## Love Renewed in Lebanon 

###### 5 
Who _is_ this coming up from the wilderness, Leaning upon her beloved? I awakened you under the apple tree. There your mother brought you forth; There she _who_ bore you brought _you_ forth. 

###### 6 
Set me as a seal upon your heart, As a seal upon your arm; For love _is as_ strong as death, Jealousy _as_ cruel as the grave; Its flames _are_ flames of fire, A most vehement flame. 

###### 7 
Many waters cannot quench love, Nor can the floods drown it. If a man would give for love All the wealth of his house, It would be utterly despised. 

###### 8 
We have a little sister, And she has no breasts. What shall we do for our sister In the day when she is spoken for? 

###### 9 
If she _is_ a wall, We will build upon her A battlement of silver; And if she _is_ a door, We will enclose her With boards of cedar. 

###### 10 
I _am_ a wall, And my breasts like towers; Then I became in his eyes As one who found peace. 

###### 11 
Solomon had a vineyard at Baal Hamon; He leased the vineyard to keepers; Everyone was to bring for its fruit A thousand silver _coins_. 

###### 12 
My own vineyard _is_ before me. You, O Solomon, _may have_ a thousand, And those who tend its fruit two hundred. 

###### 13 
You who dwell in the gardens, The companions listen for your voice-- Let me hear it! 

###### 14 
Make haste, my beloved, And be like a gazelle Or a young stag On the mountains of spices.

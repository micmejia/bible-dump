# Titus 2

***


###### 1 
But as for you, speak the things which are proper for sound doctrine: 

###### 2 
that the older men be sober, reverent, temperate, sound in faith, in love, in patience; 

###### 3 
the older women likewise, that they be reverent in behavior, not slanderers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things-- 

###### 4 
that they admonish the young women to love their husbands, to love their children, 

###### 5 
_to be_ discreet, chaste, homemakers, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be blasphemed. 

###### 6 
Likewise, exhort the young men to be sober-minded, 

###### 7 
in all things showing yourself _to be_ a pattern of good works; in doctrine _showing_ integrity, reverence, incorruptibility,[^a] 

###### 8 
sound speech that cannot be condemned, that one who is an opponent may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say of [^b]you. 

###### 9 
_Exhort_ bondservants to be obedient to their own masters, to be well pleasing in all _things,_ not answering back, 

###### 10 
not [^c]pilfering, but showing all good [^d]fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things. ## Trained by Saving Grace 

###### 11 
For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men, 

###### 12 
teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in the present age, 

###### 13 
looking for the blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, 

###### 14 
who gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from every lawless deed and purify for Himself _His_ own special people, zealous for good works. 

###### 15 
Speak these things, exhort, and rebuke with all authority.

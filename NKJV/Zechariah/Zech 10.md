# Zechariah 10

***


###### 1 
Ask the Lord for rain In the time of the [^a]latter rain. The Lord will make [^b]flashing clouds; He will give them showers of rain, Grass in the field for everyone. 

###### 2 
For the idols[^c] speak delusion; The diviners envision lies, And tell false dreams; They comfort in vain. Therefore _the people_ wend their way like sheep; They are [^d]in trouble because _there is_ no shepherd. 

###### 3 
"My anger is kindled against the shepherds, And I will punish the [^e]goatherds. For the Lord of hosts will visit His flock, The house of Judah, And will make them as His royal horse in the battle. 

###### 4 
From him comes the cornerstone, From him the tent peg, From him the battle bow, From him every [^f]ruler together. 

###### 5 
They shall be like mighty men, Who tread down _their enemies_ In the mire of the streets in the battle. They shall fight because the Lord is with them, And the riders on horses shall be put to shame. 

###### 6 
"I will strengthen the house of Judah, And I will save the house of Joseph. I will bring them back, Because I have mercy on them. They shall be as though I had not cast them aside; For I _am_ the Lord their God, And I will hear them. 

###### 7 
_Those of_ Ephraim shall be like a mighty man, And their heart shall rejoice as if with wine. Yes, their children shall see _it_ and be glad; Their heart shall rejoice in the Lord. 

###### 8 
I will whistle for them and gather them, For I will redeem them; And they shall increase as they once increased. 

###### 9 
"I will [^g]sow them among the peoples, And they shall remember Me in far countries; They shall live, together with their children, And they shall return. 

###### 10 
I will also bring them back from the land of Egypt, And gather them from Assyria. I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon, Until no _more room_ is found for them. 

###### 11 
He shall pass through the sea with affliction, And strike the waves of the sea: All the depths of [^h]the River shall dry up. Then the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, And the scepter of Egypt shall depart. 

###### 12 
"So I will strengthen them in the Lord, And they shall walk up and down in His name," Says the Lord.

# Zechariah 14

***


###### 1 
Behold, the day of the Lord is coming, And your [^a]spoil will be divided in your midst. 

###### 2 
For I will gather all the nations to battle against Jerusalem; The city shall be taken, The houses [^b]rifled, And the women ravished. Half of the city shall go into captivity, But the remnant of the people shall not be cut off from the city. 

###### 3 
Then the Lord will go forth And fight against those nations, As He fights in the day of battle. 

###### 4 
And in that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, Which faces Jerusalem on the east. And the Mount of Olives shall be split in two, From east to west, _Making_ a very large valley; Half of the mountain shall move toward the north And half of it toward the south. 

###### 5 
Then you shall flee _through_ My mountain valley, For the mountain valley shall reach to Azal. Yes, you shall flee As you fled from the earthquake In the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Thus the Lord my God will come, _And_ all the saints with [^c]You. 

###### 6 
It shall come to pass in that day _That_ there will be no light; The [^d]lights will diminish. 

###### 7 
It shall be one day Which is known to the Lord-- Neither day nor night. But at evening time it shall happen _That_ it will be light. 

###### 8 
And in that day it shall be _That_ living waters shall flow from Jerusalem, Half of them toward [^e]the eastern sea And half of them toward [^f]the western sea; In both summer and winter it shall occur. 

###### 9 
And the Lord shall be King over all the earth. In that day it shall be-- "The Lord _is_ one," And His name one. 

###### 10 
All the land shall be turned into a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem. [^g]_Jerusalem_ shall be raised up and inhabited in her place from Benjamin's Gate to the place of the First Gate and the Corner Gate, and _from_ the Tower of Hananel to the king's winepresses. 

###### 11 
_The people_ shall dwell in it; And no longer shall there be utter destruction, But Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited. 

###### 12 
And this shall be the plague with which the Lord will strike all the people who fought against Jerusalem: Their flesh shall [^h]dissolve while they stand on their feet, Their eyes shall dissolve in their sockets, And their tongues shall dissolve in their mouths. 

###### 13 
It shall come to pass in that day _That_ a great panic from the Lord will be among them. Everyone will seize the hand of his neighbor, And raise his hand against his neighbor's hand; 

###### 14 
Judah also will fight at Jerusalem. And the wealth of all the surrounding nations Shall be gathered together: Gold, silver, and apparel in great abundance. 

###### 15 
Such also shall be the plague On the horse _and_ the mule, On the camel and the donkey, And on all the cattle that will be in those camps. So _shall_ this plague _be._ ## The Nations Worship the King 

###### 16 
And it shall come to pass _that_ everyone who is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall go up from year to year to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, and to keep the Feast of Tabernacles. 

###### 17 
And it shall be _that_ whichever of the families of the earth do not come up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, on them there will be no rain. 

###### 18 
If the family of Egypt will not come up and enter in, they _shall have_ no _rain;_ they shall receive the plague with which the Lord strikes the nations who do not come up to keep the Feast of Tabernacles. 

###### 19 
This shall be the [^i]punishment of Egypt and the punishment of all the nations that do not come up to keep the Feast of Tabernacles. 

###### 20 
In that day "HOLINESS TO THE LORD" shall be _engraved_ on the bells of the horses. The pots in the Lord's house shall be like the bowls before the altar. 

###### 21 
Yes, [^j]every pot in Jerusalem and Judah shall be holiness to the Lord of hosts. Everyone who sacrifices shall come and take them and cook in them. In that day there shall no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the Lord of hosts.

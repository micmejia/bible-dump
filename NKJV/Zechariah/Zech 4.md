# Zechariah 4

***


###### 1 
Now the angel who talked with me came back and wakened me, as a man who is wakened out of his sleep. 

###### 2 
And he said to me, "What do you see?" So I said, "I am looking, and there _is_ a lampstand of solid gold with a bowl on top of it, and on the _stand_ seven lamps with seven pipes to the seven lamps. 

###### 3 
Two olive trees _are_ by it, one at the right of the bowl and the other at its left." 

###### 4 
So I answered and spoke to the angel who talked with me, saying, "What _are_ these, my lord?" 

###### 5 
Then the angel who talked with me answered and said to me, "Do you not know what these are?" And I said, "No, my lord." 

###### 6 
So he answered and said to me: "This _is_ the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel: 'Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,' Says the Lord of hosts. 

###### 7 
'Who _are_ you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel _you shall become_ a plain! And he shall bring forth the capstone With shouts of "Grace, grace to it!" ' " 

###### 8 
Moreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying: 

###### 9 
"The hands of Zerubbabel Have laid the foundation of this temple; His hands shall also finish _it._ Then you will know That the Lord of hosts has sent Me to you. 

###### 10 
For who has despised the day of small things? For these seven rejoice to see The plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel. They are the eyes of the Lord, Which scan to and fro throughout the whole earth." 

###### 11 
Then I answered and said to him, "What _are_ these two olive trees--at the right of the lampstand and at its left?" 

###### 12 
And I further answered and said to him, "What _are these_ two olive branches that _drip_ into the receptacles of the two gold pipes from which the golden _oil_ drains?" 

###### 13 
Then he answered me and said, "Do you not know what these _are?_" And I said, "No, my lord." 

###### 14 
So he said, "These _are_ the two anointed ones, who stand beside the Lord of the whole earth."

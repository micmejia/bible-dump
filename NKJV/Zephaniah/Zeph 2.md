# Zephaniah 2

***


###### 1 
Gather yourselves together, yes, gather together, O [^a]undesirable nation, 

###### 2 
Before the decree is issued, _Or_ the day passes like chaff, Before the Lord's fierce anger comes upon you, Before the day of the Lord's anger comes upon you! 

###### 3 
Seek the Lord, all you meek of the earth, Who have upheld His justice. Seek righteousness, seek humility. It may be that you will be hidden In the day of the Lord's anger. ## Judgment on Nations 

###### 4 
For Gaza shall be forsaken, And Ashkelon desolate; They shall drive out Ashdod at noonday, And Ekron shall be uprooted. 

###### 5 
Woe to the inhabitants of the seacoast, The nation of the Cherethites! The word of the Lord _is_ against you, O Canaan, land of the Philistines: "I will destroy you; So there shall be no inhabitant." 

###### 6 
The seacoast shall be pastures, With [^b]shelters for shepherds and folds for flocks. 

###### 7 
The coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; They shall feed _their_ flocks there; In the houses of Ashkelon they shall lie down at evening. For the Lord their God will intervene[^c] for them, And return their captives. 

###### 8 
"I have heard the reproach of Moab, And the insults of the people of Ammon, With which they have reproached My people, And made arrogant threats against their borders. 

###### 9 
Therefore, as I live," Says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, "Surely Moab shall be like Sodom, And the people of Ammon like Gomorrah-- Overrun[^d] with weeds and saltpits, And a [^e]perpetual desolation. The residue of My people shall plunder them, And the remnant of My people shall possess them." 

###### 10 
This they shall have for their pride, Because they have reproached and made arrogant threats Against the people of the Lord of hosts. 

###### 11 
The Lord _will be_ awesome to them, For He will reduce to nothing all the gods of the earth; _People_ shall worship Him, Each one from his place, Indeed all the shores of the nations. 

###### 12 
"You Ethiopians also, You shall be slain by My sword." 

###### 13 
And He will stretch out His hand against the north, Destroy Assyria, And make Nineveh a desolation, As dry as the wilderness. 

###### 14 
The herds shall lie down in her midst, Every beast of the nation. Both the pelican and the bittern Shall lodge on the capitals _of_ her _pillars;_ Their voice shall sing in the windows; Desolation _shall be_ at the threshold; For He will lay bare the cedar work. 

###### 15 
This is the rejoicing city That dwelt securely, That said in her heart, "I _am it,_ and _there is_ none besides me." How has she become a desolation, A place for beasts to lie down! Everyone who passes by her Shall hiss and shake his fist.

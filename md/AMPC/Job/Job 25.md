# Job 25

***


###### 1 


Then Bildad the Shuhite answered, 


###### 2 


Dominion and fear are with [God]; He makes peace in His high places. 


###### 3 


Is there any number to His armies? And upon whom does not His light arise? 


###### 4 


How then can man be justified and righteous before God? Or how can he who is born of a woman be pure and clean? 


###### 5 


Behold, even the moon has no brightness [compared to God's glory] and the stars are not pure in His sight-- 


###### 6 


How much less man, who is a maggot! And a son of man, who is a worm!

# Psalms 14

***


###### 1 


The [empty-headed] fool has said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable deeds; there is none that does good or right. 


###### 2 


The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men to see if there were any who understood, dealt wisely, and sought after God, inquiring for and of Him and requiring Him [of vital necessity]. 


###### 3 


They are all gone aside, they have all together become filthy; there is none that does good or right, no, not one. 


###### 4 


Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge, who eat up my people as they eat bread and who do not call on the Lord? 


###### 5 


There they shall be in great fear [literally--dreading a dread], for God is with the generation of the [uncompromisingly] righteous (those upright and in right standing with Him). 


###### 6 


You [evildoers] would put to shame and confound the plans of the poor and patient, but the Lord is his safe refuge. 


###### 7 


Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion! When the Lord shall restore the fortunes of His people, then Jacob shall rejoice and Israel shall be glad.

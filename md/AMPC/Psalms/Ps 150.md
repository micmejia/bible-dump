# Psalms 150

***


###### 1 


Praise the Lord! Praise God in His sanctuary; praise Him in the heavens of His power! 


###### 2 


Praise Him for His mighty acts; praise Him according to the abundance of His greatness! 


###### 3 


Praise Him with trumpet sound; praise Him with lute and harp! 


###### 4 


Praise Him with tambourine and [single or group] dance; praise Him with stringed and wind instruments or flutes! 


###### 5 


Praise Him with resounding cymbals; praise Him with loud clashing cymbals! 


###### 6 


Let everything that has breath and every breath of life praise the Lord! Praise the Lord! (Hallelujah!)

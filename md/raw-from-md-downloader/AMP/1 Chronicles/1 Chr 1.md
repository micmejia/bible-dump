[^b]: 1 Chronicles 1:7 In Gen 10:4 _Dodanim_. [^c]: 1 Chronicles 1:11 There are numerous variations in the spelling of some of the Hebrew names. In some cases an alternate spelling is given in parentheses or a footnote may be added for clarity. In general, one spelling is given for each name. [^d]: 1 Chronicles 1:32 See note Gen 22:24. [^e]: 1 Chronicles 1:43 In general, _sons of Israel_ or _Israel_ or _Israelites_ refers to all the people (males and females) of the various tribes descended from the twelve sons (Gen 35:23-26) of Jacob (later renamed Israel by God). In verses concerning things such as warfare or circumcision _sons of Israel_ or _Israel_ or _Israelites_ usually refers only to the males. Tribes of ancient people were identified by the name of their founding ancestor. Therefore, this same general rule applies when referring to individual tribal groups, e.g. _sons of Reuben, Reuben, Reubenites_ and so throughout.

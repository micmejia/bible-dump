[^b]: 1 Chronicles 25:2 Control over prophecy is later affirmed by Paul (1 Cor 14:32); i.e. a prophet is not overcome by the Spirit to the point that he cannot control his actions. He can, for example, refrain from speaking, and in this case Asaph did not prophesy until ordered or given permission to do so by the king. [^c]: 1 Chronicles 25:2 Lit _hand_. [^d]: 1 Chronicles 25:5 Lit _lift up the horn_.

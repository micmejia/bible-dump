# 1 Chronicles 5

***
















###### 1 







Now [we come to] the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel--for Reuben was the eldest, but because he defiled his father's bed [with Bilhah his father's [^a]concubine], his birthright was given to [Manasseh and Ephraim] the sons of Joseph [the favorite] son of Israel, so that he is not enrolled in the genealogy according to the birthright. 















###### 2 







Though Judah prevailed over his brothers, and from him came [David] the leader [and eventually the Messiah], yet the birthright was Joseph's-- 















###### 3 







the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. 















###### 4 







The sons of Joel: Shemaiah his son, Gog his son, Shimei his son, 















###### 5 







Micah his son, Reaiah his son, Baal his son, 















###### 6 







Beerah his son, whom Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria carried away into exile; he was a leader of the tribe of Reuben. 















###### 7 







And his brothers (relatives) by their families, in the genealogy of their generations, were the chief Jeiel, and Zechariah, 















###### 8 







Bela the son of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of Joel, who lived in Aroer as far as Nebo and Baal-meon. 















###### 9 







To the east Bela settled as far as the entrance into the desert from the river Euphrates, because their cattle had multiplied in the land of Gilead. 















###### 10 







In the days of King Saul they made war with the [^b]Hagrites, who fell by their hands; and they lived in their tents throughout all the land east of Gilead. ## Descendants of Gad 















###### 11 







The sons of Gad lived opposite them in the land of Bashan, as far as Salecah: 















###### 12 







Joel was the chief, Shapham the second, then Janai and Shaphat in Bashan. 















###### 13 







Their relatives from the households of their fathers: Michael, Meshullam, Sheba, Jorai, Jacan, Zia, and Eber--seven _in all_. 















###### 14 







These were the sons of Abihail the son of Huri, the son of Jaroah, the son of Gilead, the son of Michael, the son of Jeshishai, the son of Jahdo, the son of Buz; 















###### 15 







Ahi the son of Abdiel, the son of Guni, was chief in their fathers' households. 















###### 16 







They lived in Gilead, in Bashan and in its towns, and in all the [surrounding] pasture lands of Sharon, as far as their borders. 















###### 17 







All these were enrolled in the genealogies in the days of Jotham king of Judah and in the days of Jeroboam [II] king of Israel. 















###### 18 







The sons of Reuben, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh--valiant men able to bear shield and sword, and to shoot with the bow, and skillful in war--were 44,760 who went to war. 















###### 19 







And these Israelites, [on the east side of the Jordan River] made war with the Hagrites [a tribe of northern Arabia], Jetur, Naphish, and Nodab. 















###### 20 







They were given help against them, and the Hagrites were handed over to them, and all who were _allied_ with them; for they cried out to God [for help] in the battle; and He granted their entreaty because they relied on _and_ trusted in Him. 















###### 21 







These Israelites took away their livestock: their 50,000 camels, and 250,000 sheep, and 2,000 donkeys; and 100,000 [^c]people. 















###### 22 







For a great number fell mortally wounded, because the battle was of God. And these Israelites settled in their territory until the exile [by Assyria more than five centuries later]. ## Descendants of Manasseh 















###### 23 







Now the sons (people) of the half-tribe of Manasseh lived in the land; their settlements spread from Bashan to Baal-hermon and Senir and Mount Hermon. 















###### 24 







These were the heads of their fathers' households: Epher, Ishi, Eliel, Azriel, Jeremiah, Hodaviah, and Jahdiel, warriors of valor [willing and able to encounter danger], famous men, and heads of the households of their fathers. 















###### 25 







But they acted treacherously against the God of their fathers and played the prostitute with the gods of the peoples of the land, whom God had destroyed before them. 















###### 26 







So the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul, king of Assyria, [that is,] the spirit of Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria, and he carried them away into exile--the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh--and brought them to Halah, Habor, Hara, and the river Gozan, [where they remain] to this day. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

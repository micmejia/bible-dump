# 1 Corinthians 1

***
















###### 1 







Paul, called as an apostle (special messenger, personally chosen representative) of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and our brother [^a]Sosthenes, 















###### 2 







To the church of God in Corinth, to those sanctified (set apart, made holy) in Christ Jesus, who are selected _and_ called as saints (God's people), together with all those who in every place call on _and_ honor the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their _Lord_ and ours: 















###### 3 







Grace to you and peace [inner calm and spiritual well-being] from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 















###### 4 







I thank my God always for you because of the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus, 















###### 5 







so that in everything you were [exceedingly] enriched in Him, in all speech [empowered by the spiritual gifts] and in all knowledge [with insight into the faith]. 















###### 6 







In this way our testimony about Christ was confirmed _and_ established in you, 















###### 7 







so that you are not lacking in any _spiritual_ gift [which comes from the Holy Spirit], as you eagerly wait [with confident trust] for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ [when He returns]. 















###### 8 







And He will also confirm you to the end [keeping you strong and free of any accusation, so that you will be] blameless _and_ beyond reproach in the day [of the return] of our Lord Jesus Christ. 















###### 9 







God is faithful [He is reliable, trustworthy and ever true to His promise--He can be depended on], and through Him you were called into fellowship with His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. 















###### 10 







But I urge you, believers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you be in full agreement in what you say, and that there be no divisions _or_ factions among you, but that you be perfectly united in your way of thinking and in your judgment [about matters of the faith]. 















###### 11 







For I have been informed about you, my brothers and sisters, by those of Chloe's _household_, that there are quarrels _and_ factions among you. 















###### 12 







Now I mean this, that each one of you says, "I am [a disciple] of Paul," or "I am [a disciple] of Apollos," or "I am [a disciple] of Cephas (Peter)," or "I am [a disciple] of Christ." 















###### 13 







Has Christ been divided [into different parts]? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized into the name of Paul? [Certainly not!] 















###### 14 







I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius, 















###### 15 







so that no one would say that you were baptized into my name. 















###### 16 







Now I also baptized the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I do not know if I baptized anyone else. 















###### 17 







For Christ did not send me [as an apostle] to baptize, but [commissioned and empowered me] to preach the good news [of salvation]--not with clever _and_ eloquent speech [as an orator], so that the cross of Christ would not be [^b]made ineffective [deprived of its saving power]. ## The Wisdom of God 















###### 18 







For the message of the cross is foolishness [absurd and illogical] to those who are perishing _and_ spiritually dead [because they reject it], but to us who are being saved [by God's grace] it is [the manifestation of] the power of God. 















###### 19 







For it is written _and_ forever remains written, "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise [the philosophy of the philosophers], And the cleverness of the clever [who do not know Me] I will nullify." 















###### 20 







Where is the wise man (philosopher)? Where is the scribe (scholar)? Where is the debater (logician, orator) of this age? Has God not exposed the foolishness of this world's wisdom? 















###### 21 







For since the world through all its [earthly] wisdom failed to recognize God, God in His wisdom was well-pleased through the [^c]foolishness of the message preached [regarding salvation] to save those who believe [in Christ and welcome Him as Savior]. 















###### 22 







For Jews demand signs (attesting miracles), and Greeks pursue [worldly] wisdom _and_ philosophy, 















###### 23 







but we preach Christ crucified, [a message which is] to Jews a stumbling block [that provokes their opposition], and to Gentiles foolishness [just utter nonsense], 















###### 24 







but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks (Gentiles), Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God. 















###### 25 







[This is] because the foolishness of God [is not foolishness at all and] is wiser than men [far beyond human comprehension], and the weakness of God is stronger than men [far beyond the limits of human effort]. 















###### 26 







Just look at your own calling, believers; not many [of you were considered] wise according to human standards, not many powerful _or_ influential, not many of high _and_ noble birth. 















###### 27 







But God has selected [for His purpose] the foolish things of the world to shame the wise [revealing their ignorance], and God has selected [for His purpose] the weak things of the world to shame the things which are strong [revealing their frailty]. 















###### 28 







God has selected [for His purpose] the insignificant (base) things of the world, and the things that are despised _and_ treated with contempt, [even] the things that are nothing, so that He might reduce to nothing the things that are, 















###### 29 







so that no one may [be able to] boast in the presence of God. 















###### 30 







But it is from Him that you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God [revealing His plan of salvation], and righteousness [making us acceptable to God], and sanctification [making us holy and setting us apart for God], and redemption [providing our ransom from the penalty for sin], 















###### 31 







so then, as it is written [in Scripture], "He who boasts _and_ glories, let him boast _and_ glory in the Lord." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: 1 Corinthians 1:17 Paul may be referring to the danger that convincing people to become Christians by the use of clever rhetoric would result in false conversions (cf 2:5). [^c]: 1 Corinthians 1:21 The straightforward message of salvation seemed foolish to unbelievers.

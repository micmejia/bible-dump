# 1 Corinthians 3

***
















###### 1 







However, brothers and sisters, I could not talk to you as to spiritual people, but [only] as to [^a]worldly people [dominated by human nature], _mere_ infants [in the new life] in Christ! 















###### 2 







I fed you with milk, not solid food; for you were not yet able _to receive it_. Even now you are still not ready. 















###### 3 







You are still [^b]worldly [controlled by ordinary impulses, the sinful capacity]. For as long as there is jealousy and strife _and_ discord among you, are you not [^c]unspiritual, and are you not walking like ordinary men [unchanged by faith]? 















###### 4 







For when one _of you_ says, "I am [a disciple] of Paul," and another, "I am [a disciple] of Apollos," are you not [proving yourselves unchanged, just] _ordinary_ people? 















###### 5 







What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? Just servants through whom you believed [in Christ], even as the Lord appointed to each his task. 















###### 6 







I planted, Apollos watered, but God [all the while] was causing the growth. 















###### 7 







So neither is the one who plants nor the one who waters anything, but [only] God who causes the growth. 















###### 8 







He who plants and he who waters are one [in importance and esteem, working toward the same purpose]; but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor. 















###### 9 







For we are God's fellow workers [His servants working together]; you are God's cultivated field [His garden, His vineyard], God's building. 















###### 10 







According to the [remarkable] grace of God which was given to me [to prepare me for my task], like a skillful master builder I laid a foundation, and now another is building on it. But each one must be careful how he builds on it, 















###### 11 







for no one can lay a foundation other than the one which is [already] laid, which is Jesus Christ. 















###### 12 







But if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, 















###### 13 







each one's work will be clearly shown [for what it is]; for the day [of judgment] will disclose it, because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality _and_ character _and_ worth of each person's work. 















###### 14 







If any person's work which he has built [on this foundation, that is, any outcome of his effort] remains [and survives this test], he will receive a reward. 















###### 15 







But if any person's work is burned up [by the test], he will suffer the loss [of his reward]; yet he himself will be saved, but only as [one who has barely escaped] through fire. 















###### 16 







[^d]Do you not know _and_ understand that you [the church] are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells [permanently] in you [collectively and individually]? 















###### 17 







If anyone destroys the temple of God [corrupting it with false doctrine], God will destroy the destroyer; for the temple of God is holy (sacred), and that is what you are. 















###### 18 







Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you thinks that he is wise in this age, let him become a fool [discarding his worldly pretensions and acknowledging his lack of wisdom], so that he may become [truly] wise. 















###### 19 







For the wisdom of this world is foolishness (absurdity, stupidity) before God; for it is written [in Scripture], "[He is] The one who catches the wise _and_ clever in their craftiness;" 















###### 20 







and again, "The Lord knows the thoughts of the [humanly] wise, that they are useless." 















###### 21 







So let no one boast in men [about their wisdom, or of having this or that one as a leader]. For all things are yours, 















###### 22 







whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas (Peter) or the world or life or death or things present or things to come; all things are yours, 















###### 23

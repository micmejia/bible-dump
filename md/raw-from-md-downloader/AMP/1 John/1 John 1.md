# 1 John 1

***
















###### 1 







[I am writing about] what existed from the beginning, what [^a]we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we have looked at and touched with our hands, concerning the Word of Life [the One who existed even before the beginning of the world, Christ]-- 















###### 2 







and the Life [an aspect of His being] was manifested, and we have seen [it as eyewitnesses] and testify and declare to you [the Life], the eternal Life who was [already existing] with the Father and was [actually] made visible to us [His followers]-- 















###### 3 







what we have seen and heard we also proclaim to you, so that you too may have fellowship [as partners] with us. And indeed our fellowship [which is a distinguishing mark of born-again believers] is with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ. 















###### 4 







We are writing these things to you so that our joy [in seeing you included] may be made complete [by having you share in the joy of salvation]. ## God Is Light 















###### 5 







This is the message [of God's promised revelation] which we have heard from Him and now announce to you, that God is Light [He is holy, His message is truthful, He is perfect in righteousness], and in Him there is no darkness at all [no sin, no wickedness, no imperfection]. 















###### 6 







If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness [of sin], we lie and do not practice the truth; 















###### 7 







but if we [really] walk in the Light [that is, live each and every day in conformity with the precepts of God], as He Himself is in the Light, we have [true, unbroken] fellowship with one another [He with us, and we with Him], and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin [by erasing the stain of sin, keeping us cleansed from sin in all its forms and manifestations]. 















###### 8 







If we say we have no sin [refusing to admit that we are sinners], we delude ourselves and the truth is not in us. [His word does not live in our hearts.] 















###### 9 







If we [freely] admit that we have sinned _and_ confess our sins, He is faithful and just [true to His own nature and promises], and will forgive our sins and cleanse us _continually_ from all unrighteousness [our wrongdoing, everything not in conformity with His will and purpose]. 















###### 10 







If we say that we have not sinned [refusing to admit acts of sin], we make Him [out to be] a liar [by contradicting Him] and His word is not in us. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# 1 John 2

***
















###### 1 







My little children (believers, dear ones), I am writing you these things so that you will not sin _and_ violate God's law. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate [who will intercede for us] with the Father: Jesus Christ the righteous [the upright, the just One, who conforms to the Father's will in every way--purpose, thought, and action]. 















###### 2 







And He [that same Jesus] is the propitiation for our sins [the atoning sacrifice that holds back the wrath of God that would otherwise be directed at us because of our sinful nature--our worldliness, our lifestyle]; and not for ours alone, but also for [the sins of all believers throughout] the whole world. 















###### 3 







And this is how we know [daily, by experience] that we have come to know Him [to understand Him and be more deeply acquainted with Him]: if we _habitually_ keep [focused on His precepts and obey] His commandments (teachings). 















###### 4 







Whoever says, "I have come to know Him," but does not _habitually_ keep [focused on His precepts and obey] His commandments (teachings), is a liar, and the truth [of the divine word] is not in him. 















###### 5 







But whoever _habitually_ keeps His word _and_ obeys His precepts [and treasures His message in its entirety], in him the love of God has truly been perfected [it is completed and has reached maturity]. By this we know [for certain] that we are in Him: 















###### 6 







whoever says he lives in Christ [that is, whoever says he has accepted Him as God and Savior] ought [as a moral obligation] to walk _and_ conduct himself just as He walked _and_ conducted Himself. 















###### 7 







Beloved, I am not writing a new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning; the old commandment is the message which you have heard [before from us]. 















###### 8 







On the other hand, I am writing a new commandment to you, which is true _and_ realized in Christ and in you, because the darkness [of moral blindness] is clearing away and the true Light [the revelation of God in Christ] is already shining. 















###### 9 







The one who says he is in the Light [in consistent fellowship with Christ] and yet [^a]_habitually_ hates (works against) his brother [in Christ] is in the darkness until now. 















###### 10 







The one who [^b]loves _and_ unselfishly seeks the best for his [believing] brother lives in the Light, and in him there is no occasion for stumbling _or_ offense [he does not hurt the cause of Christ or lead others to sin]. 















###### 11 







But the one who _habitually_ hates (works against) his brother [in Christ] is in [spiritual] darkness and is walking in the darkness, and does not know where he is going because the darkness has blinded his eyes. 















###### 12 







I am writing to you, little children (believers, dear ones), because your sins have been forgiven for His name's sake [you have been pardoned and released from spiritual debt through His name because you have confessed His name, believing in Him as Savior]. 















###### 13 







I am writing to you, fathers [those believers who are spiritually mature], because you know Him who has existed from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men [those believers who are growing in spiritual maturity], because you have been victorious _and_ have overcome the evil one. I have written to you, children [those who are new believers, those spiritually immature], because you have come to know the Father. 















###### 14 







I have written to you, fathers, because you know Him who has existed from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong _and_ vigorous, and the word of God remains [always] in you, and you have been victorious over the evil one [by accepting Jesus as Savior]. ## Do Not Love the World 















###### 15 







Do not love the world [of sin that opposes God and His precepts], nor the things that are in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 















###### 16 







For all that is in the world--the lust _and_ sensual craving of the flesh and the lust _and_ longing of the eyes and the boastful pride of life [pretentious confidence in one's resources or in the stability of earthly things]--these do not come from the Father, but are from the world. 















###### 17 







The world is passing away, and with it its lusts [the shameful pursuits and ungodly longings]; but the one who does the will of God _and_ carries out His purposes lives forever. 















###### 18 







Children, it is the last hour [the end of this age]; and just as you heard that the antichrist is coming [the one who will oppose Christ and attempt to replace Him], even now many antichrists (false teachers) have appeared, which confirms our belief that it is the last hour. 















###### 19 







They went out from us [seeming at first to be Christians], but they were not _really_ of us [because they were not truly born again and spiritually transformed]; for if they had been of us, they would have remained with us; but _they went out_ [teaching false doctrine], so that it would be clearly shown that none of them are of us. 















###### 20 







But you have an anointing from the Holy One [you have been set apart, specially gifted and prepared by the Holy Spirit], and all of you know [the truth because He teaches us, illuminates our minds, and guards us from error]. 















###### 21 







I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it, and because no lie [nothing false, no deception] is of the truth. 















###### 22 







Who is the liar but the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed)? This is the antichrist [the enemy and antagonist of Christ], the one who denies _and_ consistently refuses to acknowledge the Father and the Son. 















###### 23 







Whoever denies _and_ repudiates the Son does not have the Father; the one who confesses _and_ acknowledges the Son has the Father also. 















###### 24 







As for you, let that remain in you [keeping in your hearts that message of salvation] which you heard from the beginning. If what you heard from the beginning remains in you, you too will remain in the Son and in the Father [forever]. ## The Promise Is Eternal Life 















###### 25 







This is the promise which He Himself promised us--eternal life. 















###### 26 







These things I have written to you with reference to those who are trying to deceive you [seducing you and leading you away from the truth and sound doctrine]. 















###### 27 







As for you, the anointing [the special gift, the preparation] which you received from Him remains [permanently] in you, and you have no need for anyone to teach you. But just as His anointing teaches you [giving you insight through the presence of the Holy Spirit] about all things, and is true and is not a lie, and just as His anointing has taught you, [^c]you must remain in Him [being rooted in Him, knit to Him]. 















###### 28 







Now, little children (believers, dear ones), remain in Him [with unwavering faith], so that when He appears [at His return], we may have [perfect] confidence and not be ashamed and shrink away from Him at His coming. 















###### 29 







If you know that He is _absolutely_ righteous, you know [for certain] that everyone who practices righteousness [doing what is right and conforming to God's will] has been born of Him. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: 1 John 2:10 The key to understanding this and other statements about love is to know that this love (the Greek word _agape_) is not so much a matter of emotion as it is of doing things for the benefit of another person, that is, having an unselfish concern for another and a willingness to seek the best for another. [^c]: 1 John 2:27 Or _you are abiding_.

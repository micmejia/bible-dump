# 1 John 3

***
















###### 1 







See what an incredible quality of love the Father has shown to us, that we would [be permitted to] be named _and_ called _and_ counted the children of God! And so we are! For this reason the world does not know us, because it did not know Him. 















###### 2 







Beloved, we are [even here and] now children of God, and it is not yet made clear what we will be [after His coming]. We know that when He comes _and_ is revealed, we will [as His children] be like Him, because we will see Him just as He is [in all His glory]. 















###### 3 







And everyone who has this hope [confidently placed] in Him purifies himself, just as He is pure (holy, undefiled, guiltless). 















###### 4 







Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness [ignoring God's law by action or neglect or by tolerating wrongdoing--being unrestrained by His commands and His will]. 















###### 5 







You know that He appeared [in visible form as a man] in order to take away sins; and in Him there is [absolutely] no sin [for He has neither the sin nature nor has He committed sin or acts worthy of blame]. 















###### 6 







No one who abides in Him [who remains united in fellowship with Him--deliberately, knowingly, and habitually] practices sin. No one who _habitually_ sins has seen Him or known Him. 















###### 7 







Little children (believers, dear ones), do not let anyone lead you astray. The one who practices righteousness [the one who strives to live a consistently honorable life--in private as well as in public--and to conform to God's precepts] is righteous, just as He is righteous. 















###### 8 







The one who practices sin [separating himself from God, and offending Him by acts of disobedience, indifference, or rebellion] is of the devil [and takes his inner character and moral values from him, not God]; for the devil has sinned _and_ violated God's law from the beginning. The Son of God appeared for this purpose, to destroy the works of the devil. 















###### 9 







No one who is born of God [deliberately, knowingly, and habitually] practices sin, because [^a]God's seed [His principle of life, the essence of His righteous character] remains [permanently] in him [who is born again--who is reborn from above--spiritually transformed, renewed, and set apart for His purpose]; and he [who is born again] cannot _habitually_ [live a life characterized by] sin, because he is born of God _and_ longs to please Him. 















###### 10 







By this the children of God and the children of the devil are clearly identified: anyone who does not practice righteousness [who does not seek God's will in thought, action, and purpose] is not of God, nor is the one who does not [unselfishly] [^b]love his [believing] brother. 















###### 11 







For this is the message which you [believers] have heard from the beginning [of your relationship with Christ], that we should [unselfishly] love _and_ seek the best for one another; 















###### 12 







and not be like Cain, who was of the evil one and murdered his brother [Abel]. And why did he murder him? Because Cain's deeds were evil, and his brother's were righteous. 















###### 13 







Do not be surprised, believers, if the world hates you. 















###### 14 







We know that we have passed out of death into Life, because we love the brothers and sisters. He who does not love remains in [spiritual] death. 















###### 15 







Everyone who hates (works against) his brother [in Christ] is [at heart] a murderer [by God's standards]; and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him. 















###### 16 







By this we know [and have come to understand the depth and essence of His precious] love: that He [willingly] laid down His life for us [because He loved us]. And we ought to lay down our lives for the believers. 















###### 17 







But whoever has the [^c]world's goods (adequate resources), and sees his brother in need, but has no compassion for him, how does the love of God live in him? 















###### 18 







Little children (believers, dear ones), let us not love [merely in theory] with word or with tongue [giving lip service to compassion], but in action and in truth [in practice and in sincerity, because practical acts of love are more than words]. 















###### 19 







By this we will know [without any doubt] that we are of the truth, and will assure our heart _and_ quiet our conscience before Him 















###### 20 







whenever our heart convicts us [in guilt]; for God is greater than our heart and He knows all things [nothing is hidden from Him because we are in His hands]. 















###### 21 







Beloved, if our heart does not convict us [of guilt], we have confidence [complete assurance and boldness] before God; 















###### 22 







and we receive from Him whatever we ask because we [carefully and consistently] keep His commandments and do the things that are pleasing in His sight [habitually seeking to follow His plan for us]. 















###### 23 







This is His commandment, that we believe [with personal faith and confident trust] in the name of His Son Jesus Christ, and [that we unselfishly] love _and_ seek the best for one another, just as He commanded us. 















###### 24 







The one who _habitually_ keeps His commandments [obeying His word and following His precepts, abides and] remains in Him, and He in him. By this we know _and_ have the proof that He [really] abides in us, by the Spirit whom He has given us [as a gift]. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

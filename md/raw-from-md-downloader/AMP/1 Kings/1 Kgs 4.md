[^b]: 1 Kings 4:7 Lit _provided_. [^c]: 1 Kings 4:21 In the Hebrew text ch 5 begins with this verse. [^d]: 1 Kings 4:22 This was the largest unit of volume, but the actual amount varied because it was based on the volume of an egg, the basic Jewish standard of volume. The _kor_ was equivalent to the _homer_ and was supposed to equal 4,320 eggs. Modern estimates of the volume range between seven and twelve bushels. [^e]: 1 Kings 4:26 One ms reads 4,000; cf 2 Chr 9:25. [^f]: 1 Kings 4:31 “Wiser than all [other] men,” until Christ came. Jesus said, “Someone more _and_ greater than Solomon is here” (Matt 12:42). [^g]: 1 Kings 4:31 Together with Zimri (1 Chr 2:6), these men were reputed to be the wisest in the world.

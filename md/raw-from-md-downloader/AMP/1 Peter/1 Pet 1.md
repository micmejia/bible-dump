# 1 Peter 1

***
















###### 1 







Peter, an apostle (special messenger, personally chosen representative) of Jesus Christ, To those [elect--both Jewish and Gentile believers] who live as exiles, scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia [Minor], and Bithynia, who are chosen 















###### 2 







according to the foreknowledge of God the Father by the sanctifying work of the Spirit to be obedient to Jesus Christ and to be sprinkled with His blood: May grace and peace [that special sense of spiritual well-being] be yours in increasing abundance [as you walk closely with God]. 















###### 3 







Blessed [gratefully praised and adored] be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His abundant _and_ boundless mercy has caused us to be born again [that is, to be reborn from above--spiritually transformed, renewed, and set apart for His purpose] to an ever-living hope _and_ confident assurance through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, 















###### 4 







[born anew] into an inheritance which is imperishable [beyond the reach of change] and undefiled and unfading, reserved in heaven for you, 















###### 5 







who are being protected _and_ shielded by the power of God through _your_ faith for salvation that is ready to be revealed [for you] in the last time. 















###### 6 







In this you rejoice greatly, even though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been distressed by various trials, 















###### 7 







so that the genuineness of your faith, which is much more precious than gold which is perishable, even though tested _and_ purified by fire, may be found to result in [your] praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ. 















###### 8 







Though you have not seen Him, you love Him; and though you do not even see Him now, you believe _and_ trust in Him and you greatly rejoice _and_ delight with inexpressible and glorious joy, 















###### 9 







receiving as the result [the outcome, the consummation] of your faith, the salvation of [^a]your souls. 















###### 10 







Regarding this salvation, the prophets who prophesied about the grace [of God] that _was intended for_ you, searched carefully and inquired [about this future way of salvation], 















###### 11 







seeking to find out what person or what time the Spirit of Christ within them was indicating as He foretold the sufferings of Christ and the glories [destined] to follow. 















###### 12 







It was revealed to them that their services [their prophecies regarding grace] were not [meant] for themselves _and_ their time, but for you, in these things [the death, resurrection, and glorification of Jesus Christ] which have now been told to you by those who preached the gospel to you by the [power of the] Holy Spirit [who was] sent from heaven. Into these things even the angels long to look. 















###### 13 







So prepare your minds for action, be completely sober [in spirit--steadfast, self-disciplined, spiritually and morally alert], fix your hope completely on the grace [of God] that is coming to you when Jesus Christ is revealed. 















###### 14 







[Live] as obedient children [of God]; do not be conformed to the evil desires _which governed you_ in your ignorance [before you knew the requirements and transforming power of the good news regarding salvation]. 















###### 15 







But like the Holy One who called you, be holy yourselves in all _your_ conduct [be set apart from the world by your godly character and moral courage]; 















###### 16 







because it is written, "You shall be holy (set apart), for I am holy." 















###### 17 







If you address as Father, the One who impartially judges according to each one's work, conduct yourselves in [reverent] fear [of Him] _and_ with profound respect for Him throughout the time of your stay _on earth_. 















###### 18 







For you know that you were not redeemed from your useless [spiritually unproductive] way of life inherited [by tradition] from your forefathers with perishable things like silver and gold, 















###### 19 







but [you were actually purchased] with precious blood, like that of a [sacrificial] lamb unblemished and spotless, _the priceless blood_ of Christ. 















###### 20 







For He was [^b]foreordained (foreknown) before the foundation of the world, but has appeared [publicly] in these last times for your sake 















###### 21 







and through Him you believe [confidently] in God [the heavenly Father], who raised Him from the dead and gave Him glory, so that your faith and hope are [centered and rest] in God. 















###### 22 







Since by your obedience to the truth you have purified yourselves for a sincere love of the believers, [see that you] love one another from the heart [always unselfishly seeking the best for one another], 















###### 23 







for you have been born again [that is, reborn from above--spiritually transformed, renewed, and set apart for His purpose] not of seed which is perishable but [from that which is] imperishable _and_ immortal, _that is_, through the living and everlasting word of God. 















###### 24 







For, "All flesh is like grass, And all its glory like the flower of grass. The grass withers And the flower falls off, 















###### 25 







But the word of the Lord endures forever." And this is the word [the good news of salvation] which was preached to you. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# 1 Peter 3

***
















###### 1 







In the same way, you wives, be [^a]submissive to your own husbands [subordinate, not as inferior, but out of respect for the responsibilities entrusted to husbands and their accountability to God, and so partnering with them] so that even if some do not obey the word [of God], they may be won over [to Christ] without discussion by the _godly_ lives of their wives, 















###### 2 







when they see your modest and respectful behavior [together with your devotion and appreciation--love your husband, encourage him, and enjoy him as a blessing from God]. 















###### 3 







Your adornment must not be _merely_ external--with interweaving _and_ elaborate knotting of the hair, and wearing gold jewelry, or [being superficially preoccupied with] dressing in _expensive_ clothes; 















###### 4 







but let it be [the inner beauty of] the hidden person of the heart, with the imperishable quality _and_ unfading charm of a gentle and peaceful spirit, [one that is calm and self-controlled, not overanxious, but serene and spiritually mature] which is very precious in the sight of God. 















###### 5 







For in this way in former times the holy women, who hoped in God, used to adorn themselves, being submissive to their own husbands _and_ adapting themselves to them; 















###### 6 







just as Sarah obeyed Abraham [following him and having regard for him as head of their house], calling him [^b]lord. And you have become her daughters if you do what is right without being frightened by any fear [that is, being respectful toward your husband but not giving in to intimidation, nor allowing yourself to be led into sin, nor to be harmed]. 















###### 7 







In the same way, you husbands, live with _your wives_ in an understanding way [with great gentleness and tact, and with an intelligent regard for the marriage relationship], as with [^c]someone physically weaker, since she is a woman. Show her honor _and_ respect as a fellow heir of the grace of life, so that your prayers will not be hindered _or_ ineffective. 















###### 8 







Finally, all of you be like-minded [united in spirit], sympathetic, brotherly, kindhearted [courteous and compassionate toward each other as members of one household], and humble in spirit; 















###### 9 







and never return evil for evil or insult for insult [avoid scolding, berating, and any kind of abuse], but on the contrary, give a blessing [pray for one another's well-being, contentment, and protection]; for you have been called for this very purpose, that you might inherit a blessing [from God that brings well-being, happiness, and protection]. 















###### 10 







For, "The one who wants to enjoy life and see good days [good--whether apparent or not], Must keep his tongue free from evil and his lips from speaking guile (treachery, deceit). 















###### 11 







"He must turn away from wickedness and do what is right. He must search for peace [with God, with self, with others] and pursue it eagerly [actively--not merely desiring it]. 















###### 12 







"For the eyes of the Lord are [looking favorably] upon the righteous (the upright), And His ears are attentive to their prayer (eager to answer), But the face of the Lord is against those who practice evil." 















###### 13 







Now who is there to hurt you if you become enthusiastic for what is good? 















###### 14 







But even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness [though it is not certain that you will], you are still blessed [happy, to be admired and favored by God]. Do not be afraid of their intimidating threats, nor be troubled _or_ disturbed [by their opposition]. 















###### 15 







But in your hearts set Christ apart [as holy--acknowledging Him, giving Him first place in your lives] as Lord. Always be ready to give a [logical] defense to anyone who asks you to account for the hope _and_ confident assurance [elicited by faith] that is within you, yet [do it] with gentleness and respect. 















###### 16 







And see to it that your conscience is entirely clear, so that every time you are slandered _or_ falsely accused, those who attack _or_ disparage your good behavior in Christ will be shamed [by their own words]. 















###### 17 







For it is better that you suffer [unjustly] for doing what is right, if that should be God's will, than [to suffer justly] for doing wrong. 















###### 18 







For indeed Christ died for sins once for all, the Just _and_ Righteous for the unjust _and_ unrighteous [the Innocent for the guilty] so that He might bring us to God, having been put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the Spirit; 















###### 19 







in which He also went and preached to the spirits _now_ in prison, 















###### 20 







who once were disobedient, when the _great_ patience of God was waiting in the days of Noah, during the building of the ark, in which a few, that is, eight persons [Noah's family], were brought safely through the water. 















###### 21 







Corresponding to that [rescue through the flood], baptism [which is an expression of a believer's new life in Christ] now [^d]saves you, not by removing dirt from the body, but by an appeal to God for a good (clear) conscience, [demonstrating what you believe to be yours] through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, 















###### 22 







who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God [that is, the place of honor and authority], with [all] angels and authorities and powers made subservient to Him. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# 1 Peter 4

***
















###### 1 







Therefore, since [^a]Christ suffered in the flesh [and died for us], arm yourselves [like warriors] with the same purpose [being willing to suffer for doing what is right and pleasing God], because whoever has suffered in the flesh [being like-minded with Christ] is done with [intentional] sin [having stopped pleasing the world], 















###### 2 







so that he can no longer spend the rest of his natural life living for human appetites _and_ desires, but [lives] for the will _and_ purpose of God. 















###### 3 







For the time already past is [more than] enough for doing what the [unsaved] Gentiles like to do--[^b]living [unrestrained as you have done] in a course of [shameless] sensuality, lusts, drunkenness, carousing, drinking parties, and wanton idolatries. 















###### 4 







In [connection with] all this, they [the unbelievers] are resentful _and_ surprised that you do not [think like them, value their values and] run [hand in hand] with _them_ into the same excesses of dissipation _and_ immoral freedom, and they criticize _and_ abuse _and_ ridicule you _and_ make fun of your values. 















###### 5 







But they will [have to] give an account to Him who is ready to judge _and_ pass sentence on the living and the dead. 















###### 6 







For this is why the good news [of salvation] was preached [in their lifetimes] even to those who are dead, that though they were judged in the flesh as men are, they may live in the spirit according to [the will and purpose of] God. 















###### 7 







The end _and_ culmination of all things is near. Therefore, be sound-minded and self-controlled for the purpose of prayer [staying balanced and focused on the things of God so that your communication will be clear, reasonable, specific and pleasing to Him.] 















###### 8 







Above all, have [^c]fervent _and_ unfailing love for one another, because love covers a multitude of sins [it overlooks unkindness and unselfishly seeks the best for others]. 















###### 9 







Be [^d]hospitable to one another without complaint. 















###### 10 







Just as each one of you has received a _special_ gift [a spiritual talent, an ability graciously given by God], employ it in serving one another as [is appropriate for] good stewards of God's multi-faceted grace [faithfully using the diverse, varied gifts and abilities granted to Christians by God's unmerited favor]. 















###### 11 







Whoever speaks [to the congregation], _is to do so_ as one who speaks the oracles (utterances, the very words) of God. Whoever serves [the congregation] _is to do so_ as one who serves by the strength which God [abundantly] supplies, so that in all things God may be glorified [honored and magnified] through Jesus Christ, to whom belongs the glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. ## Share the Sufferings of Christ 















###### 12 







Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal which is taking place to test you [that is, to test the quality of your faith], as though something strange _or_ unusual were happening to you. 















###### 13 







But insofar as you are sharing Christ's sufferings, keep on rejoicing, so that when His glory [filled with His radiance and splendor] is revealed, you may rejoice with great joy. 















###### 14 







If you are insulted _and_ reviled for [bearing] the name of Christ, you are blessed [happy, with life-joy and comfort in God's salvation regardless of your circumstances], because the Spirit of glory and of God is resting on you [and indwelling you--He whom they curse, you glorify]. 















###### 15 







Make sure that none of you suffers as a murderer, or a thief, or any sort of criminal [in response to persecution], or as a troublesome meddler interfering in the affairs of others; 















###### 16 







but if _anyone suffers_ [ill-treatment] as a [^e]Christian [because of his belief], he is not to be ashamed, but is to glorify God [because he is considered worthy to suffer] in this name. 















###### 17 







For it is the time [destined] for judgment to begin with the household of God; and if _it begins_ with us, what will the outcome be for those who do not respect _or_ believe _or_ obey the gospel of God? 















###### 18 







And if it is difficult for the righteous to be saved, what will become of the godless and the sinner? 















###### 19 







Therefore, those who are ill-treated _and_ suffer in accordance with the will of God must [continue to] do right and commit their souls [for safe-keeping] to the faithful Creator. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

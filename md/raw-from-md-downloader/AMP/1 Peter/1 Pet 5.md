# 1 Peter 5

***
















###### 1 







Therefore, I strongly urge the elders among you [pastors, spiritual leaders of the church], as a fellow elder and as an eyewitness [called to testify] of the sufferings of Christ, as well as one who shares in the glory that is to be revealed: 















###### 2 







shepherd _and_ guide _and_ protect the flock of God among you, exercising oversight not under compulsion, but voluntarily, according to _the will of_ God; and not [motivated] for shameful gain, but with wholehearted enthusiasm; 















###### 3 







not lording it over those assigned to your care [do not be arrogant or overbearing], but be examples [of Christian living] to the flock [set a pattern of integrity for your congregation]. 















###### 4 







And when the Chief Shepherd (Christ) appears, you will receive the [conqueror's] unfading crown of glory. 















###### 5 







Likewise, you younger men [of lesser rank and experience], be subject to your elders [seek their counsel]; and all of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another [tie on the servant's apron], for God is opposed to the proud [the disdainful, the presumptuous, and He defeats them], but He gives grace to the humble. 















###### 6 







Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God [set aside self-righteous pride], so that He may exalt you [to a place of honor in His service] at the appropriate time, 















###### 7 







casting all your cares [all your anxieties, all your worries, and all your concerns, once and for all] on Him, for He cares about you [with deepest affection, and watches over you very carefully]. 















###### 8 







Be sober [well balanced and self-disciplined], be alert _and_ cautious at all times. That enemy of yours, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion [fiercely hungry], seeking someone to devour. 















###### 9 







But resist him, be firm in _your_ faith [against his attack--rooted, established, immovable], knowing that the same experiences of suffering are being experienced by your brothers and sisters throughout the world. [You do not suffer alone.] 















###### 10 







After you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace [who imparts His blessing and favor], who called you to His _own_ eternal glory in Christ, will Himself complete, confirm, strengthen, and establish you [making you what you ought to be]. 















###### 11 







To Him be dominion (power, authority, sovereignty) forever and ever. Amen. 















###### 12 







By [^a]Silvanus, our faithful brother **(**as I consider him**)**, I have written to you briefly, to counsel and testify that this is the true grace [the undeserved favor] of God. Stand firm in it! 















###### 13 







She [the church] who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you greetings, and _so does_ my son [in the faith], Mark. 















###### 14 







Greet one another with a kiss of love. To all of you who are in Christ, may there be peace. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

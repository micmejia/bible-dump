# 1 Samuel 1

***
















###### 1 







There was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of the [^a]hill country of Ephraim, named Elkanah the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an [^b]Ephraimite. 















###### 2 







He had two wives, one named Hannah and the other named Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none. 















###### 3 







This man went up from his city [^c]each year to worship and sacrifice to the LORD of hosts at Shiloh. Hophni and Phinehas, the two sons of Eli, were priests to the LORD there. 















###### 4 







When the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he would give portions [of the sacrificial meat] to Peninnah his wife and all her sons and daughters. 















###### 5 







But to Hannah he would give a double portion, because he loved Hannah, but the LORD had [^d]given her no children. 















###### 6 







Hannah's rival provoked her bitterly, to irritate _and_ embarrass her, because the LORD had [^e]left her childless. 















###### 7 







So it happened year after year, whenever she went up to the house of the LORD, Peninnah provoked her; so she wept and would not eat. 















###### 8 







Then Elkanah her husband said to her, "Hannah, why do you cry and why do you not eat? Why are you so sad _and_ discontent? Am I not better to you than ten sons?" 















###### 9 







So Hannah got up after eating and drinking in Shiloh. Now Eli the priest was sitting on his seat beside the doorpost of the temple (tabernacle) of the LORD. 















###### 10 







Hannah was [^f]greatly distressed, and she prayed to the LORD and wept in anguish. 















###### 11 







She made a vow, saying, "O LORD of hosts, if You will indeed look on the affliction (suffering) of Your maidservant and remember, and not forget Your maidservant, but will give Your maidservant a son, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life; a [^g]razor shall never touch his head." 















###### 12 







Now it happened as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli was watching her mouth. 















###### 13 







Hannah was speaking in her heart (mind); only her lips were moving, and her voice was not heard, so Eli [^h]thought she was drunk. 















###### 14 







Eli said to her, "How long will you make yourself drunk? Get rid of your wine." 















###### 15 







But Hannah answered, "No, my lord, I am a woman with a despairing spirit. I have not been drinking wine or _any_ intoxicating drink, but I have poured out my soul before the LORD. 















###### 16 







Do not regard your maidservant as a wicked _and_ worthless woman, for I have spoken until now out of my great concern and [bitter] provocation." 















###### 17 







Then Eli answered and said, "Go in peace; and may the God of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of Him." 















###### 18 







Hannah said, "Let your maidservant find grace _and_ favor in your sight." So the woman went on her way and ate, and her face was no longer _sad_. ## Samuel Is Born to Hannah 















###### 19 







The family got up early the next morning, worshiped before the LORD, and returned to their home in Ramah. Elkanah knew Hannah his wife, and the LORD remembered her [prayer]. 















###### 20 







It came about in due time, after Hannah had conceived, that she gave birth to a son; she named him [^i]Samuel, _saying_, "Because I have asked for him from the LORD." 















###### 21 







Then the man Elkanah and all his household went up to offer to the LORD the [^j]yearly sacrifice and _pay_ his vow. 















###### 22 







But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, "_I will not go up_ until the child is [^k]weaned; and then I will bring him, so that he may appear before the LORD and remain there as long as he lives." 















###### 23 







Elkanah her husband said to her, "Do what seems best to you. Wait until you have weaned him; only may the LORD establish _and_ confirm His word." So the woman remained [behind] and nursed her son until she weaned him. 















###### 24 







Now when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, along with a three-year-old bull, an ephah of flour, and a [^l]leather bottle of wine [to pour over the burnt offering for a sweet fragrance], and she brought Samuel to the Lord's house in Shiloh, although the child was young. 















###### 25 







Then they slaughtered the bull, and brought the child to Eli. 















###### 26 







Hannah said, "Oh, my lord! As [surely as] your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman who stood beside you here, praying to the LORD. 















###### 27 







For this child I prayed, and the LORD has granted me my request which I asked of Him. 















###### 28 







Therefore I have also dedicated him to the LORD; as long as he lives he is dedicated to the LORD." And they worshiped the LORD there. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: 1 Samuel 1:1 It is sometimes claimed that Samuel was from the tribe of Ephraim (rather than the tribe of Levi) and so was not eligible to serve as a priest. He was an Ephraimite only in the sense that his family lived in the tribal area of Ephraim. His genealogy is given in 1 Chr 6:22-28. At least two other men in the passage are named Elkanah. Samuel’s father, Elkanah, is the man mentioned in 1 Chr 6:27. The men mentioned in 1 Chr 6:23, 24, and 26 are several generations removed from Samuel. [^c]: 1 Samuel 1:3 Lit _from days to days_. [^d]: 1 Samuel 1:5 Lit _closed her womb_. [^e]: 1 Samuel 1:6 Lit _closed her womb_. [^f]: 1 Samuel 1:10 Lit _bitter of soul_. [^g]: 1 Samuel 1:11 Lit _shearing knife_. This was a requirement of a Nazirite vow which would apply to Samuel all of his life (see Num 6:2 ff). [^h]: 1 Samuel 1:13 This implies that the custom at that time was to pray aloud; the outcome (vv 19, 20) shows that God hears prayer, whether it is spoken or silent. [^i]: 1 Samuel 1:20 The name possibly means “The Name [i.e. Yahweh, Lord] is God” or “His name is God,” but the etymology is uncertain. [^j]: 1 Samuel 1:21 Lit _sacrifice of days_. [^k]: 1 Samuel 1:22 At this time children were nursed until about age three. But it may be fair to say that Hannah also wanted to keep the boy as long as she reasonably could; giving up her only child—even for the best of purposes—must have been terribly difficult. [^l]: 1 Samuel 1:24 These containers were made from almost the entire skin of an animal and were used for holding wine.

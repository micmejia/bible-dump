# 1 Samuel 3

***
















###### 1 







Now the boy Samuel was attending to the service of the LORD [^a]under the supervision of Eli. The word of the LORD was rare _and_ precious in those days; visions [that is, new revelations of divine truth] were not widespread. 















###### 2 







Yet it happened at that time, as Eli was lying down in his own place **(**now his eyesight had begun to grow dim and he could not see _well_**)**. 















###### 3 







and the [oil] lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, 















###### 4 







that the LORD called Samuel, and he answered, "Here I am." 















###### 5 







He ran to Eli and said, "Here I am, for you called me." But Eli said, "I did not call you; lie down again." So he went and lay down. 















###### 6 







Then the LORD called yet again, "Samuel!" So Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, "Here I am, for you called me." But Eli answered, "I did not call, my son; lie down again." 















###### 7 







Now Samuel did not yet know [or personally experience] the LORD, and the word of the LORD was not yet revealed [directly] to him. 















###### 8 







So the LORD called Samuel a third time. And he stood and went to Eli and said, "Here I am, for you did call me." Then Eli understood that it was the LORD [who was] calling the boy. 















###### 9 







So Eli said to Samuel, "Go, lie down, and it shall be that if He calls you, you shall say, 'Speak, LORD, for Your servant is listening.'" So Samuel went and lay down in his place. 















###### 10 







Then the LORD came and stood and called as at the previous times, "Samuel! Samuel!" Then Samuel answered, "Speak, for Your servant is listening." 















###### 11 







The LORD said to Samuel, "Behold, I am about to do a thing in Israel at which both ears of everyone who hears it will ring. 















###### 12 







On that day I will carry out against Eli everything that I have spoken concerning his house (family), from beginning to end. 















###### 13 







Now I have told him that I am about to judge his house forever for the sinful behavior which he knew [was happening], because his sons were bringing a curse on themselves [dishonoring and blaspheming God] and he did not rebuke them. 















###### 14 







Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the sinful behavior of Eli's house (family) shall not be atoned for by sacrifice or offering forever." 















###### 15 







So Samuel lay down until morning. Then he opened the doors of the Lord's house. But Samuel was afraid to tell the vision to Eli. 















###### 16 







But Eli called Samuel and said, "Samuel, my son." And he answered, "Here I am." 















###### 17 







Then Eli said, "What is it that He said to you? Please do not hide it from me. May God do the same to you, and more also, if you hide from me anything of all that He said to you." 















###### 18 







So Samuel told him everything, hiding nothing from him. And Eli said, "It is the LORD; may He do what seems good [^b]to Him." 















###### 19 







Now Samuel grew; and the LORD was with him and He let none of his words [^c]fail [to be fulfilled]. 















###### 20 







And all Israel from Dan [in the north] to Beersheba [in the south] knew that Samuel was appointed as a prophet of the LORD. 















###### 21 







And the LORD continued to appear in Shiloh, for the LORD revealed Himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

***
















###### 1 







Paul, Silvanus (Silas), and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace [inner calm and spiritual well-being from God]. 















###### 2 







We give thanks to God always for all of you, _continually_ mentioning you in our prayers; 















###### 3 







recalling unceasingly before our God and Father your work energized by faith, and your service motivated by love and unwavering hope in [the return of] our Lord Jesus Christ. 















###### 4 







[^a]Brothers and sisters beloved by God, we know that He has chosen you; 















###### 5 







for our good news [regarding salvation] came to you not only in word, but also in [its inherent] power and in the Holy Spirit and with great conviction [on our part]. You know what kind of men we proved to be among you for your benefit. 















###### 6 







You became imitators of us and [through us] of the Lord, after you welcomed our message in [a time of] great trouble with the joy supplied by the Holy Spirit; 















###### 7 







so that you became an example to all the believers in [^b]Macedonia and in Achaia. 















###### 8 







For the word of the Lord has resounded from you _and_ has echoed [like thunder], not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place [the news of] your [great] faith in God has spread, so that we never need to say anything about it. 















###### 9 







For they themselves report about us, _telling_ what kind of reception we had among you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God, 















###### 10 







and to [look forward and confidently] wait for [the coming of] His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead--Jesus, who [personally] rescues us from the coming wrath [and draws us to Himself, granting us all the privileges and rewards of a new life with Him]. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

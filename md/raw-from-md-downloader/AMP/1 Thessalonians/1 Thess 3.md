# 1 Thessalonians 3

***
















###### 1 







Therefore, when we could no longer endure our separation [from you], we thought it best to be left behind, alone at Athens, 















###### 2 







and so we sent Timothy, our brother and God's servant in [spreading] the good news of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you [exhorting, comforting, and establishing you] in regard to your faith, 















###### 3 







so that no one would be unsettled by these difficulties [to which I have referred]. For you know that we have been destined for this [as something unavoidable in our position]. 















###### 4 







For even when we were with you, we warned you plainly in advance that we were going to experience persecution; and so, as you know, it has come to pass. 















###### 5 







For this reason, when I could no longer endure the suspense, I sent _someone_ to find out about your faith [how you were holding up under pressure], for fear that somehow the tempter had tempted you and our work [among you] would prove to be ineffective. 















###### 6 







But now that Timothy has come back to us from [his visit with] you, and has brought us good news of your [steadfast] faith and [the warmth of your] love, and [reported] that you always think kindly of us _and_ treasure your memories of us, longing to see us just as we long to see you, 















###### 7 







for this reason, brothers and sisters, during all our distress and suffering we have been comforted _and_ greatly encouraged about you because of your faith [your unwavering trust in God--placing yourselves completely in His loving hands]; 















###### 8 







because now we _really_ live [in spite of everything], if you stand firm in the Lord. 















###### 9 







For what [adequate] thanks can we offer to God for you in return for all the joy _and_ delight we have before our God on your account? 















###### 10 







We continue to pray night and day most earnestly that we may see you face to face, and may complete whatever may be imperfect _and_ lacking in your faith. 















###### 11 







Now may our God and Father Himself, and Jesus our Lord guide our steps to you [by removing the obstacles that stand in our way]. 















###### 12 







And may the Lord cause you to increase and excel _and_ overflow in love for one another, and for all people, just as we also do for you; 















###### 13 







so that He may strengthen _and_ establish your hearts without blame in holiness in the sight of our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all His [^a]saints (God's people). ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

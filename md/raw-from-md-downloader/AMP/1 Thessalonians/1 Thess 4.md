# 1 Thessalonians 4

***
















###### 1 







Finally, believers, we ask and admonish you in the Lord Jesus, that you follow the _instruction_ that you received from us about how you ought to walk and please God **(**just as you are actually doing**)** and that you excel even more and more [pursuing a life of purpose and living in a way that expresses gratitude to God for your salvation]. 















###### 2 







For you know what commandments _and_ precepts we gave you by the _authority of_ the Lord Jesus. 















###### 3 







For this is the will of God, that you be sanctified [separated and set apart from sin]: that you abstain _and_ back away from sexual immorality; 















###### 4 







that each of you know how to control his own body in holiness and honor [being available for God's purpose and separated from things profane], 















###### 5 







not [to be used] in lustful passion, like the Gentiles who do not know God _and_ are ignorant of His will; 















###### 6 







and that [in this matter of sexual misconduct] no man _shall_ transgress and defraud his brother because the Lord is the avenger in all these things, just as we have told you before and solemnly warned you. 















###### 7 







For God has not called us to impurity, but to holiness [to be dedicated, and set apart by behavior that pleases Him, whether in public or in private]. 















###### 8 







So whoever rejects _and_ disregards this is not [merely] rejecting man but the God who gives His Holy Spirit to you [to dwell in you and empower you to overcome temptation]. 















###### 9 







Now concerning brotherly love, you have no need for _anyone_ to write you, for you have been [personally] taught by God to love one another [that is, to have an unselfish concern for others and to do things for their benefit]. 















###### 10 







For indeed you already do practice it toward all the [^a]believers throughout Macedonia [by actively displaying your love and concern for them]. But we urge you, brothers and sisters, that you excel [in this matter] more and more, 















###### 11 







and to make it your ambition to live quietly _and_ peacefully, and to mind your own affairs and work with your hands, just as we directed you, 















###### 12 







so that you will behave properly toward outsiders [exhibiting good character, personal integrity, and moral courage worthy of the respect of the outside world], and be dependent on no one _and_ in need of nothing [be self-supporting]. ## Those Who Died in Christ 















###### 13 







Now we do not want you to be uninformed, believers, about those who are asleep [in death], so that you will not grieve [for them] as the others do who have no hope [beyond this present life]. 















###### 14 







For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again [as in fact He did], even so God [in this same way--by raising them from the dead] will bring with Him those [believers] who have fallen asleep in Jesus. 















###### 15 







For we say this to you by the Lord's [own] word, that we who are still alive and remain until the coming of the Lord, will in no way precede [into His presence] those [believers] who have fallen asleep [in death]. 















###### 16 







For the Lord Himself will come down from heaven with a shout of command, with the voice of the [^b]archangel and with the [blast of the] trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. 















###### 17 







Then we who are alive and remain [on the earth] will _simultaneously_ be caught up (raptured) together with them [the resurrected ones] in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord! 















###### 18 







Therefore comfort _and_ encourage one another with these words [concerning our reunion with believers who have died]. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

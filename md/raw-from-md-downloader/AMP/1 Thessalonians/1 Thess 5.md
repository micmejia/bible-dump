# 1 Thessalonians 5

***
















###### 1 







Now as to the [^a]times and dates, [^b]brothers and sisters, you have no need for anything to be written to you. 















###### 2 







For you yourselves know perfectly well that the day of the [return of the] Lord is coming just as a thief [comes unexpectedly and suddenly] in the night. 















###### 3 







While they are saying, "Peace and safety [all is well and secure!]" then [in a moment unforeseen] destruction will come upon them suddenly like labor pains on a woman with child, and they will absolutely not escape [for there will be no way to escape the judgment of the Lord]. 















###### 4 







But you, [^c]believers, [all you who believe in Christ as Savior and acknowledge Him as God's Son] are not in _spiritual_ darkness [nor held by its power], that the day [of judgment] would overtake you [by surprise] like a thief; 















###### 5 







for you are all sons of light and sons of day. We do not belong to the night nor to darkness. 















###### 6 







So then let us not sleep [in spiritual indifference] as the rest [of the world does], but let us keep wide awake [alert and cautious] and let us be sober [self-controlled, calm, and wise]. 















###### 7 







For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who are drunk get drunk at night. 















###### 8 







But since we [believers] belong to the day, let us be sober, having put on the breastplate of faith and love, and as a helmet, the hope _and_ confident assurance of salvation. 















###### 9 







For God has not destined us to [incur His] wrath [that is, He did not select us to condemn us], but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, 















###### 10 







who died [willingly] for us, so that whether we are awake (alive) or asleep (dead) [at Christ's appearing], we will live together with Him [sharing eternal life]. 















###### 11 







Therefore encourage _and_ comfort one another and build up one another, just as you are doing. ## Christian Conduct 















###### 12 







Now we ask you, brothers and sisters, to appreciate those who diligently work among you [recognize, acknowledge, and respect your leaders], who are in charge over you in the Lord and who give you instruction, 















###### 13 







and [we ask that you appreciate them and] hold them in the highest esteem in love because of their work [on your behalf]. Live in peace with one another. 















###### 14 







We [earnestly] urge you, believers, admonish those who are out of line [the undisciplined, the unruly, the disorderly], encourage the timid [who lack spiritual courage], help the [spiritually] weak, be very patient with everyone [always controlling your temper]. 















###### 15 







See that no one repays another with evil for evil, but always seek that which is good for one another and for all people. 















###### 16 







Rejoice always _and_ delight in your faith; 















###### 17 







be unceasing _and_ persistent in prayer; 















###### 18 







in every situation [no matter what the circumstances] be thankful _and_ continually give thanks _to God_; for this is the will of God for you in Christ Jesus. 















###### 19 







Do not quench [subdue, or be unresponsive to the working and guidance of] the [Holy] Spirit. 















###### 20 







Do not scorn _or_ reject gifts of prophecy _or_ prophecies [spoken revelations--words of instruction or exhortation or warning]. 















###### 21 







But test [^d]all things carefully [so you can recognize what is good]. Hold firmly to that which is good. 















###### 22 







Abstain from every form of evil [withdraw and keep away from it]. 















###### 23 







Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you through and through [that is, separate you from profane and vulgar things, make you pure and whole and undamaged--consecrated to Him--set apart for His purpose]; and may your spirit and soul and body be kept complete and [be found] blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 















###### 24 







Faithful _and_ absolutely trustworthy is He who is calling you [to Himself for your salvation], and He will do it [He will fulfill His call by making you holy, guarding you, watching over you, and protecting you as His own]. 















###### 25 







Brothers and sisters, pray for us. 















###### 26 







Greet all the believers with a holy [^e]kiss [as brothers and sisters in God's family]. 















###### 27 







I solemnly charge you by the Lord to have this letter read before all the [^f]congregation. 















###### 28

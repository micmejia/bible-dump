# 1 Timothy 1

***
















###### 1 







Paul, an apostle (special messenger, personally chosen representative) of Christ Jesus by the commandment of God our Savior, and of Christ Jesus (the Messiah, the Anointed) our Hope [the fulfillment of our salvation], 















###### 2 







to Timothy, my true son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace [inner calm and spiritual well-being] from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. 















###### 3 







As I urged you when I was on my way to Macedonia, stay on at Ephesus so that you may instruct certain individuals not to teach any different doctrines, 















###### 4 







nor to pay attention to legends (fables, myths) and endless genealogies, which give rise to useless speculation _and_ meaningless arguments rather than advancing God's program _of instruction_ which is grounded in faith [and requires surrendering the entire self to God in absolute trust and confidence]. 















###### 5 







But the goal of our instruction is love [which springs] from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith. 















###### 6 







Some individuals have wandered away from these things into empty arguments _and_ useless discussions, 















###### 7 







wanting to be teachers of the Law [of Moses], even though they do not understand the terms they use or the subjects about which they make [such] confident declarations. 















###### 8 







Now we know [without any doubt] that the Law is good, if one uses it lawfully _and_ appropriately, 















###### 9 







understanding the fact that law is not enacted for the righteous person [the one in right standing with God], but for lawless and rebellious people, for the ungodly and sinful, for the irreverent and profane, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers, 















###### 10 







for sexually immoral persons, for homosexuals, for [^a]kidnappers _and_ slave traders, for liars, for perjurers--and for whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine, 















###### 11 







according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, with which I have been entrusted. 















###### 12 







I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has granted me [the needed] strength _and_ made me able for this, because He considered me faithful _and_ trustworthy, putting me into service [for this ministry], 















###### 13 







even though I was formerly a blasphemer [of our Lord] and a persecutor [of His church] and a shameful _and_ outrageous _and_ violent aggressor [toward believers]. Yet I was shown mercy because I acted out of ignorance in unbelief. 















###### 14 







The grace of our Lord [His amazing, unmerited favor and blessing] flowed out in superabundance [for me, together] with the faith and love which are [realized] in Christ Jesus. 















###### 15 







[^b]This is a faithful _and_ trustworthy statement, deserving full acceptance _and_ approval, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, among whom I am foremost. 















###### 16 







Yet for this reason I found mercy, so that in me as the foremost [of sinners], Jesus Christ might demonstrate His perfect patience as an example _or_ pattern for those who [^c]would believe in Him for eternal life. 















###### 17 







Now to the King of the ages [eternal], immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen. 















###### 18 







This command I entrust to you, Timothy, my son, in accordance with the prophecies previously made concerning you, so that [inspired and aided] by them you may fight the good fight [in contending with false teachers], 















###### 19 







keeping your faith [leaning completely on God with absolute trust and confidence in His guidance] and having a good conscience; for some [people] have rejected [their moral compass] and have made a shipwreck of their faith. 















###### 20 







Among these are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have [^d]handed over to Satan, so that they will be disciplined _and_ taught not to blaspheme. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

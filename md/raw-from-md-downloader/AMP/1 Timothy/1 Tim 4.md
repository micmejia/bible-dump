# 1 Timothy 4

***
















###### 1 







But the [Holy] Spirit explicitly _and_ unmistakably declares that in later times some will turn away from the faith, paying attention instead to deceitful _and_ seductive spirits and doctrines of demons, 















###### 2 







[misled] by the hypocrisy of liars whose consciences are seared as with a branding iron [leaving them incapable of ethical functioning], 















###### 3 







who forbid marriage and _advocate_ abstaining from [certain kinds of] foods which God has created to be gratefully shared by those who believe and have [a clear] knowledge of the truth. 















###### 4 







For everything God has created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with gratitude; 















###### 5 







for it is sanctified [set apart, dedicated to God] by means of the word of God and prayer. ## A Good Minister's Discipline 















###### 6 







If you point out these instructions to the [^a]brothers and sisters, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, _constantly_ nourished [through study] on the words of the faith and of the good [Christian] doctrine which you have closely followed. 















###### 7 







But have nothing to do with irreverent folklore _and_ silly myths. On the other hand, discipline yourself for the purpose of godliness [keeping yourself spiritually fit]. 















###### 8 







For physical training is of some value, but godliness (spiritual training) is of value in everything _and_ in every way, since it holds promise for the present life and for the life to come. 















###### 9 







This is a faithful _and_ trustworthy saying worthy of full acceptance _and_ approval. 















###### 10 







It is for this that we labor and strive [often called to account], because we have fixed our [confident] hope on the living God, who is the [^b]Savior of all people, especially of those who believe [in Him, recognize Him as the Son of God, and accept Him as Savior and Lord]. 















###### 11 







Keep commanding and teaching these things. 















###### 12 







Let no one look down on [you because of] your youth, but be an example _and_ set a pattern for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, and in [moral] purity. 















###### 13 







Until I come, devote yourself to public reading [of Scripture], to preaching and to teaching [the sound doctrine of God's word]. 















###### 14 







Do not neglect the spiritual gift within you, [that special endowment] which was intentionally bestowed on you [by the Holy Spirit] through prophetic utterance when the [^c]elders laid their hands on you [at your ordination]. 















###### 15 







Practice _and_ work hard on these things; be absorbed in them [completely occupied in your ministry], so that your progress will be evident to all. 















###### 16 







Pay close attention to yourself [concentrate on your personal development] and to your teaching; persevere in these things [hold to them], for as you do this you will ensure salvation both for yourself and for those who hear you. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

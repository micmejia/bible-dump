# 1 Timothy 6

***
















###### 1 







All who are under the yoke as bond-servants (slaves) are to regard their own masters as worthy of honor _and_ respect so that the name of God and the teaching [about Him] will not be spoken against. 















###### 2 







Those who have believing masters are not to be disrespectful toward them because they are brothers [in Christ], but they should serve them even better, because those who benefit from their kindly service are believers and beloved. Teach and urge these [duties and principles]. 















###### 3 







If anyone teaches a different doctrine and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and with the doctrine _and_ teaching which is in agreement with godliness (personal integrity, upright behavior), 















###### 4 







he is conceited and woefully ignorant [understanding nothing]. He has a morbid interest in controversial questions and disputes about words, which produces envy, quarrels, verbal abuse, evil suspicions, 















###### 5 







and perpetual friction between men who are corrupted in mind and deprived of the truth, who think that godliness is a source of profit [a lucrative, money-making business--withdraw from them]. 















###### 6 







But godliness _actually_ is a source of great gain when accompanied by contentment [that contentment which comes from a sense of inner confidence based on the sufficiency of God]. 















###### 7 







For we have brought nothing into the world, so [it is clear that] we cannot take anything out of it, either. 















###### 8 







But if we have food and clothing, with these we will be content. 















###### 9 







But those who [are not financially ethical and] crave to get rich [with a compulsive, greedy longing for wealth] fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction [leading to personal misery]. 















###### 10 







For the love of money [that is, the greedy desire for it and the willingness to gain it unethically] is a root of all sorts of evil, and some by longing for it have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves [through and through] with many sorrows. 















###### 11 







But as for you, [^a]O man of God, flee from these things; aim at _and_ pursue righteousness [true goodness, moral conformity to the character of God], godliness [the fear of God], faith, love, steadfastness, and gentleness. 















###### 12 







Fight the good fight of the faith [in the conflict with evil]; take hold of the eternal life to which you were called, and [for which] you made the good confession [of faith] in the presence of many witnesses. 















###### 13 







I _solemnly_ charge you in the presence of God, who gives life to all things, and [in the presence] of Christ Jesus, who made the good confession [in His testimony] before Pontius Pilate, 















###### 14 







to keep all His precepts without stain or reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, 















###### 15 







which He will bring about in His own time--He who is the blessed and only Sovereign [the absolute Ruler], the King of those who reign as kings and Lord of those who rule as lords, 















###### 16 







He alone possesses immortality [absolute exemption from death] and lives in unapproachable light, whom no man has ever seen or can see. To Him be honor and eternal power _and_ dominion! Amen. 















###### 17 







As for the rich in this present world, instruct them not to be conceited _and_ arrogant, nor to set their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly _and_ ceaselessly provides us with everything for our enjoyment. 















###### 18 







_Instruct them_ to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous, willing to share [with others]. 















###### 19 







In this way storing up for themselves the _enduring_ riches of a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of that which is truly life. 















###### 20 







O Timothy, guard _and_ keep safe the deposit [of godly truth] entrusted to you, turn away from worldly and godless chatter [with its profane, empty words], and the contradictions of what is falsely called "knowledge"-- 















###### 21 







which some have professed and by doing so have erred (missed the mark) _and_ strayed from the faith.

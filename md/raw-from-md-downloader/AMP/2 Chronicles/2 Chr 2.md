# 2 Chronicles 2

***
















###### 1 







[^a]Now Solomon decided to build a house (temple) for the Name of the LORD, and a royal palace for himself. 















###### 2 







[^b]So Solomon assigned 70,000 men to carry loads, 80,000 men to quarry stone in the mountains, and 3,600 to supervise them. 















###### 3 







Then Solomon sent _word_ to [^c]Hiram king of Tyre, saying, "As you dealt with my father David and sent him cedars to build himself a house in which to live, [please] do the same for me. 















###### 4 







Observe, I am about to build a house for the Name of the LORD my God, dedicated to Him, to burn fragrant incense [of sweet spices] before Him, to set out the showbread continually, and to offer burnt offerings morning and evening, on Sabbaths, New Moons, and on the festivals of the LORD our God, as _ordained_ forever in Israel. 















###### 5 







The house I am going to build will be great, for our God is greater than all the gods. 















###### 6 







But who is able to build a house for Him, since the heavens and [even] the highest heavens cannot contain Him? Who am I to build a house for Him, except [as a place] to burn _incense_ before Him? 















###### 7 







Now send me a man who is skilled to work in gold, silver, bronze, and iron, and in purple, crimson, and blue _fabrics_, and who knows how to make engravings, _to work_ with the skilled men who are with me in Judah and Jerusalem, whom my father David provided. 















###### 8 







Send me also cedar, cypress, and [^d]algum timber, for I know that your servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon. And indeed my servants _will work_ with your servants 















###### 9 







to prepare for me an abundance of timber, because the house I am about to build will be great and wonderful. 















###### 10 







And I will give to your servants who cut timber, 20,000 [^e]measures of crushed wheat and 20,000 measures of barley, and 20,000 baths of wine and 20,000 baths of [olive] oil." ## Hiram to Assist 















###### 11 







Then Hiram, king of Tyre replied in a letter sent to Solomon: "Because the LORD loves His people, He has made you king over them." 















###### 12 







Hiram said also, "Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who made heaven and earth, who has given King David a wise son, endowed with discretion and understanding, who will build a house for the LORD and a royal palace for himself. 















###### 13 







"Now I am sending a skilled man, endowed with understanding, Huram-abi, 















###### 14 







the son of a [^f]Danite woman and a Tyrian father. He is trained to work in gold, silver, bronze, iron, stone, and wood; in purple, blue, and crimson fabrics, and in fine linen. He is able to make any kind of engraving and to carry out any design given him. _He will work_ with your skilled men and those of my lord, David your father. 















###### 15 







Now then, let my lord send to his servants the wheat, the barley, the oil, and the wine of which he has spoken. 















###### 16 







We will cut whatever timber you need from Lebanon and bring it to you on rafts by sea to Joppa, so that you may take it up to Jerusalem." 















###### 17 







Then Solomon took a count of all the aliens in the land of Israel, like the census that his father David had taken; and they were found to be 153,600. 















###### 18 







He assigned 70,000 of them to carry loads and 80,000 to quarry stone in the mountain, and 3,600 as overseers to make the people work. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# 2 Chronicles 3

***
















###### 1 







Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where the LORD appeared to his father David, in the place that David had prepared, on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. 















###### 2 







Solomon began to build on the second day of the second month in the fourth year of his reign. ## Dimensions and Materials of the Temple 















###### 3 







Now this is the [measurement of the] foundation which Solomon laid for the house of God: the length in cubits--by the old standard of measure--was sixty cubits (90 ft.), and the width was twenty cubits (30 ft.). 















###### 4 







The porch in front of the house was as long as the width of the house, twenty cubits, and the height was 120 cubits. He overlaid it inside with pure gold. 















###### 5 







He overlaid the main room [the Holy Place] with cypress wood and overlaid it with fine gold, and decorated it with palm trees and chains. 















###### 6 







And he adorned the house with precious stones; and the gold was gold from Parvaim. 















###### 7 







He also overlaid the house [the Holy Place] with gold--the beams, the thresholds, and its walls and its doors; and he carved cherubim on the walls. 















###### 8 







Now he made the room of the Holy of Holies: its length equaling the width of the house was twenty cubits, and its width was twenty cubits; and he overlaid it with 600 talents of fine gold. 















###### 9 







The weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. He also overlaid the upper rooms with gold. 















###### 10 







And in the Holy of Holies he made two sculptured cherubim, and overlaid them with gold. 















###### 11 







The wingspan of the cherubim was twenty cubits: one wing of one cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house, and its other wing, of five cubits, touched the other cherub's wing. 















###### 12 







The wing of the other cherub, of five cubits, touched the wall of the house; and its other wing of five cubits touched the wing of the first cherub. 















###### 13 







The wings of these cherubim extended twenty cubits. The cherubim stood on their feet, their faces toward the Holy Place (the main room). 















###### 14 







He made the veil [between the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies] of blue, purple, and crimson colors, and [^a]fine linen, and embroidered cherubim on it. 















###### 15 







He also made two pillars for the front of the house, thirty-five cubits high, and the capital on the top of each one was five cubits. 















###### 16 







He made chains [like a necklace] in the inner sanctuary and put them on the tops of the pillars; and he made a hundred pomegranates and put them on the chains. 















###### 17 







He erected the pillars in front of the temple, one on the right, the other on the left, and named the one on the right Jachin (may He establish) and the one on the left Boaz (in Him is strength). ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

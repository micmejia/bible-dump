# 2 Corinthians 2

***
















###### 1 







But I made up my mind not to grieve you with another painful visit. 















###### 2 







For if I cause you grief [by a well-deserved rebuke], who then provides me enjoyment but the very one whom I have made sad? 















###### 3 







And I [^a]wrote this same thing to you, so that when I came, I would not be filled with sorrow by those who ought to make me glad, for I trusted in you _and_ felt confident that my joy would be shared by all of you. 















###### 4 







For I wrote to you out of great distress and with an anguished heart, and with many tears, not to cause you sorrow but to make you realize the [overflowing] love which I have especially for you. 















###### 5 







But if [^b]someone has caused [all this] sorrow, he has caused it not to me, but in some degree--not to put it too severely--[he has distressed and grieved] all of you. 















###### 6 







For such a one this punishment by the majority is sufficient, 















###### 7 







so instead [of further rebuke, now] you should rather [graciously] forgive and comfort _and_ encourage him, to keep him from being overwhelmed by excessive sorrow. 















###### 8 







Therefore I urge you to reinstate him in your affections _and_ reaffirm your [^c]love for him. 















###### 9 







For this was my purpose in writing, to see if you would stand the test, whether you are obedient _and_ committed to following my instruction in all things. 















###### 10 







If you forgive anyone anything, I too forgive [that one]; and what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, has been for your sake in the presence of [and with the approval of] Christ, 















###### 11 







to keep Satan from taking advantage of us; for we are not ignorant of his schemes. 















###### 12 







Now when I arrived at Troas to _preach_ the good news of Christ, even though a door [of opportunity] opened for me in the Lord, 















###### 13 







my spirit could not rest because I did not find my brother Titus _there_; so saying goodbye to them, I left for Macedonia. 















###### 14 







But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and through us spreads _and_ makes evident everywhere the sweet fragrance of the knowledge of Him. 















###### 15 







For we are the _sweet_ fragrance of Christ [which ascends] to God, [discernible both] among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing; 















###### 16 







to the _latter_ one an aroma from death to death [a fatal, offensive odor], but to the other an aroma from life to life [a vital fragrance, living and fresh]. And who is adequate _and_ sufficiently qualified for these things? 















###### 17 







For we are not like many, [acting like merchants] peddling God's word [shortchanging and adulterating God's message]; but from pure [uncompromised] motives, as [commissioned and sent] from God, we speak [His message] in Christ in the sight of God. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: 2 Corinthians 2:5 The incident and offender to which Paul is referring is unclear, but it may have involved some affront or challenge to Paulâ€™s position or authority during his visit to Corinth. [^c]: 2 Corinthians 2:8 The key to understanding this and other statements about love is to know that this love (the Greek word _agape_) is not so much a matter of emotion as it is of doing things for the benefit of another person, that is, having an unselfish concern for another and a willingness to seek the best for other believers.

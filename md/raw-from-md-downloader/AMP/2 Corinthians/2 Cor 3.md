# 2 Corinthians 3

***
















###### 1 







Are we starting to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, like some [false teachers], letters of recommendation to you or from you? [No!] 















###### 2 







You are our letter [of recommendation], written in our hearts, recognized and read by everyone. 















###### 3 







You show that you are a letter from Christ, delivered by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts. 















###### 4 







Such is the confidence _and_ steadfast reliance _and_ absolute trust that we have through Christ toward God. 















###### 5 







Not that we are sufficiently qualified in ourselves to claim anything as _coming_ from us, but our sufficiency _and_ qualifications come from God. 















###### 6 







He has qualified us [making us sufficient] as ministers of a new covenant [of salvation through Christ], not of the letter [of a written code] but of the Spirit; for the letter [of the Law] kills [by revealing sin and demanding obedience], but the Spirit gives life. 















###### 7 







Now if the ministry of death, engraved in letters on stones [the covenant of the Law which led to death because of sin], came with such glory _and_ splendor that the Israelites were not able to look steadily at the face of Moses because of its glory, [a brilliance] that was fading, 















###### 8 







how will the ministry of the Spirit [the new covenant which allows us to be Spirit-filled] fail to be even more glorious _and_ splendid? 















###### 9 







For if the ministry that brings condemnation [the old covenant, the Law] has glory, how much more does glory overflow in the ministry that brings righteousness [the new covenant which declares believers free of guilt and sets them apart for God's special purpose]! 















###### 10 







Indeed, what had glory [the Law], in this case no longer has glory because of the glory that surpasses it [the gospel]. 















###### 11 







For if that [Law] which fades away _came_ with glory, _how_ much more _must_ that [gospel] which remains _and_ is permanent abide in glory _and_ splendor! 















###### 12 







Since we have such a [glorious] hope _and_ confident expectation, we speak with great courage, 















###### 13 







and we are not like Moses, _who_ used to put a veil over his face so that the Israelites would not gaze at the end of the glory which was fading away. 















###### 14 







But [in fact] their minds were hardened [for they had lost the ability to understand]; for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remains unlifted, because it is removed [only] in Christ. 















###### 15 







But to this day whenever Moses is read, a veil [of blindness] lies over their heart; 















###### 16 







but whenever a person turns [in repentance and faith] to the Lord, the veil is taken away. 















###### 17 







Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, _there_ is liberty [emancipation from bondage, true freedom]. 















###### 18 







And we all, with unveiled face, _continually_ seeing as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are _progressively_ being transformed into His image from [one degree of] glory to [even more] glory, which comes from the Lord, [who is] the Spirit. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

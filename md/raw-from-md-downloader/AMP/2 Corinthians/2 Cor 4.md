# 2 Corinthians 4

***
















###### 1 







Therefore, since we have this ministry, just as we received mercy [from God, granting us salvation, opportunities, and blessings], we do not get discouraged _nor_ lose our motivation. 















###### 2 







But we have renounced the disgraceful things hidden because of shame; not walking in trickery or adulterating the word of God, but by stating the truth [openly and plainly], we commend ourselves to everyone's conscience in the sight of God. 















###### 3 







But even if our gospel is [in some sense] hidden [behind a veil], it is hidden [only] to those who are perishing; 















###### 4 







among them the god of this world [Satan] has blinded the minds of the unbelieving to prevent them from seeing the illuminating light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. 















###### 5 







For we do not preach ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves [merely] as your bond-servants for Jesus' sake. 















###### 6 







For God, who said, "Let light shine out of darkness," is the One who has shone in our hearts to give us the Light of the knowledge of the glory _and_ majesty of God [clearly revealed] in the face of Christ. 















###### 7 







But we have this _precious_ treasure [the good news about salvation] in [unworthy] earthen vessels [of human frailty], so that the grandeur _and_ surpassing greatness of the power will be [shown to be] from God [His sufficiency] and not from ourselves. 















###### 8 







We are pressured in every way [hedged in], but not crushed; perplexed [unsure of finding a way out], but not driven to despair; 















###### 9 







hunted down _and_ persecuted, but not deserted [to stand alone]; struck down, but never destroyed; 















###### 10 







always carrying around in the body the dying of Jesus, so that the [resurrection] life of Jesus also may be shown in our body. 















###### 11 







For we who live are constantly [experiencing the threat of] being handed over to death for Jesus' sake, so that the [resurrection] life of Jesus also may be evidenced in our mortal body [which is subject to death]. 















###### 12 







So _physical_ death is [actively] at work in us, but [spiritual] life [is actively at work] in you. 















###### 13 







Yet we have the same spirit of faith as he had, who wrote _in Scripture_, "I believed, therefore I spoke." We also believe, therefore we also speak, 















###### 14 







knowing that He who raised the Lord Jesus will also raise us with Jesus and will present us [along] with you in His presence. 















###### 15 







For all [these] things are for your sake, so that as [God's remarkable, undeserved] grace reaches to more and more people it may increase thanksgiving, to the glory of [our great] God. 















###### 16 







Therefore we do not become discouraged [spiritless, disappointed, or afraid]. Though our outer self is [progressively] wasting away, yet our inner _self_ is being [progressively] renewed day by day. 















###### 17 







For our momentary, light distress [this passing trouble] is producing for us an eternal weight of glory [a fullness] beyond all measure [surpassing all comparisons, a transcendent splendor and an endless blessedness]! 















###### 18 







So we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are unseen; for the things which are visible are temporal [just brief and fleeting], but the things which are invisible are everlasting _and_ imperishable. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# 2 Corinthians 6

***
















###### 1 







Working together _with Him_, we strongly urge you not to receive God's grace in vain [by turning away from sound doctrine and His merciful kindness]. 















###### 2 







For He says, "At the acceptable time (the time of grace) I listened to you, And I helped you on the day of salvation." Behold, now is "the acceptable time," behold, now is "the day of salvation"-- 















###### 3 







we put no obstruction in anyone's path, so that the ministry will not be discredited, 















###### 4 







but we commend ourselves in every way as servants of God: in great endurance, in sufferings, in hardships, in distresses, 















###### 5 







in beatings, in imprisonments, in riots, in labors, in sleepless nights, in hunger, 















###### 6 







in purity _and_ sincerity, in knowledge _and_ spiritual insight, in patience, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in genuine love, 















###### 7 







in [speaking] the word of truth, in the power of God; by the weapons of righteousness for the right hand [like holding the sword to attack] and for the left [like holding the shield to defend], 















###### 8 







amid glory and dishonor; by evil report and good report; _branded_ as deceivers and yet [vindicated as] truthful; 















###### 9 







as unknown [to the world], yet well-known [by God and His people]; as dying, yet we live; as punished, yet not killed; 















###### 10 







as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet bestowing riches on many; as having nothing, yet possessing all things. 















###### 11 







We are speaking freely to you, Corinthians [we are keeping nothing back], and our heart is opened wide. 















###### 12 







There is no limit to our affection for you, but you are limited in your own affection [for us]. 















###### 13 







Now in the same way as a fair exchange [for our love toward you]--I am speaking as [I would] to children--open wide [your hearts] _to us_ also. 















###### 14 







Do not be unequally bound together with unbelievers [do not make mismatched alliances with them, inconsistent with your faith]. For what partnership can righteousness have with lawlessness? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness? 















###### 15 







What harmony can there be between Christ and Belial (Satan)? Or what does a believer have in common with an unbeliever? 















###### 16 







What agreement is there between the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God; just as God said: "I will dwell among them and walk among them; And I will be their God, and they shall be My people. 















###### 17 







"So come out from among unbelievers and be separate," says the Lord, "And do not touch what is unclean; And I will graciously receive you _and_ welcome you [with favor], 















###### 18 







And I will be a Father to you, And you will be My sons and daughters," Says the Lord Almighty. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# 2 Corinthians 9

***
















###### 1 







Now it is unnecessary for me to write to you about the offering [that is to be made] for the saints [in Jerusalem]; 















###### 2 







for I know your eagerness [to promote this cause], and I have [proudly] boasted to the people of Macedonia about it, telling them that [^a]Achaia has been prepared since last year [for this contribution], and your enthusiasm has inspired the majority of them [to respond]. 















###### 3 







Still, I am sending the brothers [on to you], so that our pride in you may not be an empty boast in this case, and so that you may be prepared, just as I told them you would be; 















###### 4 







otherwise, if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we--to say nothing of yourselves--will be humiliated for being so confident. 















###### 5 







That is why I thought it necessary to urge these brothers to go to you [before I come] and make arrangements in advance for this generous, previously promised gift of yours, so that it would be ready, not as something extorted [or wrung out of you], but as a [voluntary and] generous gift. 















###### 6 







Now [remember] this: he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows [^b]generously [that blessings may come to others] will also reap [^c]generously [and be blessed]. 















###### 7 







Let each one give [thoughtfully and with purpose] just as he has decided in his heart, not grudgingly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver [and delights in the one whose heart is in his gift]. 















###### 8 







And God is able to make all grace [every favor and earthly blessing] come in abundance to you, so that you may always [under all circumstances, regardless of the need] have complete sufficiency in everything [being completely self-sufficient in Him], and have an abundance for every good work _and_ act of charity. 















###### 9 







As it is written _and_ forever remains written, "He [the benevolent and generous person] scattered abroad, he gave to the poor, His righteousness endures forever!" 















###### 10 







Now He who provides seed for the sower and bread for food will provide and multiply your seed for sowing [that is, your resources] and increase the harvest of your righteousness [which shows itself in active goodness, kindness, and love]. 















###### 11 







You will be enriched in every way so that you may be generous, and this [generosity, administered] through us is producing thanksgiving to God [from those who benefit]. 















###### 12 







For the ministry of this service (offering) is not only supplying the needs of the saints (God's people), but is also overflowing through many expressions of thanksgiving to God. 















###### 13 







Because of this act of ministry, [^d]they will glorify God for your obedience to the gospel of Christ which you confess, as well as for your generous participation [in this gift] for them and for all [the other believers in need], 















###### 14 







and they also long for you while they pray on your behalf, because of the surpassing measure of God's grace [His undeserved favor, mercy, and blessing which is revealed] in you. 















###### 15 







Now thanks be to God for His indescribable gift [which is precious beyond words]! ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

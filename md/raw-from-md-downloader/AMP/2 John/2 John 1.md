# 2 John 1

***
















###### 1 







The elder [of the church addresses this letter] to the elect (chosen) [^a]lady and her children, whom I love in truth--and not only I, but also all who know _and_ understand the truth-- 















###### 2 







because of the truth which lives in our hearts and will be with us forever: 















###### 3 







Grace, mercy, and peace (inner calm, a sense of spiritual well-being) will be with us, from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Father's Son, in truth and love. 















###### 4 







I was greatly delighted to find _some_ of your children walking in truth, just as we have been commanded by the Father. 















###### 5 







Now I ask you, lady, not as if _I were_ writing to you a new commandment, but [simply reminding you of] the one which we have had from the beginning, that we [^b]love _and_ unselfishly seek the best for one another. 















###### 6 







And this is love: that we walk in accordance with His commandments _and_ are guided continually by His precepts. This is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, that you should [always] walk in love. 















###### 7 







For many deceivers [heretics, posing as Christians] have gone out into the world, those who do not acknowledge _and_ confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh (bodily form). This [person, the kind who does this] is the deceiver and the [^c]antichrist [that is, the antagonist of Christ]. 















###### 8 







Watch yourselves, so that you do not lose what we have accomplished together, but that you may receive a full _and_ perfect reward [when He grants rewards to faithful believers]. 















###### 9 







Anyone who runs on ahead and does not remain in the doctrine of Christ [that is, one who is not content with what He taught], does not have God; but the one who _continues_ to remain in the teaching [of Christ does have God], he has both the Father and the Son. 















###### 10 







If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching [but diminishes or adds to the doctrine of Christ], do not receive _or_ welcome him into your house, and do not give him a greeting _or_ any encouragement; 















###### 11 







for the one who gives him a greeting [who encourages him or wishes him success, unwittingly] participates in his evil deeds. 















###### 12 







I have many things to write to you, but I prefer not to do so with paper (papyrus) and black (ink); but I hope to come to you and speak with you [^d]face to face, so that [^e]your joy may be complete. 















###### 13 







The children of your elect (chosen) sister greet you. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: 2 John 1:5 The key to understanding this and other statements about love is to know that this love (the Greek word _agape_) is not so much a matter of emotion as it is of doing things for the benefit of another person, that is, having an unselfish concern for another and a willingness to seek the best for another. [^c]: 2 John 1:7 John is not referring to the Antichrist of Revelation, but is using the term generally of anyone who is opposed to the cause of Christ. [^d]: 2 John 1:12 Lit _mouth to mouth_. [^e]: 2 John 1:12 One early ms reads _our_.

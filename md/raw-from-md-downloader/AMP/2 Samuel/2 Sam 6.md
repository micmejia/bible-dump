# 2 Samuel 6

***
















###### 1 







Again David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand. 















###### 2 







And David arose and went with all those who were with him to Baale-judah [Kiriath-jearim], to bring up from there [to Jerusalem] the ark of God which is called by the Name--the very Name of the LORD of hosts, who dwells enthroned _above_ the cherubim. 















###### 3 







They placed the ark of God on [^a]a new cart and brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill; and Uzzah and Ahio, sons of Abinadab, were leading the new cart. 















###### 4 







So they brought it with the ark of God from the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill; and Ahio was walking in front of the ark. 















###### 5 







Meanwhile, David and all the house of Israel were celebrating _and_ dancing before the LORD with all kinds of _instruments made of_ fir _or_ cypress wood, with lyres, harps, tambourines, castanets, and cymbals. 















###### 6 







When they came to Nacon's threshing floor, Uzzah reached out [with his hand] to the ark of God and took hold of it, because the oxen [stumbled and] nearly overturned it. 















###### 7 







And [^b]the anger of the LORD burned against Uzzah, and God struck him there for his irreverence; and he died there by the ark of God. 















###### 8 







David became [^c]angry _and_ grieved _and_ offended because of the Lord's outburst against Uzzah, and that place has been called Perez-uzzah (outburst against Uzzah) to this day. 















###### 9 







So David was afraid of the LORD that day; and he said, "How can the ark of the LORD come to me?" 















###### 10 







David was unwilling to move the ark of the LORD into the City of David with him; instead he took it aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite. 















###### 11 







So the ark of the LORD remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite for three months, and the LORD blessed Obed-edom and all his household (family). ## The Ark Is Brought to Jerusalem 















###### 12 







Now King David was told, "The LORD has blessed the house of Obed-edom and all that belongs to him, because of the ark of God." So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the City of David with rejoicing _and_ gladness. 















###### 13 







And when those who were carrying the ark of the LORD [by its poles] had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fatling. 















###### 14 







And David was dancing before the LORD with [^d]great enthusiasm, and David was [^e]wearing a linen ephod [a priest's upper garment]. 















###### 15 







So David and all the house of Israel were bringing the ark of the LORD up [to the City of David] with shouts [of joy] and with the sound of the trumpet. 















###### 16 







Then, as the ark of the LORD came into the City of David, [^f]Michal, Saul's daughter [David's wife], looked down from the window above and saw King David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she felt contempt for him in her heart [because she thought him undignified]. 















###### 17 







They brought in the ark of the LORD and set it in its place inside the tent which David had pitched for it; and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD. 















###### 18 







When David had finished offering the burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts (armies), 















###### 19 







and distributed to all the people, the entire multitude of Israel, both to men and women, to each a [ring-shaped] loaf of bread, a cake of dates, and a cake of raisins. Then all the people departed, each to his house. 















###### 20 







Then David returned to bless his household. But [his wife] Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David and said, "How glorious _and_ distinguished was the king of Israel today, [^g]who uncovered himself _and_ stripped [off his kingly robes] in the eyes of his servants' maids like one of the riffraff who shamelessly uncovers himself!" 















###### 21 







So David said to Michal, "It was before the LORD [that I did this], who chose me above your father and all his house, to appoint me as ruler over Israel, the people of the LORD. Therefore I will celebrate [in pure enjoyment] before the LORD. 















###### 22 







Yet I will demean myself _even_ more than this, and will be humbled (abased) in my own sight [and yours, as I please], but by the maids whom you mentioned, by them I shall be held in honor." 















###### 23 







Michal the daughter of Saul had no [^h]child to the day of her death. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: 2 Samuel 6:7 Lit _the nose of the _Lord_ was hot._ [^c]: 2 Samuel 6:8 Lit _hot_. [^d]: 2 Samuel 6:14 Lit _all his might_. [^e]: 2 Samuel 6:14 Lit _girded with_. [^f]: 2 Samuel 6:16 Michal failed to understand the significance of the event unfolding beneath her window. [^g]: 2 Samuel 6:20 Instead of royal apparel, David dressed himself in a priest’s linen ephod. [^h]: 2 Samuel 6:23 At this time being childless was a social stigma and often considered an act of divine judgment. Her failure to produce a child prevented Saul’s line from being continued through David.

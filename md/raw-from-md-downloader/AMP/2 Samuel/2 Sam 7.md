# 2 Samuel 7

***
















###### 1 







When King David lived in his house (palace) and the LORD had given him rest from all his surrounding enemies, 















###### 2 







the king said to Nathan the prophet, "See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells within tent curtains." 















###### 3 







And Nathan said to the king, "Go, do everything that is in your heart, for the LORD is with you." 















###### 4 







But it happened that night that the word of the LORD came to Nathan, saying, 















###### 5 







"Go and tell My servant David, 'Thus says the LORD, "Should you be the one to build Me a house in which to dwell? 















###### 6 







For I have not dwelt in a house since the day I brought the sons (descendants) of Israel up from Egypt, even to this day; but I have been moving about in a tent, even in a tabernacle. 















###### 7 







Wherever I have gone with all the Israelites, did I speak a word to any from the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd My people Israel, asking, 'Why have you not built Me a house of cedar?'"' ## God's Covenant with David 















###### 8 







So now, say this to My servant David, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, "I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, to be ruler over My people Israel. 















###### 9 







I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have cut off all your enemies from before you; and I will make you a great name, like that of the great men of the earth. 















###### 10 







I will appoint a place for My people Israel and will plant them, so that they may live in a place of their own and not be disturbed again. The [^a]wicked will not afflict them again, as formerly, 















###### 11 







even from the day that I appointed judges over My people Israel; and I will give you rest from all your enemies. The LORD also declares to you that He will make a house (royal dynasty) for you. 















###### 12 







When your days are fulfilled and you lie down [in death] with your fathers (ancestors), I will raise up your descendant after you, who shall be born to you, and I will establish his kingdom. 















###### 13 







He [is the one who] shall build a house for My [^b]Name _and_ My Presence, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. 















###### 14 







I will be his Father, and he shall be My son. When he commits iniquity (wrongdoing), I will discipline him with the rod of men and with the strokes of the sons of man. 















###### 15 







But My lovingkindness _and_ mercy will not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I removed from before you. 















###### 16 







Your house (royal dynasty) and your kingdom will endure forever before Me; your throne will be established forever."'" 















###### 17 







Nathan spoke to David in accordance with all these words and all of this vision. ## David's Prayer 















###### 18 







Then King David went in and sat [in prayer] before the LORD, and said, "Who am I, O Lord [^c]God, and what is my house (family), that You have brought me this far? 















###### 19 







Yet this was very insignificant in Your eyes, O Lord God, for You have spoken also of Your servant's house (royal dynasty) in the distant future. And this is the law _and_ custom of man, O Lord God. 















###### 20 







What more can David say to You? For You know (acknowledge, choose) Your servant, O Lord God. 















###### 21 







Because of Your word (promise), and in accordance with Your own heart, You have done all these great _and_ astounding things to let Your servant know (understand). 















###### 22 







Therefore You are great, O Lord God; for there is none like You, and there is no God besides You, according to all that we have heard with our ears. 















###### 23 







What one nation on earth is like Your people Israel, whom God went to redeem for Himself as a people and to make a name for Himself, and to do great and awesome things for Yourself and for Your land, before Your people whom You have redeemed for Yourself from Egypt, _from_ nations and their gods? 















###### 24 







You established for Yourself Your people Israel as Your people forever, and You, O LORD, have become their God. 















###### 25 







Now, O LORD God, confirm forever the word [of the covenant] that You have spoken in regard to Your servant and his house (royal dynasty); and do just as You have spoken, 















###### 26 







so that Your Name may be magnified forever, saying, 'The LORD of hosts (armies) is God over Israel;' and may the house (royal dynasty) of Your servant David be established [^d]before You. 















###### 27 







For You, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, have [^e]revealed this to Your servant, saying, 'I will build you a house (royal dynasty).' For that reason Your servant has found [^f]courage to pray this prayer to You. 















###### 28 







And now, O Lord God, You are God, and Your words are truth, and You have promised this good thing to Your servant. 















###### 29 







Therefore now, may it please You to bless the house (royal dynasty) of Your servant, so that it may continue forever before You; for You, O Lord God, have spoken it, and with Your blessing may the house of Your servant be blessed forever." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

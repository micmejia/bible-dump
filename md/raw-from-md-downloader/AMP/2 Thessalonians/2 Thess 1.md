# 2 Thessalonians 1

***
















###### 1 







Paul, Silvanus (Silas), and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: 















###### 2 







Grace to you and peace [inner calm and spiritual well-being] from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 















###### 3 







We ought always _and_ indeed are morally obligated [as those in debt] to give thanks to God for you, [^a]brothers and sisters, as is fitting, because your faith is growing ever greater, and the [unselfish] [^b]love of each one of you toward one another is continually increasing. 















###### 4 







Therefore, we speak of you with pride among the churches of God for your steadfastness [your unflinching endurance, and patience] and your firm faith in the midst of all the persecution and [crushing] distress which you endure. 















###### 5 







_This is_ a positive proof of the righteous judgment of God [a sign of His fair verdict], so that you will be considered worthy of His kingdom, for which indeed you are suffering. 















###### 6 







For after all it is _only_ just for God to repay with distress those who distress you, 















###### 7 







and to _give_ relief to you who are so distressed and to us as well when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with His mighty angels in a flame of fire, 















###### 8 







dealing out [full and complete] vengeance to those who do not [seek to] know God and to those who ignore _and_ refuse to obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus [by choosing not to respond to Him]. 















###### 9 







These people will pay the penalty _and_ endure the punishment of [^c]everlasting destruction, banished from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power, 















###### 10 







when He comes to be glorified in His saints on that day [that is, glorified through the changed lives of those who have accepted Him as Savior and have been set apart for His purpose], and to be marveled at among all who have believed, because our testimony to you was believed _and_ trusted [and confirmed in your lives]. 















###### 11 







With this in view, we constantly pray for you, that our God will count you worthy of your calling [to faith] and with [His] power fulfill every desire for goodness, and complete [your] every work of faith, 















###### 12 







so that the name of our Lord Jesus will be glorified in you [by what you do], and you in Him, according to the [precious] grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: 2 Thessalonians 1:3 The key to understanding this and other statements about love is to know that this love (the Greek word _agape_) is not so much a matter of emotion as it is of doing things for the benefit of another person, that is, having an unselfish concern for another and a willingness to seek the best for another. [^c]: 2 Thessalonians 1:9 Not annihilation, but the loss of all meaningful things.

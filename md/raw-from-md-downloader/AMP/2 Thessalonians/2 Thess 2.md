# 2 Thessalonians 2

***
















###### 1 







Now in regard to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our [^a]gathering together to _meet_ Him, we ask you, [^b]brothers and sisters, 















###### 2 







not to be quickly unsettled or alarmed either by a [so-called prophetic revelation of a] spirit or a message or a letter [alleged to be] from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has [already] come. 















###### 3 







Let no one in any way deceive _or_ entrap you, for _that day will not come_ unless the [^c]apostasy comes first [that is, the great rebellion, the abandonment of the faith by professed Christians], and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction [the Antichrist, the one who is destined to be destroyed], 















###### 4 







who opposes and exalts himself [so proudly and so insolently] above [^d]every so-called god or object of worship, so that he [actually enters and] takes his seat in the temple of God, publicly proclaiming that he himself is God. 















###### 5 







Do you not remember that when I was still with you, I was telling you these things? 















###### 6 







And you know what restrains him now [from being revealed]; it is so that he will be revealed at his own [appointed] time. 















###### 7 







For the mystery of lawlessness [rebellion against divine authority and the coming reign of lawlessness] is already at work; [but it is restrained] only until he who now restrains it is taken out of the way. 















###### 8 







Then the lawless one [the Antichrist] will be revealed and the Lord Jesus will slay him with the breath of His mouth and bring him to an end by the appearance of His coming. 















###### 9 







The coming of the [Antichrist, the lawless] one is through the activity of Satan, [attended] with great power [all kinds of counterfeit miracles] and [deceptive] signs and false wonders [all of them lies], 















###### 10 







and by unlimited seduction to evil _and_ with all the deception of wickedness for those who are perishing, because they did not welcome the love of the truth [of the gospel] so as to be saved [they were spiritually blind, and rejected the truth that would have saved them]. 















###### 11 







Because of this God will send upon them a misleading influence, [an activity of error and deception] so they will believe the lie, 















###### 12 







in order that all may be judged _and_ condemned who did not believe the truth [about their sin, and the need for salvation through Christ], but _instead_ took pleasure in unrighteousness. 















###### 13 







But we should _and_ are [morally] obligated [as debtors] always to give thanks to God for you, believers beloved by the Lord, because God has chosen you from the beginning for salvation through the [^e]sanctifying work of the Spirit [that sets you apart for God's purpose] and by your faith in the truth [of God's word that leads you to spiritual maturity]. 















###### 14 







It was to this end that He called you through our gospel [the good news of Jesus' death, burial, and resurrection], so that you may obtain _and_ share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. 















###### 15 







So then, [^f]brothers and sisters, stand firm and hold [tightly] to the traditions which you were taught, whether by word _of mouth_ or by letter from us. 















###### 16 







Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself and God our Father, who has loved us and given us everlasting comfort _and_ encouragement and the good [well-founded] hope [of salvation] by _His_ grace, 















###### 17 







comfort _and_ encourage and strengthen your hearts [keeping them steadfast and on course] in every good work and word. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# 2 Thessalonians 3

***
















###### 1 







Finally, brothers and sisters, pray _continually_ for us that the word of the Lord will spread rapidly and be honored [triumphantly celebrated and glorified], just as it was with you; 















###### 2 







and [pray] that we will be rescued from perverse and evil men; for not everyone has the faith. 















###### 3 







But the Lord is faithful, and He will strengthen you [setting you on a firm foundation] and will protect _and_ guard you from the evil _one_. 















###### 4 







We have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that you are doing and will _continue_ to do the things [which] we command. 















###### 5 







May the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the steadfastness _and_ patience of Christ. 















###### 6 







Now we command you, believers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ _and_ by His authority, that you withdraw _and_ keep away from every brother or sister who leads an undisciplined life and does not live in accordance with the tradition _and_ teaching that [^a]you have received from us. 















###### 7 







For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example, because we did not act in an undisciplined _or_ inappropriate manner when we were with you [we were never idle or lazy, nor did we avoid our duties], 















###### 8 







nor did we eat anyone's bread without paying for it, but with labor and hardship we worked night and day [to pay our own way] so that we would not be a _financial_ burden on any of you [for our support]; 















###### 9 







not because we do not have a right _to such support_, but [we provided our own financial support] to offer ourselves as a model for you, so that you would follow our example. 















###### 10 







For even while we were with you, we used to give you this order: if anyone is not willing to work, then he is [^b]not to eat, either. 















###### 11 







Indeed, we hear that some among you are leading an undisciplined _and_ inappropriate life, doing no work at all, but acting like busybodies [meddling in other people's business]. 















###### 12 







Now such people we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ to settle down _and_ work quietly and earn their own food _and_ other necessities [supporting themselves instead of depending on the hospitality of others]. 















###### 13 







And as for [the rest of] you, [^c]believers, do not grow tired _or_ lose heart in doing good [but continue doing what is right without weakening]. 















###### 14 







Now if anyone [in the church] does not obey what we say in this letter, take special note of that person and do not associate with him, so that he will be ashamed _and_ repent. 















###### 15 







Do not regard him as an enemy, but keep admonishing him as a [believing] brother. 















###### 16 







Now may the Lord of peace Himself grant you His peace at all times _and_ in every way [that peace and spiritual well-being that comes to those who walk with Him, regardless of life's circumstances]. The Lord be with you all. 















###### 17 







I, Paul, write you this final greeting with my own hand. This is the distinguishing mark in every letter [of mine, that shows it is genuine]. It is the way I write [my handwriting and signature]. 















###### 18 







The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

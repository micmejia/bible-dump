# 2 Timothy 1

***
















###### 1 







Paul, an apostle (special messenger, personally chosen representative) of Christ Jesus (the Messiah, the Anointed) by the will of God, according to the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus, 















###### 2 







to Timothy, my beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace [inner calm and spiritual well-being] from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. 















###### 3 







I thank God, whom I worship _and_ serve with a clear conscience the way my forefathers did, as I constantly remember you in my prayers night and day, 















###### 4 







and as I recall your tears, I long to see you so that I may be filled with joy. 















###### 5 







I remember your sincere _and_ unqualified faith [the surrendering of your entire self to God in Christ with confident trust in His power, wisdom and goodness, a faith] which first lived in [the heart of] your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am confident that it is in you as well. 















###### 6 







That is why I remind you to [^a]fan into flame the gracious gift of God, [that inner fire--the special endowment] which is in you through the laying on of my hands [with those of the elders at your ordination]. 















###### 7 







For God did not give us a spirit of timidity _or_ cowardice _or_ fear, but [He has given us a spirit] of power and of love and of sound judgment _and_ personal discipline [abilities that result in a calm, well-balanced mind and self-control]. 















###### 8 







So do not be ashamed to testify about our Lord or about me His prisoner, but with me take your share of suffering for the gospel [continue to preach regardless of the circumstances], in accordance with the power of God [for His power is invincible], 















###### 9 







for He delivered us _and_ saved us and called us with a holy calling [a calling that leads to a consecrated life--a life set apart--a life of purpose], not because of our works [or because of any personal merit--we could do nothing to earn this], but because of His own purpose and grace [His amazing, undeserved favor] which was granted to us in Christ Jesus before the world began [eternal ages ago], 















###### 10 







but now [that extraordinary purpose and grace] has been fully disclosed _and_ realized by us through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus who [through His incarnation and earthly ministry] abolished death [making it null and void] and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel, 















###### 11 







for which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher [of this good news regarding salvation]. 















###### 12 







This is why I suffer as I do. Still, I am not ashamed; for I know Him [and I am personally acquainted with Him] whom I have believed [with absolute trust and confidence in Him and in the truth of His deity], and I am persuaded [beyond any doubt] that He is able to guard that which I have entrusted to Him until [^b]that day [when I stand before Him]. 















###### 13 







Keep _and_ follow the pattern of sound teaching (doctrine) which you have heard from me, in the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus. 















###### 14 







Guard [with greatest care] _and_ keep unchanged, the treasure [that precious truth] which has been entrusted to you [that is, the good news about salvation through personal faith in Christ Jesus], through [the help of] the Holy Spirit who dwells in us. 















###### 15 







You are aware of the fact that all who are in [the province of] Asia turned away _and_ deserted me, Phygelus and Hermogenes among them. 















###### 16 







The Lord grant mercy to the family of Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me _and_ showed me kindness [comforting and reviving me like fresh air] and he was not ashamed of my chains [for Christ's sake]; 















###### 17 







but [instead] when he reached Rome, he eagerly searched for me and found me-- 















###### 18 







the Lord grant to him that he may find mercy from the Lord on [^c]that [great] day. You know very well how many things he did for me _and_ what a help he was at Ephesus [you know better than I can tell you]. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

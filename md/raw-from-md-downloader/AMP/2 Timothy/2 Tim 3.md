# 2 Timothy 3

***
















###### 1 







But understand this, that in the last days dangerous times [of great stress and trouble] will come [difficult days that will be hard to bear]. 















###### 2 







For people will be lovers of self [narcissistic, self-focused], lovers of money [impelled by greed], boastful, arrogant, revilers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy _and_ profane, 















###### 3 







[and they will be] unloving [devoid of natural human affection, calloused and inhumane], irreconcilable, malicious gossips, devoid of self-control [intemperate, immoral], brutal, haters of good, 















###### 4 







traitors, reckless, conceited, lovers of [sensual] pleasure rather than lovers of God, 















###### 5 







holding to a form of [outward] godliness (religion), although they have denied its power [for their conduct nullifies their claim of faith]. Avoid such people _and_ keep far away from them. 















###### 6 







For among them are those who worm their way into homes and captivate _morally_ weak _and_ spiritually-dwarfed women weighed down by [the burden of their] sins, easily swayed by various impulses, 















###### 7 







always learning _and_ listening to anybody who will teach them, but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. 















###### 8 







Just as Jannes and Jambres [the court magicians of Egypt] opposed Moses, so these _men_ also oppose the truth, men of depraved mind, unqualified _and_ worthless [as teachers] in regard to the faith. 















###### 9 







But they will not get very far, for their meaningless nonsense _and_ ignorance will become obvious to everyone, as was that of Jannes and Jambres. 















###### 10 







Now you have diligently followed [my example, that is] my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, steadfastness, 















###### 11 







persecutions, and sufferings--such as happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, and at Lystra; what persecutions I endured, but the Lord rescued me from them all! 















###### 12 







Indeed, all who delight in pursuing righteousness _and_ are determined to live godly lives in Christ Jesus will be hunted _and_ persecuted [because of their faith]. 















###### 13 







But evil men and impostors will go on from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived. 















###### 14 







But as for you, continue in the things that you have learned and of which you are convinced [holding tightly to the truths], knowing from whom you learned _them_, 















###### 15 







and how from childhood you have known the sacred writings (Hebrew Scriptures) which are able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus [surrendering your entire self to Him and having absolute confidence in His wisdom, power and goodness]. 















###### 16 







All Scripture is God-breathed [given by divine inspiration] and is profitable for instruction, for conviction [of sin], for correction [of error and restoration to obedience], for training in righteousness [learning to live in conformity to God's will, both publicly and privately--behaving honorably with personal integrity and moral courage]; 















###### 17 







so that the [^a]man of God may be complete _and_ proficient, outfitted _and_ thoroughly equipped for every good work. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

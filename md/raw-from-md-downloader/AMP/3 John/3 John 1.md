# 3 John 1

***
















###### 1 







The elder [of the church addresses this letter] to the beloved _and_ esteemed Gaius, whom I love in truth. 















###### 2 







Beloved, I pray that in every way you may succeed _and_ prosper and be in good health [physically], just as [I know] your soul prospers [spiritually]. 















###### 3 







For I was greatly pleased when [some of the] brothers came [from time to time] and testified to your [faithfulness to the] truth [of the gospel message], _that is_, how you are walking in truth. 















###### 4 







I have no greater joy than this, to hear that my [spiritual] children are living [their lives] in the truth. 















###### 5 







Beloved, you are acting faithfully in what you are providing for the brothers, and especially _when they are_ strangers; 















###### 6 







and they have testified before the church of your love _and_ friendship. You will do well to [assist them and] send them on their way in a manner worthy of God. 















###### 7 







For these [traveling missionaries] went out for the sake of the Name [of Christ], accepting nothing [in the way of assistance] from the Gentiles. 















###### 8 







So we ought to support such people [welcoming them as guests and providing for them], so that we may be fellow workers for the truth [that is, for the gospel message of salvation]. 















###### 9 







I wrote something to the church; but Diotrephes, who loves to put himself first, does not accept what we say _and_ refuses to recognize my authority. 















###### 10 







For this reason, if I come, I will call attention to what he is doing, unjustly accusing us with wicked words _and_ unjustified charges. And not satisfied with this, he refuses to receive the [missionary] brothers himself, and also forbids those who want to [welcome them] and puts _them_ out of the church. 















###### 11 







Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but [imitate] what is good. The one who practices good [exhibiting godly character, moral courage and personal integrity] is of God; the one who practices [or permits or tolerates] evil has not seen God [he has no personal experience with Him and does not know Him at all]. 















###### 12 







Demetrius has received a _good_ testimony _and_ commendation from everyone--and from the truth [the standard of God's word] itself; and we add our testimony _and_ speak well of him, and you know that our testimony is true. 















###### 13 







I had many things [to say when I began] to write to you, but I prefer not to put it down with pen (reed) and [^a]black (ink); 















###### 14 







but I hope to see you soon, and we will speak [^b]face to face. 















###### 15

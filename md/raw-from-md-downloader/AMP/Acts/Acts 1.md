# Acts 1

***
















###### 1 







The first [^a]account I made, Theophilus, was [a continuous report] about all the things that Jesus began to do and to [^b]teach 















###### 2 







until the day when He ascended _to heaven_, after He had by the Holy Spirit given instruction to the apostles (special messengers) whom He had chosen. 















###### 3 







To these [men] He also showed Himself alive after His suffering [in Gethsemane and on the cross], by [a series of] many infallible proofs _and_ unquestionable demonstrations, appearing to them over _a period of_ forty days and talking to them about the things concerning the kingdom of God. 















###### 4 







While being together _and_ eating with them, He commanded them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait for what the Father had promised, "Of which," _He said_, "you have heard Me speak. 















###### 5 







For John baptized with water, but you will be baptized _and_ empowered _and_ united with the Holy Spirit, not long from now." 















###### 6 







So when they had come together, they asked Him _repeatedly_, "Lord, are You at this time reestablishing the kingdom _and_ restoring it to Israel?" 















###### 7 







He said to them, "It is not for you to know the times or epochs which the Father has fixed by His own authority. 















###### 8 







But you will receive power _and_ ability when the Holy Spirit comes upon you; and you will be My witnesses [to tell people about Me] both in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and Samaria, and even to the ends of the earth." ## The Ascension 















###### 9 







And after He said these things, He was caught up as they looked on, and a cloud took Him up out of their sight. 















###### 10 







While they were looking intently into the sky as He was going, two men in white clothing suddenly stood beside them, 















###### 11 







who said, "Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into the sky? This [same] Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will return in just the same way as you have watched Him go into heaven." ## The Upper Room 















###### 12 







Then the disciples returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet (Olive Grove), which is near Jerusalem, [only] a Sabbath day's journey (less than one mile) away. 















###### 13 







When they had entered _the city_, they went upstairs to the upper room where they were staying [indefinitely]; that is, Peter, and John and [his brother] James, and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew (Nathanael) and Matthew, [^c]James _the son_ of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas (Thaddaeus) the son of James. 















###### 14 







All these with one mind _and_ one purpose were continually devoting themselves to prayer, [waiting together] along with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His brothers. 















###### 15 







Now on one of these days Peter stood up among the brothers and sisters **(**a gathering of about a hundred and twenty believers was there**)** and he said, 















###### 16 







"Brothers and sisters, it was necessary that the Scripture be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit foretold by the lips of David [king of Israel] about Judas [Iscariot], who acted as guide to those who arrested Jesus. 















###### 17 







For he (Judas) was counted among us and received his share [by divine allotment] in this ministry." 















###### 18 







**(**Now Judas Iscariot [^d]acquired a piece of land [indirectly] with the [money paid him as a] reward for his treachery, and falling headlong, his body burst open in the middle and all his intestines poured out. 















###### 19 







All the people in Jerusalem learned about this, so in their own dialect--Aramaic--they called the piece of land Hakeldama, that is, Field of Blood.**)** 















###### 20 







"For in the book of Psalms it is written, 'Let his place of residence become desolate, And let there be no one to live in it'; and [again], 'Let another take his position as overseer.' 















###### 21 







So of the men who have accompanied us during all the time that the Lord Jesus spent with us, 















###### 22 







beginning with the baptism by John [at the outset of Jesus' ministry] until the day when He was taken up from us--one of these men _must_ become a witness with us [to testify] of His resurrection." 















###### 23 







And they put forward two men, Joseph, the one called Barsabbas **(**who was surnamed Justus**)**, and Matthias. 















###### 24 







They prayed and said, "You, Lord, who know all hearts [their thoughts, motives, desires], show us which one of these two You have chosen 















###### 25 







to occupy this ministry and apostleship which Judas left to go to his own place [of evil]." 















###### 26 







And they [^e]cast lots for them, and the lot fell to Matthias; and he was added to the eleven apostles. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: Acts 1:1 As the gospel tells us what Jesus began to do and teach, so Acts tells what He continued to do and teach by His Holy Spirit (F. F. Bruce). [^c]: Acts 1:13 Also known as James the Less or James the Younger. His mother, Mary (Gr _Maria_), may have been either a sister or sister-in-law of Mary (Gr _Mariam_), the mother of Jesus. [^d]: Acts 1:18 Peter means that the chief priests purchased the field in Judasâ€™ name. He had returned to them with the money, and when they refused to accept it, he threw it into the temple sanctuary (Matt 27:3 ff). Afterwards they decided to buy the field for use as a burial ground for strangers. Peter goes on to say that Judas was disemboweled in a fall, while Matthew reports that Judas hanged himself (Matt 27:5). One explanation for the apparent discrepancy is that the rope or line that Judas was using broke, and the body fell in such a way as to be disemboweled (Matt 27:3 ff). [^e]: Acts 1:26 The custom of the Jews was to write the names on stones, place them in a container and shake it until one stone fell out.

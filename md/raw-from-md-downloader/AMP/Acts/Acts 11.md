# Acts 11

***
















###### 1 







Now the apostles and the believers who were throughout Judea heard [with astonishment] that the Gentiles also had received _and_ accepted the word of God [the message concerning salvation through Christ]. 















###### 2 







So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, those of the circumcision [certain Jewish believers who followed the Law] took issue with him [for violating Jewish customs], 















###### 3 







saying, "You went to uncircumcised men and [even] ate with them!" 















###### 4 







But Peter began [at the beginning] and explained [the events] to them step by step, saying, 















###### 5 







"I was in the city of Joppa praying; and in a trance I saw a vision of an object coming down from heaven, like a huge sheet being lowered by the four corners; and [it descended until] it came right down to me, 















###### 6 







and looking closely at it, I saw _all kinds of_ the four-footed animals of the earth and the wild beasts and the crawling creatures and the birds of the air [both clean and unclean according to the Law], 















###### 7 







and I also heard a voice saying to me, 'Get up, Peter; kill and eat.' 















###### 8 







But I said, 'Not at all, Lord; for nothing common (unholy) or [ceremonially] unclean has ever entered my mouth.' 















###### 9 







But the voice from heaven answered a second time, 'What God has cleansed _and_ pronounced clean, no longer consider common (unholy).' 















###### 10 







This happened three times, and everything was drawn up again into heaven. 















###### 11 







And right then the three men who had been sent to me from Caesarea arrived at the house where we were _staying_. 















###### 12 







The Spirit told me to go with them without the slightest hesitation. So these six brothers also went with me and we went to the man's house. 















###### 13 







And Cornelius told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house, saying, 'Send _word_ to Joppa and have Simon, who is also called Peter, brought here; 















###### 14 







he will bring a message to you by which you will be saved [and granted eternal life], you and all your household.' 















###### 15 







When I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them just as _He did_ on us at the beginning [at Pentecost]. 















###### 16 







Then I remembered the word of the Lord, how He used to say, 'John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.' 















###### 17 







So, if God gave Gentiles the same gift [equally] as He gave us after we accepted _and_ believed _and_ trusted in the Lord Jesus Christ [as Savior], who was I to interfere _or_ stand in God's way?" 















###### 18 







When they heard this, they quieted down and glorified _and_ praised God, saying, "Then God has also granted to the Gentiles repentance _that leads_ to _eternal_ life [that is, real life after earthly death]." ## The Church at Antioch 















###### 19 







So then [since they were unaware of these developments] those who were scattered because of the persecution that occurred in connection with [the stoning of] Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, without telling the message [of salvation through Christ] to anyone except Jews. 















###### 20 







But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who came to Antioch and _began_ speaking to the Greeks as well, proclaiming [to them] the good news about the Lord Jesus. 















###### 21 







And the hand (the power and presence) of the Lord was with them, and a great number who believed turned to the Lord [for salvation, accepting and drawing near to Jesus as Messiah and Savior]. 















###### 22 







The news of this reached the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch. 















###### 23 







When he arrived and saw the grace of God [that was bestowed on them], he rejoiced and _began_ to encourage them all with an unwavering heart to stay true _and_ devoted to the Lord. 















###### 24 







For Barnabas was a good man [privately and publicly--his godly character benefited both himself and others] and _he was_ full of the Holy Spirit and full of faith [in Jesus the Messiah, through whom believers have everlasting life]. And a great number of people were brought to the Lord. 















###### 25 







And Barnabas left for Tarsus to search for Saul; 















###### 26 







and when he found him, he brought him back to Antioch. For an entire year they met [with others] in the church and instructed large numbers; and it was in Antioch that the disciples were first called Christians. 















###### 27 







Now at this time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. 















###### 28 







One of them named Agabus stood up and prophesied through the [Holy] Spirit that a severe famine would come on the [^a]entire world. And this did happen during the reign of [^b]Claudius. 















###### 29 







So the disciples decided to send _a contribution_, each according to his individual ability, to the believers who lived in Judea. 















###### 30 







And this they did, sending the contribution to the elders by Barnabas and Saul. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

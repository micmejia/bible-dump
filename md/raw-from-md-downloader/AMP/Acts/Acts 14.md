# Acts 14

***
















###### 1 







Now in Iconium Paul and Barnabas went into the Jewish synagogue together and spoke in such a way [with such power and boldness] that a large number of Jews as well as Greeks believed [and confidently accepted Jesus as Savior]; 















###### 2 







but the unbelieving Jews [who rejected Jesus as Messiah] stirred up and embittered the minds of the Gentiles against the [^a]believers. 















###### 3 







So Paul and Barnabas stayed for a long time, speaking boldly _and_ confidently for the Lord, who continued to testify to the word of His grace, granting that signs and wonders (attesting miracles) be done by them. 















###### 4 







But the people of the city were divided; some were _siding_ with the Jews, and some with the apostles. 















###### 5 







When there was an attempt by both the Gentiles and the Jews, together with their rulers, to shamefully mistreat and to stone them, 















###### 6 







they, aware of the situation, escaped to Lystra and Derbe, [taking refuge in the] cities of Lycaonia, and the neighboring region; 















###### 7 







and there they continued to preach the good news. 















###### 8 







Now at Lystra a man sat who was unable to use his feet, for he was crippled from birth and had never walked. 















###### 9 







This man was listening to Paul as he spoke, and Paul looked intently at him and saw that he had faith to be healed, 















###### 10 







and said with a loud voice, "Stand up on your feet." And he jumped up and _began_ to walk. 















###### 11 







And the crowds, when they saw what Paul had done, raised their voices, shouting in the [^b]Lycaonian language, "The gods have come down to us [^c]in human form!" 















###### 12 







They began calling Barnabas, Zeus [chief of the Greek gods], and Paul, Hermes [messenger of the Greek gods], since he took the lead in speaking. 















###### 13 







The priest of Zeus, whose _temple_ was at the entrance of the city, brought bulls and garlands to the city gates, and wanted to offer sacrifices with the crowds. 















###### 14 







But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard about it, they [^d]tore their robes and rushed out into the crowd, shouting, 















###### 15 







"Men, why are you doing these things? We too are only men of the same nature as you, bringing the good news to you, so that you turn from these useless _and_ meaningless things to the living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything that is in them. 















###### 16 







In generations past He permitted all the nations to go their own ways; 















###### 17 







yet He did not leave Himself without some witness [as evidence of Himself], in that He kept constantly doing good things _and_ showing you kindness, and giving you rains from heaven and productive seasons, filling your hearts with food and happiness." 















###### 18 







Even saying these words, with difficulty they prevented the people from offering sacrifices to them. 















###### 19 







But Jews arrived from Antioch and Iconium, and having won over the crowds, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, thinking he was dead. 















###### 20 







But the disciples formed a circle around him, and he got up and went back into the city; and the next day he went on with Barnabas to Derbe. 















###### 21 







They preached the good news to that city and made many disciples, then they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch, 















###### 22 







strengthening _and_ establishing the hearts of the disciples; encouraging them to remain firm in the faith, saying, "It is through many tribulations _and_ hardships that we must enter the kingdom of God." 















###### 23 







When they had appointed elders for them in every church, having prayed with fasting, they entrusted them to the Lord in whom they believed [and joyfully accepted as the Messiah]. 















###### 24 







Then they passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia. 















###### 25 







When they had spoken the word [of salvation through faith in Christ] in Perga, they went down to Attalia. 















###### 26 







From there they sailed back to [^e]Antioch, where they had been entrusted to the grace of God for the [^f]work which they had now completed. 















###### 27 







Arriving _there_, they gathered the church together and _began_ to report [in great detail] everything that God had done with them and how He had opened to the Gentiles a door of faith [in Jesus as the Messiah and Savior]. 















###### 28 







And they stayed there a long time with the disciples. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

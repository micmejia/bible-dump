# Acts 2

***
















###### 1 







When the day of [^a]Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place, 















###### 2 







and suddenly a sound came from heaven like a rushing violent wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. 















###### 3 







There appeared to them tongues resembling fire, which were being distributed [among them], and they rested on each one of them [as each person received the Holy Spirit]. 















###### 4 







And they were all filled [that is, diffused throughout their being] with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other [^b]tongues (different languages), as the Spirit was giving them the ability to speak out [clearly and appropriately]. 















###### 5 







Now there were Jews living in Jerusalem, devout _and_ God-fearing men from every nation under heaven. 















###### 6 







And when this sound was heard, a crowd gathered, and they were bewildered because each one was hearing those in the upper room speaking in his own language _or_ dialect. 















###### 7 







They were completely astonished, saying, "Look! Are not all of these who are speaking Galileans? 















###### 8 







Then how is it that each of us hears in our own language _or_ native dialect? 















###### 9 







[Among us there are] Parthians, Medes and Elamites, and people of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and [^c]Asia [Minor], 















###### 10 







Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the districts of Libya around Cyrene, and the visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes (Gentile converts to Judaism), 















###### 11 







Cretans and Arabs--we all hear them speaking in our [native] tongues about the mighty works of God!" 















###### 12 







And they were beside themselves with amazement and were greatly perplexed, saying one to another, "What could this mean?" 















###### 13 







But others were laughing _and_ joking _and_ ridiculing them, saying, "They are full of sweet wine _and_ are drunk!" ## Peter's Sermon 















###### 14 







But Peter, standing with the eleven, raised his voice and addressed them: "Men of Judea and all you who live in Jerusalem, let this be explained to you; listen closely _and_ pay attention to what I have to say. 















###### 15 







These people are not drunk, as you assume, since it is [only] the third hour of the day (9:00 a.m.); 















###### 16 







but this is [the beginning of] what was spoken of through the prophet Joel: 















###### 17 







'And it shall be in the last days,' says God, 'That I will pour out My Spirit upon all mankind; And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, And your young men shall see [divinely prompted] visions, And your old men shall dream [divinely prompted] dreams; 















###### 18 







Even on My bond-servants, both men and women, I will in those days pour out My Spirit And they shall prophesy. 















###### 19 







'And I will bring about wonders in the sky above And signs (attesting miracles) on the earth below, Blood and fire and smoking vapor. 















###### 20 







'The sun shall be turned into darkness And the moon into blood, Before the great and glorious day of the Lord comes. 















###### 21 







'And it shall be that everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord [invoking, adoring, and worshiping the Lord Jesus] shall be saved (rescued spiritually).' 















###### 22 







"Men of Israel, listen to these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a Man accredited _and_ pointed out _and_ attested to you by God with [the power to perform] miracles and wonders and signs which God worked through Him in your [very] midst, just as you yourselves know-- 















###### 23 







this _Man_, when handed over [to the Roman authorities] according to the predetermined decision and foreknowledge of God, you nailed to a cross and put to death by the hands of lawless _and_ godless men. 















###### 24 







But God raised Him up, releasing Him _and_ bringing an end to the agony of death, since it was impossible for Him to be held in death's power. 















###### 25 







For David says of Him, 'I saw the Lord constantly before me; For He is at my right hand, so that I will not be shaken [from my state of security]. 















###### 26 







'Therefore my heart rejoiced and my tongue exulted exceedingly; Moreover my flesh also will live in hope [that is, will encamp in anticipation of the resurrection]; 















###### 27 







'For You will not forsake me _and_ abandon my soul to Hades (the realm of the dead), Nor let Your Holy One undergo decay [after death]. 















###### 28 







'You have made known to me the ways of life; You will fill me [infusing my soul] with joy with Your presence.' 















###### 29 







"Brothers, I may confidently _and_ freely say to you regarding the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. 















###### 30 







And so, being a prophet and knowing fully that God had sworn to him with an oath that He would seat _one_ of his descendants on his throne, 















###### 31 







he foresaw and spoke [prophetically] of the resurrection of the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed), that He was not abandoned [in death] to Hades (the realm of the dead), nor did His body undergo decay. 















###### 32 







God raised this Jesus [bodily from the dead], and of that [fact] we are all witnesses. 















###### 33 







Therefore having been exalted [^d]to the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, He has poured out this [blessing] which you both see and hear. 















###### 34 







For David did not ascend into the heavens, yet he himself says, 'The Lord [the Father] said to my [^e]LORD [the Son], "Sit at My right hand, 















###### 35 







Until I make Your enemies a [^f]footstool for Your feet."' 















###### 36 







Therefore let all the house of Israel recognize beyond all doubt that God has made Him both Lord and Christ (Messiah, Anointed)--this Jesus whom you crucified." ## The Ingathering 















###### 37 







Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart [with remorse and anxiety], and they said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, "Brothers, what are we to do?" 















###### 38 







And Peter said to them, "Repent [change your old way of thinking, turn from your sinful ways, accept and follow Jesus as the Messiah] and be baptized, each of you, in the name of Jesus Christ because of the forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. 















###### 39 







For the promise [of the Holy Spirit] is for you and your children and for all who are far away [including the Gentiles], as many as the Lord our God calls to Himself." 















###### 40 







And Peter solemnly testified and continued to admonish _and_ urge them with many more words, saying, "[^g]Be saved from this crooked _and_ unjust generation!" 















###### 41 







So then, those who accepted his message were baptized; and on that day about [^h]3,000 souls were added [to the body of believers]. 















###### 42 







They were continually _and_ faithfully devoting themselves to the instruction of the apostles, and to fellowship, to [^i]eating meals together and to prayers. 















###### 43 







A sense of awe was felt by [^j]everyone, and many wonders and signs (attesting miracles) were taking place through the apostles. 















###### 44 







And all those who had believed [in Jesus as Savior] [^k]were together and had all things in common [considering their possessions to belong to the group as a whole]. 















###### 45 







And they _began_ selling their property and possessions and were sharing the proceeds with all [the other believers], as anyone had need. 















###### 46 







Day after day they met in the temple [area] continuing with one mind, and breaking bread in various private homes. They were eating their meals together with joy and generous hearts, 















###### 47 







praising God _continually_, and having favor with all the people. And the Lord kept adding to their number daily those who were being saved. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Acts 21

***
















###### 1 







When we had torn ourselves away from them and set sail, we ran a straight course and came to Cos, and on the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara; 















###### 2 







and after finding a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, we went on board and set sail. 















###### 3 







After we came in sight of Cyprus, leaving it on our left (port side), we sailed on to Syria and put in at Tyre; for there the ship was to unload her cargo. 















###### 4 







After looking up the disciples [in Tyre], we stayed there [with them] seven days; and they kept telling Paul through the [Holy] Spirit [^a]not to set foot in Jerusalem. 















###### 5 







When our days there came to an end, we left and proceeded on our journey, while all of the disciples, with their wives and children, escorted us on our way until _we were_ outside the city. After kneeling down on the beach and praying, we told one another goodbye. 















###### 6 







Then we boarded the ship, and they returned to their homes. 















###### 7 







When we had completed the voyage from Tyre, we landed [twenty miles to the south] at Ptolemais, and after greeting the [^b]believers, we stayed with them for one day. 















###### 8 







On the next day we left and came to Caesarea, and we went to the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven [deacons], and stayed with him. 















###### 9 







He had four virgin daughters who had the gift of prophecy. 















###### 10 







As we were staying there for some time, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea. 















###### 11 







And coming to [see] us, he took Paul's [wide] [^c]band (belt, sash) and bound his own feet and hands, and said, "This is what the Holy Spirit says: 'In this same way the Jews in Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this band, and they will hand him over to the Gentiles (pagans).'" 















###### 12 







Now when we had heard this, both we and the local residents _began_ pleading with Paul trying to persuade him not to go up to Jerusalem. 















###### 13 







Then Paul replied, "What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart [like this]? For I am ready not only to be bound _and_ imprisoned, but even to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus." 















###### 14 







And since he would not be dissuaded, we stopped pleading _and_ fell silent, saying, "The Lord's will be done!" ## Paul at Jerusalem 















###### 15 







After this we got ready and started on our way up to Jerusalem. 















###### 16 







Some of the disciples from Caesarea also came with us, taking us to [the house of] Mnason, a man from Cyprus, a disciple of long standing with whom we were to lodge. 















###### 17 







When we arrived in Jerusalem, the [^d]brothers and sisters welcomed us gladly. 















###### 18 







On the next day Paul went with us to [see] [^e]James, and all the elders _of the church_ were present. 















###### 19 







After greeting them, Paul _began_ to give a detailed account of the things that God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry. 















###### 20 







And when they heard it, they _began_ glorifying _and_ praising God; and they said to him, "You see, brother, how many thousands of believers there are among the Jews, and they are all enthusiastic supporters of the Law [of Moses]. 















###### 21 







Now they have been told about you, that you are teaching all the Jews who are _living_ among the Gentiles to turn away from [the Law of] Moses, advising them not to circumcise their children or to live according to the [Mosaic] customs. 















###### 22 







What then should be done? They will certainly hear that you have arrived. 















###### 23 







Therefore do just what we tell you. We have four men who have taken a vow; 















###### 24 







take these men and purify yourself along with them, and pay their expenses [for the temple offerings] so that they may shave their heads. Then everyone will know that there is nothing to the things they have been told about you, but that you yourself also follow and keep the Law. 















###### 25 







But with regard to the Gentiles who have believed [in Christ], we have sent them a letter with our decision that they should abstain from meat sacrificed to idols and from [consuming] blood and from [the meat of] what has been strangled and from sexual immorality." 















###### 26 







Then Paul took the [four] men, and the next day he purified himself along with them [by submitting to the ritual]. He went into the temple to give notice of [the time] when the days of purification [ending each vow] would be fulfilled and the usual offering could be presented on behalf of each one. ## Paul Seized in the Temple 















###### 27 







When the seven days [required to complete the ritual] were almost over, [some] Jews from [the province of] Asia [Minor], caught sight of him in the temple, and _began_ to stir up the crowd, and they seized him, 















###### 28 







shouting, "Men of Israel, help us! This is the man who teaches all men everywhere against our people and the Law and this place. And besides, he has brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place." 















###### 29 







For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with Paul, and they assumed that he had brought the man into the temple [beyond the court of the Gentiles]. 















###### 30 







Then the whole city was provoked _and_ confused, and the people rushed together. They seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple, and immediately the gates were closed. 















###### 31 







Now while they were trying to kill him, word came to the commander of the [Roman] garrison that all Jerusalem was in a state of upheaval. 















###### 32 







So he immediately took soldiers and centurions and ran down among them. When the people saw the commander and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul. 















###### 33 







Then the commander came up and arrested Paul, and ordered that he be bound with two chains. Then he asked who he was and what he had done. 















###### 34 







But some in the crowd were shouting one thing and others something else; and since he could not determine the facts because of the uproar, he ordered that Paul be taken to the barracks [in the tower of Antonia]. 















###### 35 







When Paul got to the steps, he was carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the mob; 















###### 36 







for the majority of the people kept following them, shouting, "Away with him! [Kill him!]" 















###### 37 







Just as Paul was about to be taken into the barracks, he asked the commander, "May I say something to you?" And the man replied, "Do you know Greek? 















###### 38 







Then you are not [as I assumed] the Egyptian who [^f]some time ago stirred up a rebellion and led those 4,000 men of the Assassins out into the wilderness?" 















###### 39 







Paul said, "I am a Jew from [^g]Tarsus in Cilicia (Mersin Province, Turkey), a citizen of no insignificant city; and I beg you, allow me to speak to the people." 















###### 40 







When the commander had given him permission, Paul, standing on the steps, gestured with his hand to the people; and when there was a great hush, he spoke to them in the Hebrew dialect (Jewish Aramaic), saying, ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

But a question remains as to whether the Spirit was actually forbidding Paul to go, or only preparing him for what he would have to suffer in Jerusalem (cf v 11). Either explanation is possible, but many Bible scholars prefer the latter. [^b]: Acts 21:7 Lit _brethren_. [^c]: Acts 21:11 This was not a belt like men wear today, but a band (sash, girdle), about six inches wide, usually made of leather, worn on top of the outer garment. It was fastened around the midsection of the body and served as a kind of pocket or pouch to carry personal items such as a dagger, money or other necessary things. [^d]: Acts 21:17 Lit _brethren_. [^e]: Acts 21:18 The half brother of Jesus, author of the _Letter of James_ and leader of the church in Jerusalem, not to be confused with James the Apostle (Johnâ€™s brother). [^f]: Acts 21:38 Lit _before these days_. [^g]: Acts 21:39 A major city located at the crossing of several ancient trade routes, Tarsus (Tarsos, Tarsisi) was also known for its literary schools which rivaled those located in Athens and Alexandria.

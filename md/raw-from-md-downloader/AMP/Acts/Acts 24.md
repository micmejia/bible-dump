# Acts 24

***
















###### 1 







Five days later, the high priest Ananias came down [from Jerusalem to Caesarea] with some elders and an attorney _named_ Tertullus [acting as spokesman and counsel]. They presented to the governor their [formal] charges against Paul. 















###### 2 







After Paul had been summoned, Tertullus began the complaint [against him], saying _to the governor_: "Since through you we have attained great peace, and since by your foresight reforms are being carried out for this nation, 















###### 3 







in every way and in every place, most excellent Felix, we acknowledge this with all gratitude. 















###### 4 







But so that I do not weary you further, I beg you to grant us, by your kindness, a brief hearing. 















###### 5 







For we have found this man to be a public menace and one who [^a]instigates dissension among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the [heretical] [^b]sect of the Nazarenes. 















###### 6 







He even tried to desecrate the temple, but we took him into custody [^c][and we intended to judge him by our Law, 















###### 7 







but Lysias the commander came, and with great force took him out of our hands, 















###### 8 







and ordered his accusers to come before you.] By interrogating him yourself concerning all these matters you will be able to determine [the truth about] these things with which we charge him." 















###### 9 







The Jews also joined in the attack, declaring _and_ insisting that these things were so. 















###### 10 







When the governor nodded for him to speak, Paul answered, "Knowing that for many years you have been a judge over this nation, I make my defense cheerfully _and_ with good courage. 















###### 11 







As you can easily verify, it has been no more than twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship. 















###### 12 







Neither in the temple, nor in the synagogues, nor _elsewhere_ in the city did they find me carrying on a discussion _or_ disputing with anybody or causing a crowd to gather. 















###### 13 







Nor can they present evidence to you to prove what they now bring against me. 















###### 14 







But I confess this to you, that according to [^d]the Way, which they call a [divisive and heretical] sect, I do worship _and_ serve the God of our fathers, [confidently] believing everything that is in accordance with the Law [of Moses] and that is written in the Prophets; 















###### 15 







having [the same] hope in God which these men cherish themselves, that there shall certainly be a resurrection of [the dead], both of the righteous and of the wicked. 















###### 16 







In view of this, I also do my best _and_ strive always to have a clear conscience before God and before men. 















###### 17 







Now after several years I came [to Jerusalem] to bring to my people charitable contributions and offerings. 















###### 18 







They found me in the temple presenting these _offerings_, after I had undergone [the rites of] purification, without any crowd or uproar. But _there were_ some Jews from [the west coast province of] Asia [Minor], 















###### 19 







who ought to have been here before you to present their charges, if they have anything against me. 















###### 20 







Or else let these men tell what crime they found [me guilty of] when I stood before the Council (Sanhedrin, Jewish High Court), 















###### 21 







other than for this one statement which I had shouted out as I stood among them, 'For the resurrection of the dead I am on trial before you today.'" 















###### 22 







But Felix, having a rather accurate understanding about the Way, put them off, saying, "When Lysias the commander comes down, I will decide your case." 















###### 23 







Then he ordered the centurion to keep Paul in custody, but to let him have some freedom, and [he told the centurion] not to stop any of his friends from providing for his needs. 















###### 24 







Several days later Felix came with his wife [^e]Drusilla, who was a Jewess. He sent for Paul and listened to him talk about faith in Christ Jesus. 















###### 25 







But as he was discussing righteousness, self-control [honorable behavior, personal integrity], and the judgment to come, Felix became frightened and said, "Go away for now, and when I find [a convenient] time I will send for you." 















###### 26 







At the same time he was also hoping to get money from Paul [as a bribe]; so he continued to send for him quite often and talked with him. 















###### 27 







But after two years had passed, Felix was succeeded [in office] by [^f]Porcius Festus; and wishing to do the Jews a favor, Felix left Paul imprisoned. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

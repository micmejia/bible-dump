# Acts 28

***
















###### 1 







After we were safe [on land], we found out that the island was called [^a]Malta. 















###### 2 







And the [^b]natives showed us extraordinary kindness _and_ hospitality; for they kindled a fire and welcomed us all, since it had begun to rain and was cold. 















###### 3 







But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a [^c]viper crawled out because of the heat and fastened itself on his hand. 















###### 4 







When the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand, they _began_ saying to one another, "Undoubtedly this man is a murderer, and though he has been saved from the sea, Justice [the avenging goddess] has not permitted him to live." 















###### 5 







Then Paul [simply] shook the creature off into the fire and suffered no ill effects. 















###### 6 







But they stood watching _and_ expecting him to swell up or suddenly drop dead. But after they had waited a long time and had seen nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and _began_ saying that he was a god. 















###### 7 







In the vicinity of that place there were estates belonging to the leading man of the island, named Publius, who welcomed and entertained us hospitably for three days. 















###### 8 







And it happened that the father of Publius was sick [in bed] with recurring attacks of fever and dysentery; and Paul went to him, and after he had prayed, he laid his hands on him and healed him. 















###### 9 







After this occurred, the rest of the people on the island who had diseases were coming to him and being healed. 















###### 10 







They also gave us many honors [gifts and courtesies expressing respect]; and when we were setting sail, they supplied us with all the things we needed. ## Paul Arrives at Rome 















###### 11 







At the end of three months we set sail on a ship which had wintered at the island, an Alexandrian ship with the [^d]Twin Brothers [Castor and Pollux] as its figurehead. 















###### 12 







We landed at Syracuse [on Sicily] and stayed there three days. 















###### 13 







From there we sailed around and arrived at Rhegium [on Italy's southern tip]; and a day later a south wind came up, and on the second day we arrived at [^e]Puteoli. 















###### 14 







There we found some believers and were invited to stay with them for seven days. And so we came to Rome. 















###### 15 







And the brothers and sisters, having heard news about us, came from as far away as the [^f]Forum of Appius and [^g]Three Inns to meet us. When Paul saw them, he thanked God and was encouraged. 















###### 16 







When we entered Rome, Paul was allowed to stay by himself [in rented quarters] with the soldier who was guarding him. 















###### 17 







Three days later he called together the leaders of the Jews; and when they had gathered, he said to them, "Kinsmen, though I have done nothing against our people or against the customs of our fathers, yet I was turned over as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans. 















###### 18 







After they had interrogated me, they were ready to release me because I was not guilty of any offense deserving death. 















###### 19 







But when the Jews objected [to my release], I was forced to appeal to Caesar (Emperor Nero), not because I had any charge to make against my nation. 















###### 20 







For this reason I have asked to see you and talk with you, since it is for the sake of the hope of Israel (the Messiah, the resurrection) that I am bound with this chain." 















###### 21 







They said to him, "We have not received [any] letters about you from Judea, nor have any of the [Jewish] brothers come here and reported or said anything bad about you. 















###### 22 







But we would like to hear from you what your views are [that is, exactly what you believe]; for in regard to this sect (Christianity), we are fully aware that it is denounced everywhere." 















###### 23 







When they had set a day for Paul, they came to his lodging in large numbers. And he carefully explained [Christianity] to them from morning until evening, solemnly testifying about the kingdom of God and trying to persuade them concerning Jesus, both from the Law of Moses and from the [writings of the] Prophets. 















###### 24 







Some were persuaded by what he said, but others would not believe. 















###### 25 







They disagreed among themselves and they _began_ to leave after Paul had made one _last_ statement: "The Holy Spirit rightly spoke through Isaiah the prophet to your fathers, saying, 















###### 26 







'Go to this people and say, "You will keep on hearing, but will not understand, You will keep on seeing, but will not perceive; 















###### 27 







"For the heart (the understanding, the soul) of this people has become dull (calloused), And with their ears they scarcely hear, And they have shut their eyes [to the truth]; Otherwise they might see with their eyes, And hear with their ears, And understand with their heart and return [to Me], And I would heal them."' 















###### 28 







Therefore let it be known to you that [this message of] the salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles; they indeed will listen!" 















###### 29 







[^h][And when he had said these things, the Jews left, arguing among themselves.] 















###### 30 







And Paul lived there for two full years [at his own expense] in his own rented lodging and welcomed all who came to him,

# Acts 9

***
















###### 1 







Now [^a]Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord [and relentless in his search for believers], went to the [^b]high priest, 















###### 2 







and he asked for letters [of authority] from him to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any men or women there belonging to [^c]the Way [believers, followers of Jesus the Messiah], men and women alike, he could arrest them _and_ bring them bound [with chains] to Jerusalem. 















###### 3 







As he traveled he approached Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him [displaying the glory and majesty of Christ]; 















###### 4 







and he fell to the ground and heard a voice [from heaven] saying to him, "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting _and_ oppressing Me?" 















###### 5 







And Saul said, "Who are You, Lord?" And He _answered_, "I am Jesus whom you are persecuting, 















###### 6 







now get up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do." 















###### 7 







The men who were traveling with him [were terrified and] stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one. 















###### 8 







Saul got up from the ground, but though his eyes were open, he could see nothing; so they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus. 















###### 9 







And he was unable to see for three days, and he neither ate nor drank. 















###### 10 







Now in Damascus there was a disciple named Ananias; and the Lord said to him in a vision, "Ananias." And he answered, "Here I am, Lord." 















###### 11 







And the Lord said to him, "Get up and go to the street called [^d]Straight, and ask at the house of Judas for a man from Tarsus named Saul; for he is praying [there], 















###### 12 







and in a vision he has seen a man named Ananias come in and place his hands on him, so that he may regain his sight." 















###### 13 







But Ananias answered, "Lord, I have heard from many people about this man, especially how much suffering _and_ evil he has brought on Your saints (God's people) at Jerusalem; 















###### 14 







and here [in Damascus] he has authority from the high priests to put in chains all who call on Your name [confessing You as Savior]." 















###### 15 







But the Lord said to him, "Go, for this man is a [deliberately] chosen instrument of Mine, to bear My name before the Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel; 















###### 16 







for I will make clear to him how much he must suffer _and_ endure for My name's sake." 















###### 17 







So Ananias left and entered the house, and he laid his hands on Saul and said, "Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you came [to Damascus], has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit [in order to proclaim Christ to both Jews and Gentiles]." 















###### 18 







Immediately something like scales fell from Saul's eyes, and he regained his sight. Then he got up and was baptized; 















###### 19 







and he took some food and was strengthened. ## Saul Begins to Preach Christ For several days [afterward] Saul remained with the disciples who were at Damascus. 















###### 20 







And immediately he _began_ proclaiming Jesus in the synagogues, saying, "This Man is the Son of God [the promised Messiah]!" 















###### 21 







All those who heard him continued to be amazed and said, "Is this not the man who in Jerusalem attacked those who called on this name [of Jesus], and had come here [to Damascus] for the express purpose of bringing them bound [with chains] before the chief priests?" 















###### 22 







But Saul increased in strength more and more, and continued to perplex the Jews who lived in Damascus by examining [theological evidence] _and_ proving [with Scripture] that this _Jesus_ is the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed). 















###### 23 







After considerable time had passed [about three years or so], the Jews plotted together to kill him, 















###### 24 







but their plot became known to Saul. They were also watching the city's gates day and night so they could kill him; 















###### 25 







but his disciples took him at night and let him down through _an opening in_ the wall, lowering him in a large basket. 















###### 26 







When he arrived in Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he really was a disciple. 















###### 27 







However, [^e]Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles, and described to them how Saul had seen the Lord on the road [to Damascus], and how He had spoken to him, and how at Damascus Saul had preached openly _and_ spoken confidently in the name of Jesus. 















###### 28 







So he was with them, moving around freely [as one among them] in Jerusalem, speaking out boldly in the name of the Lord. 















###### 29 







He was talking and arguing with the [^f]Hellenists (Greek-speaking Jews); but they were attempting to kill him. 















###### 30 







When the brothers found out [about the plot], they brought him down to [^g]Caesarea [Maritima] and sent him off to Tarsus [his home town]. 















###### 31 







So the church throughout Judea and Galilee and Samaria enjoyed peace [without persecution], being built up [in wisdom, virtue, and faith]; and walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort _and_ encouragement of the Holy Spirit, it continued to grow [in numbers]. ## Peter's Ministry 















###### 32 







Now as Peter was traveling throughout _the land_, he went down to [visit] the [^h]saints (God's people) who lived at Lydda. 















###### 33 







There he found a man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years and was paralyzed. 















###### 34 







Peter said to him, "Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you. Get up and make your bed." Immediately Aeneas got up. 















###### 35 







Then all who lived at Lydda and _the plain of_ Sharon saw [what had happened to] him, and they turned to the Lord. 















###### 36 







Now in [^i]Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha, **(**which translated _into Greek_ means Dorcas**)**. She was rich in acts of kindness and charity which she continually did. 















###### 37 







During that time it happened that she became sick and died; and when they had washed her body, they laid it in an upstairs room. 















###### 38 







Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men to him, urging him, "Come to us without delay." 















###### 39 







So Peter got up [at once] and went with them. When he arrived, they brought him into the upstairs room; and all the widows stood beside him, weeping and showing [him] all the [^j]tunics and robes that Dorcas used to make while she was with them. 















###### 40 







But Peter sent them all out [of the room] and knelt down and prayed; then turning to the body he said, "Tabitha, arise!" And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up. 















###### 41 







And he gave her his hand and helped her up; and then he called in the [^k]saints (God's people) and the widows, and he presented her [to them] alive. 















###### 42 







This became known all over Joppa, and many came to believe in the Lord [that is, to adhere to and trust in and rely on Jesus as Christ and Savior]. 















###### 43 







And so it was that Peter stayed in Joppa for many days with Simon, [^l]a tanner. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

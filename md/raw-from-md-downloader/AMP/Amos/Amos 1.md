# Amos 1

***
















###### 1 







The words of Amos, who was among the sheepherders of [^a]Tekoa, which he saw [in a divine revelation] concerning [^b]Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel, two years before the earthquake. 















###### 2 







And he said, "The LORD thunders _and_ roars from Zion [in judgment] And utters His voice from Jerusalem; Then the pastures of the shepherds mourn, And the summit of [Mount] Carmel dries up [because of God's judgment]." 















###### 3 







Thus says the LORD, "For three transgressions of Damascus and for four (multiplied delinquencies) I shall not reverse its punishment _or_ revoke My word concerning it, Because they have threshed Gilead [east of the Jordan River] with sharp iron sledges [having spikes that crushed and shredded]. 















###### 4 







"So I will send a fire [of war, conquest, and destruction] upon the house of [^c]Hazael, And it shall devour the palaces _and_ strongholds of [^d]Ben-hadad (Hazael's son). 















###### 5 







"I also will break the bar [of the gate] of Damascus, And cut off _and_ destroy the inhabitant from the Valley of Aven (Wickedness), And the ruler who holds the scepter, from Beth-eden (Damascus); And the people of Aram [conquered by the Assyrians] will go into exile to [^e]Kir," Says the LORD. 















###### 6 







Thus says the LORD, "For three transgressions of Gaza [in Philistia] and for four (multiplied delinquencies) I will not reverse its punishment _or_ revoke My word concerning it, Because [as slave traders] they took captive the entire [Jewish] population [of defenseless Judean border villages, of which none was spared] And deported them to Edom [for the slave trade]. 















###### 7 







"So I will send a fire [of war, conquest, and destruction] on the wall of Gaza And it shall consume her citadels. 















###### 8 







"And I will cut off _and_ destroy the inhabitants from Ashdod, And the ruler who holds the scepter, from Ashkelon; And I will unleash My power _and_ turn My hand [in judgment] against Ekron, And the rest of the Philistines [in Gath and the towns dependent on these four Philistine cities] shall die," Says the Lord God. 















###### 9 







Thus says the LORD, "For three transgressions of Tyre and for four (multiplied delinquencies) I will not reverse its punishment _or_ revoke My word concerning it, Because they [as middlemen] deported an entire [Jewish] population to Edom And did not [seriously] remember their covenant of brotherhood. 















###### 10 







"So I will send a fire [of war, conquest, and destruction] on the wall of Tyre, And it shall consume her citadels." 















###### 11 







Thus says the LORD, "For three transgressions of Edom [the descendants of Esau] and for four (multiplied delinquencies) I will not reverse its punishment _or_ revoke My word concerning it, Because he pursued his brother Jacob (Israel) with the sword, Corrupting _and_ stifling his compassions _and_ casting off all mercy; His destructive anger raged continually, And he maintained [and nurtured] his wrath forever. 















###### 12 







"So I will send a fire [of war, conquest, and destruction] upon Teman, And it shall consume the citadels of Bozrah [in Edom]." 















###### 13 







Thus says the LORD, "For three transgressions of the children of [^f]Ammon and for four (multiplied delinquencies) I will not reverse its punishment _or_ revoke My word concerning it, Because the Ammonites have ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead, That they might enlarge their border. 















###### 14 







"So I will kindle a fire [of war, conquest, and destruction] on the wall of Rabbah [in Ammon] And it shall devour its strongholds Amid war cries _and_ shouts of alarm on the day of battle, And a tempest on the day of the whirlwind [when the enemy captures the city]. 















###### 15 







"Their king shall go into exile, He and his princes together," says the LORD. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

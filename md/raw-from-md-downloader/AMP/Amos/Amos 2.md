# Amos 2

***
















###### 1 







Thus says the LORD, "For three transgressions of [^a]Moab and for four (multiplied delinquencies) I will not reverse its punishment _or_ revoke My word concerning it, Because he burned the bones of the king of Edom [Esau's descendant] into lime [and used it to plaster a Moabite house]. 















###### 2 







"So I will send a fire [of war, conquest, and destruction] upon Moab And it shall devour the strongholds of Kerioth; And Moab shall die amid tumult _and_ uproar, With war cries _and_ shouts of alarm and the sound of the trumpet. 















###### 3 







"I will also cut off _and_ destroy the ruler from its midst And slay all the princes with him," says the LORD. ## Judgment on Judah 















###### 4 







Thus says the LORD, "For three transgressions of Judah and for four (multiplied delinquencies) I will not reverse its punishment _or_ revoke My word concerning it, Because they have rejected the law of the LORD [the sum of God's instruction to His people] And have not kept His commandments; But their lies [and their idols], after which their fathers walked, Caused them to go astray. 















###### 5 







"So I will send a fire [of war, conquest, and destruction by the Babylonians] upon Judah And it will devour the strongholds of Jerusalem." ## Judgment on Israel 















###### 6 







Thus says the LORD, "For three transgressions of Israel and for four (multiplied delinquencies) I will not reverse its punishment _or_ revoke My word concerning it, Because they sell the righteous _and_ innocent for silver And the needy for the price of a pair of sandals. 















###### 7 







"These who pant after (long to see) the dust of the earth on the head of the helpless [as sign of their grief and distress] Also turn aside the way of the humble; And a man and his father will go to the same [^b]girl So that My holy name is profaned. 















###### 8 







"They stretch out beside every [pagan] altar on clothes taken in pledge [to secure a loan, disregarding God's command], And in the house of their God [in contempt of Him] they frivolously drink the wine [which has been] taken from those who have been fined. 















###### 9 







"Yet it was I [not the false gods] who destroyed the Amorite before them, Though his height was like the height of the cedars, And he was as strong as the oaks; I even destroyed his fruit above and his root below. 















###### 10 







"Also it was I who brought you up out of the land of Egypt, And I led you forty years through the wilderness That you might possess the land of the Amorite. 















###### 11 







"Then I raised up some of your sons to be prophets [who gave you My revelation], And some of your young men to be Nazirites (dedicated ones). Is this not true, O you children of Israel?" says the LORD. 















###### 12 







"But you gave the Nazirites wine to drink [despite their vows] And commanded the prophets, saying, 'You shall not prophesy!' 















###### 13 







"Behold, I am weighted down beneath you As a cart that is weighted down when it is full of sheaves. 















###### 14 







"Flight will be lost to the swift [so they will be unable to escape], And the strong shall not strengthen _nor_ maintain his power, Nor shall the mighty man save his own life. 















###### 15 







"He who handles the bow will not stand _his ground_, The one who is swift of foot will not escape, Nor will he who rides the horse save his life [from the invading army]. 















###### 16 







"Even the bravest among the warriors shall flee naked on that day," says the LORD. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

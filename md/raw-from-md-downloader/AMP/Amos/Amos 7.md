# Amos 7

***
















###### 1 







Thus the Lord God showed me [a vision], and behold, He was forming a swarm of locusts when the spring crop began to sprout. And behold, the spring crop was after the king's mowing. 















###### 2 







And when the locusts had finished eating the plants of the land, then I said, "O Lord God, please forgive! How can Jacob stand, For he is so small [that he cannot endure this]?" 















###### 3 







The LORD revoked this sentence. "It shall not take place," said the LORD. 















###### 4 







Thus the Lord God showed me, and behold, the Lord God called for punishment with fire, and it devoured the great deep [underground sources of water] and began to consume the land. 















###### 5 







Then I said, "O Lord God, please stop! How can Jacob stand, For he is so small [that he cannot endure this]?" 















###### 6 







The LORD revoked this sentence. "This also shall not be," said the Lord God. 















###### 7 







Thus He showed me [a vision], and behold, the Lord was standing by a vertical wall with a plumb line in His hand [to determine if the wall was straight or if it needed to be destroyed]. 















###### 8 







The LORD said to me, "Amos, what do you see?" And I said, "A plumb line." Then the Lord said, "Behold, I am setting a plumb line [as a standard] Among My people Israel [showing the defectiveness of the nation, requiring judgment]. I shall not spare them any longer. [The door of mercy is shut.] 















###### 9 







"And the [idolatrous] high places of Isaac (Israel) will be devastated _and_ deserted, And the sanctuaries of Israel will be in ruins. Then I shall rise up against the house of Jeroboam with the sword [and destroy the monarchy]." ## Amos Accused, Answers 















###### 10 







Then Amaziah, the priest of Bethel [site of the golden calf shrine], sent _word_ to [^a]Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, "Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel; the land is unable to endure all his words. 















###### 11 







For in this way Amos has said, 'Jeroboam will die by the sword and Israel will certainly go from its land into exile.'" 















###### 12 







Then Amaziah said to Amos, "Go, you seer, run for your life [from Israel] to the land of Judah [your own country] and eat bread and live as a prophet there! 















###### 13 







But do not prophesy any longer at Bethel, for it is the king's sanctuary and a royal residence." 















###### 14 







Then Amos replied to Amaziah, "I am not a prophet [by profession], nor am I a prophet's son; I am a herdsman and a grower of sycamore figs. 















###### 15 







But the LORD took me as I followed the flock and the LORD said to me, 'Go, prophesy to My people Israel.' 















###### 16 







Now therefore, listen to the word of the LORD: You say, 'You shall not prophesy against Israel nor shall you speak against the house of Isaac.' 















###### 17 







Therefore, thus says the LORD, 'Your wife shall become a prostitute in the city [when the [^b]Assyrians capture Samaria] and your sons and your daughters shall fall by the sword, and your land shall be divided by a measuring line; you yourself shall die in an unclean _and_ defiled [pagan] land, and Israel shall certainly go from its land into exile.'" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Amos 8

***
















###### 1 







Thus the Lord God showed me [a vision], and behold, _there was_ a basket of [overripe] summer fruit. 















###### 2 







And He said, "Amos, what do you see?" And I said, "A basket of summer fruit." Then the LORD said to me, "The end has come for My people Israel. I will spare them no longer [for the nation is ripe for judgment]. 















###### 3 







In that day, the songs of the palace shall turn to wailing," says the Lord God. "There will be many dead bodies; in [sacred] silence they will throw them everywhere." 















###### 4 







Hear this, you who trample down the needy, and do away with the poor of the land, 















###### 5 







saying, "When will the New Moon [festival] be over So that we may sell grain, And the Sabbath ended so that we may open the wheat _market_, Making the ephah [measure] smaller and the shekel bigger [that is, selling less for a higher price] And to cheat by falsifying the scales, 















###### 6 







So that we may buy the poor [as slaves] for silver [since they are unable to support themselves] And the [^a]needy for a pair of sandals, And that we may sell the leftovers of the wheat [as if it were a good grade of grain]?" 















###### 7 







The LORD has sworn [an oath] by the pride of Jacob, "Surely I shall never forget [nor leave unpunished] any of their [rebellious] acts. 















###### 8 







"Because of this [coming judgment] will the land not quake And everyone mourn who dwells in it? Indeed, all of it shall rise up like the Nile, And it will be tossed around [from the impact of judgment] And [afterward] subside again like the Nile of Egypt. 















###### 9 







"It shall come about in that day," says the Lord God, "That I shall cause the sun to go down at noon, And I shall darken the earth in broad daylight. 















###### 10 







"And I shall turn your festivals _and_ feasts into mourning And all your songs into dirges (funeral poems to be sung); And I shall cause sackcloth to be put on everyone's [^b]loins And baldness on every head [shaved for mourning]. And I shall make that time like _a time of_ mourning for an only son [who has died], And the end of it shall be like a bitter day. 















###### 11 







"Behold, the days are coming," says the Lord God, "When I will send hunger over the land, Not hunger for bread or a thirst for water, But rather [a hunger] for hearing the words of the LORD. 















###### 12 







"People shall stagger from sea to sea [to the very ends of the earth] And from the north even to the east; They will roam here and there to seek the word of the LORD [longing for it as essential for life], But they will not find it. 















###### 13 







"In that day the beautiful virgins And [even the vigorous] young men shall faint from thirst. 















###### 14 







"Those who swear [their oaths] by the sin (guilt) of Samaria _or_ Ashimah (a pagan goddess), Who say, 'By the life of your god [the golden calf], O Dan!' And [swear], 'By the life of the way of [idolatrous] Beersheba,' They shall fall and not rise again." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

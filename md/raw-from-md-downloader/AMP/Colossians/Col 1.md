# Colossians 1

***
















###### 1 







Paul, an apostle (special messenger, personally chosen representative) of Christ Jesus (the Messiah, the Anointed) by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, 















###### 2 







To the [^a]saints and faithful [^b]believers in Christ [who are] at Colossae: Grace to you and peace [inner calm and spiritual well-being] from God our Father. 















###### 3 







We give thanks to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, as we pray always for you, 















###### 4 







for we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus [how you lean on Him with absolute confidence in His power, wisdom, and goodness], and of the [unselfish] [^c]love which you have for all the saints (God's people); 















###### 5 







because of the [confident] hope [of experiencing that] which is reserved _and_ waiting for you in heaven. You previously heard of this _hope_ in the message of truth, the gospel [regarding salvation] 















###### 6 







which has come to you. Indeed, just as in the whole world _the gospel_ is constantly bearing fruit and spreading [by God's power], just as _it has been doing_ among you ever since the day you first heard _of it_ and understood the grace of God in truth [becoming thoroughly and deeply acquainted with it]. 















###### 7 







You learned it from [our representative] Epaphras, our beloved fellow bond-servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf 















###### 8 







and he also has told us of your love [well-grounded and nurtured] in the [Holy] Spirit. 















###### 9 







For this reason, since the day we heard about it, we have not stopped praying for you, asking [specifically] that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom [with insight into His purposes], and in understanding [of spiritual things], 















###### 10 







so that you will walk in a manner worthy of the Lord [displaying admirable character, moral courage, and personal integrity], to [fully] please _Him_ in all things, bearing fruit in every good work and steadily growing in the knowledge of God [with deeper faith, clearer insight and fervent love for His precepts]; 















###### 11 







[we pray that you may be] strengthened _and_ invigorated with all power, according to His glorious might, to attain every kind of endurance and patience with joy; 















###### 12 







giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified us to share in the inheritance of the saints (God's people) in the Light. ## The Incomparable Christ 















###### 13 







For He has rescued us _and_ has drawn us to Himself from the dominion of darkness, and has transferred us to the kingdom of His beloved Son, 















###### 14 







in whom we have redemption [because of His sacrifice, resulting in] the forgiveness of our sins [and the cancellation of sins' penalty]. 















###### 15 







He is the exact living image [the essential manifestation] of the unseen God [the visible representation of the invisible], the firstborn [the preeminent one, the sovereign, and the originator] of all creation. 















###### 16 







For [^d]by Him all things were created in heaven and on earth, [things] visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities; all things were created _and_ exist through Him [that is, by His activity] and for Him. 















###### 17 







And He Himself existed _and_ is before all things, and in Him all things hold together. [His is the controlling, cohesive force of the universe.] 















###### 18 







He is also the head [the life-source and leader] of the body, the [^e]church; and He is the beginning, [^f]the firstborn from the dead, so that He Himself will occupy the first place [He will stand supreme and be preeminent] in everything. 















###### 19 







For it pleased the _Father_ for all the fullness [of deity--the sum total of His essence, all His perfection, powers, and attributes] to dwell [permanently] in Him (the Son), 















###### 20 







and through [the intervention of] the Son to reconcile all things to Himself, making peace [with believers] through the blood of His cross; through Him, [I say,] whether things on earth or things in heaven. 















###### 21 







And although you were at one time estranged _and_ alienated and hostile-minded [toward Him], _participating_ in evil things, 















###### 22 







yet Christ has now reconciled you [to God] in His [^g]physical body through death, in order to present you before the Father holy and blameless and beyond reproach-- 















###### 23 







[and He will do this] if you continue in the faith, well-grounded and steadfast, and not shifting away from the [confident] hope [that is a result] of the gospel that you have heard, which was proclaimed [^h]in all creation under heaven, and of which [gospel] I, Paul, was made a minister. 















###### 24 







Now I rejoice in my sufferings on your behalf. And with my own body I [^i]supplement whatever is lacking [on our part] of Christ's afflictions, on behalf of His body, which is the church. 















###### 25 







In _this church_ I was made a minister according to the stewardship which God entrusted to me for your sake, so that I might make the word of God fully known [among you]-- 















###### 26 







_that is_, [^j]the mystery which was hidden [from angels and mankind] for ages and generations, but has now been revealed to His saints (God's people). 















###### 27 







God [in His eternal plan] chose to make known to them how great for the Gentiles are the riches of the glory of this mystery, which is Christ in _and_ among you, the hope _and_ guarantee of [realizing the] glory. 















###### 28 







We proclaim Him, warning and instructing everyone in all wisdom [that is, with comprehensive insight into the word and purposes of God], so that we may present every person complete in Christ [mature, fully trained, and perfect in Him--the Anointed]. 















###### 29 







For this I labor [often to the point of exhaustion], striving with His power _and_ energy, which so greatly works within me. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: Colossians 1:2 Lit _brethren_. [^c]: Colossians 1:4 The key to understanding this and other statements about love is to know that this love (the Greek word _agape_) is not so much a matter of emotion as it is of doing things for the benefit of another person, that is, having an unselfish concern for another and a willingness to seek the best for another. [^d]: Colossians 1:16 Or _in_. [^e]: Colossians 1:18 This refers to the entire body of born-again believers (whether past, present, or future), not a local congregation. [^f]: Colossians 1:18 Christ is the first to be resurrected with an incorruptible, immortal body. Others who were raised had to die again. [^g]: Colossians 1:22 Lit _body of flesh_. [^h]: Colossians 1:23 Paul may be referring to the fact that the created world displays proof of the existence of an omnipotent, benevolent God (cf Rom 1:20), without whom there would be no possibility of salvation. Such a God is the foundation of the “good news.” [^i]: Colossians 1:24 I.e. since the church is Christ’s body, figuratively speaking, whatever the church suffers can be considered additional sufferings by Christ Himself, and all such suffering was ordained and destined by God; what is left to suffer in God’s plan is what is “lacking of Christ’s afflictions.” Paul, as a member of the church, was destined to suffer through persecution etc., thereby taking his share of the church body’s divinely-ordained suffering. [^j]: Colossians 1:26 I.e. that believing Gentiles would be united with believing Jews into one body of believers.

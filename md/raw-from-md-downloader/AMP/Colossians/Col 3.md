# Colossians 3

***
















###### 1 







Therefore if you have been raised with Christ [to a new life, sharing in His resurrection from the dead], keep seeking the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. 















###### 2 







Set your mind _and_ keep focused _habitually_ on the things above [the heavenly things], not on things that are on the earth [which have only temporal value]. 















###### 3 







For you died [to this world], and your [new, real] life is hidden with Christ in God. 















###### 4 







When Christ, who is our life, [^a]appears, then you also will appear with Him in glory. 















###### 5 







So put to death _and_ deprive of power the evil longings of your earthly body [with its sensual, self-centered instincts] immorality, impurity, _sinful_ passion, evil desire, and greed, which is [a kind of] idolatry [because it replaces your devotion to God]. 















###### 6 







Because of these [sinful] things the [divine] wrath of God is coming [^b]on the sons of disobedience [those who fail to listen and who routinely and obstinately disregard God's precepts], 















###### 7 







and in these [sinful things] you also once walked, when you were _habitually_ living in them [without the knowledge of Christ]. 















###### 8 







But now rid yourselves [completely] of all these things: anger, rage, malice, slander, and obscene (abusive, filthy, vulgar) language from your mouth. 















###### 9 







Do not lie to one another, for you have stripped off the old self with its _evil_ practices, 















###### 10 







and have put on the new [spiritual] self who is being _continually_ renewed in true knowledge in the image of Him who created the new self-- 















###### 11 







_a renewal_ in which there is no [distinction between] Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, [nor between nations whether] [^c]barbarian or [^d]Scythian, [nor in status whether] slave or free, but Christ is all, and in all [so believers are equal in Christ, without distinction]. 















###### 12 







So, as God's own chosen people, who are holy [set apart, sanctified for His purpose] and well-beloved [by God Himself], put on a heart of compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience [which has the power to endure whatever injustice or unpleasantness comes, with good temper]; 















###### 13 







bearing graciously with one another, and willingly forgiving each other if one has a cause for complaint against another; just as the Lord has forgiven you, so should you forgive. 















###### 14 







Beyond all these things put on _and_ wrap yourselves in [unselfish] love, which is the perfect bond of unity [for everything is bound together in agreement when each one seeks the best for others]. 















###### 15 







Let the peace of Christ [the inner calm of one who walks daily with Him] be the controlling factor in your hearts [deciding and settling questions that arise]. To this _peace_ indeed you were called as members in one body [of believers]. And be thankful [to God always]. 















###### 16 







Let the [spoken] word of Christ have its home within you [dwelling in your heart and mind--permeating every aspect of your being] as you teach [spiritual things] and admonish _and_ train one another with all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs with thankfulness in your hearts to God. 















###### 17 







Whatever you do [no matter what it is] in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus [and in dependence on Him], giving thanks to God the Father through Him. ## Family Relations 















###### 18 







Wives, be [^e]subject to your husbands [out of respect for their position as protector, and their accountability to God], as is proper _and_ [^f]fitting in the Lord. 















###### 19 







Husbands, love your wives [with an affectionate, sympathetic, selfless love that always seeks the best for them] and do not be embittered _or_ resentful toward them [because of the responsibilities of marriage]. 















###### 20 







Children, obey your parents [as God's representatives] in all things, for this [attitude of respect and obedience] is well-pleasing [^g]to the Lord [and will bring you God's promised blessings]. 















###### 21 







Fathers, do not provoke _or_ irritate _or_ exasperate your children [with demands that are trivial or unreasonable or humiliating or abusive; nor by favoritism or indifference; treat them tenderly with lovingkindness], so they will not lose heart _and_ become discouraged _or_ unmotivated [with their spirits broken]. 















###### 22 







Servants, in everything obey those who are your masters on earth, not only with external service, as those who merely please people, but with sincerity of heart because of your fear of the Lord. 















###### 23 







Whatever you do [whatever your task may be], work from the soul [that is, put in your very best effort], as [something done] for the Lord and not for men, 















###### 24 







knowing [with all certainty] that it is from the Lord [not from men] that you will receive the inheritance which is your [greatest] reward. It is the Lord Christ whom you [actually] serve. 















###### 25 







For he who does wrong will be punished for his wrongdoing, and [with God] there is no partiality [no special treatment based on a person's position in life]. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

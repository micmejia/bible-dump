# Daniel 12

***
















###### 1 







"Now at that [end] time Michael, the great [angelic] prince who stands _guard_ over the children of your people, will arise. And there will be a time of distress such as never occurred since there was a nation until that time; but at that time your people, everyone who is found written in the [^a]Book [of Life], will be rescued. 















###### 2 







Many of those who sleep in the dust of the ground will awake (resurrect), these to everlasting life, but some to disgrace and everlasting contempt (abhorrence). 















###### 3 







Those who are [spiritually] wise will shine brightly like the brightness of the expanse of heaven, and those who lead many to righteousness, [will shine] like the stars forever and ever. 















###### 4 







But as for you, Daniel, conceal these words and seal up the scroll until the end of time. Many will go back and forth _and_ search anxiously [through the scroll], and knowledge [of the purpose of God as revealed by His prophets] will [greatly] increase." 















###### 5 







Then I, Daniel, looked, and behold, there stood two others, the one [angel] on this bank of the river and the other [angel] on that bank of the river. 















###### 6 







And one said to the man dressed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, "How long _will it be_ until the end of these wonders?" 















###### 7 







And I heard the man dressed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, as he held up his right hand and his left hand toward heaven, and swore by Him who lives forever that it would be for a time, times, and a half a time (three and a half years); and as soon as they finish shattering _and_ crushing the power of the holy people, all these things will be finished. 















###### 8 







As for me, I heard, but I did not understand; so I said, "My lord, what will be the outcome of these things?" 















###### 9 







And the angel said, "Go _your way_, Daniel, for the words are concealed and sealed up until the end of time. 















###### 10 







Many will be purged, purified (made white) and refined, but the wicked will behave wickedly. None of the wicked shall understand, but those who are [spiritually] wise will understand. 















###### 11 







From the time that the regular sacrifice [that is, the daily burnt offering] is taken away and the abomination of desolation is set up [ruining the temple for worship of the true God], _there will be_ [^b]1,290 days. 















###### 12 







How blessed [happy, fortunate, spiritually prosperous] _and_ beloved is he who waits expectantly [enduring without wavering for the period of tribulation] and comes to the [^c]1,335 days! 















###### 13 







But as for you (Daniel), go _your way_ until the end [of your [^d]life]; for you will rest and rise _again_ for your allotted inheritance at the end of the age." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: Daniel 12:11 1,290 is 30 days more than 3 1/2 years of 360 day years (1,260 days). The extra 30 days allows for the judgment that will take place after the second coming of Christ. [^c]: Daniel 12:12 The difference between this number and that in v 11 is 45 days, an interval that is not explained. The ancient rabbis speculated that when the Messiah comes, He will lead Israel into the wilderness and then disappear for 45 days to test their faith. The true believers will wait for Him, the rest will join other nations and eventually die there. [^d]: Daniel 12:13 Daniel was now over ninety years of age.

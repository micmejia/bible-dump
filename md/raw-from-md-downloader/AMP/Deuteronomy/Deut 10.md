# Deuteronomy 10

***
















###### 1 







"At that time the LORD said to me, 'Cut out for yourself two tablets of stone like the first, and come up to Me on the mountain, and make an ark (chest) of wood for yourself. 















###### 2 







I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets which you shattered, and you shall put them in the ark.' 















###### 3 







So I made an ark of acacia wood and cut out two tablets of stone like the first, and went up the mountain [^a]with the two tablets in my hand. 















###### 4 







The LORD wrote on the tablets, like the first writing, the Ten [^b]Commandments which the LORD had spoken to you on the mountain from the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly; then the LORD gave them to me. 















###### 5 







Then I turned and came down from the mountain and put the tablets in the ark which I had made; and they are there, just as the LORD commanded me." 















###### 6 







**(**Now the sons of Israel traveled from the wells of the sons of Jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died and there he was buried and Eleazar his son ministered as priest in his place. 















###### 7 







From there they traveled to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of brooks of water. 















###### 8 







At that time the LORD set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to serve Him and to bless in His name until this day. 















###### 9 







Therefore, Levi does not have a portion or inheritance [of tribal land] with his brothers; [^c]the LORD is his inheritance, as the LORD your God [^d]has promised him.**)** 















###### 10 







"And I stayed on the mountain, like the first time, forty days and nights, and the LORD listened to me at that time also; the LORD was not willing to destroy you. 















###### 11 







Then the LORD said to me, 'Arise, go on your journey ahead of the people, so that they may go in and take possession of the land which I swore to their fathers to give to them.' 















###### 12 







"And now, Israel, what does the LORD your God require from you, but to fear [and worship] the LORD your God [with awe-filled reverence and profound respect], to walk [that is, to live each and every day] in all His ways and to love Him, and to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul [your choices, your thoughts, your whole being], 















###### 13 







_and_ to keep the commandments of the LORD and His statutes which I am commanding you today for your good? 















###### 14 







Behold, the heavens and the highest of heavens belong to the LORD your God, the earth and all that is in it. 















###### 15 







Yet the LORD [^e]had a delight in loving your fathers _and_ set His affection on them, and He chose their descendants after them, you above all peoples, as it is this day. 















###### 16 







So circumcise [that is, remove sin from] your heart, and be stiff-necked (stubborn, obstinate) no longer. 















###### 17 







For the LORD your [^f]God is the God of gods and the Lord of lords, the great, the mighty, the awesome God who does not show [^g]partiality nor take a bribe. 















###### 18 







He [^h]executes justice for the orphan and the widow, and [^i]shows His love for the stranger (resident alien, foreigner) by giving him food and clothing. 















###### 19 







Therefore, show your love for the stranger, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt. 















###### 20 







You shall fear [and worship] the LORD your God [with awe-filled reverence and profound respect]; you shall serve Him and cling to Him [hold tightly to Him, be united with Him], and you shall swear [oaths] by His name. 















###### 21 







He is your praise _and_ glory; He is your God, who has done for you these great and awesome things which you have seen with your own eyes. 















###### 22 







Your fathers went down to Egypt, seventy persons [in all], and now the LORD your God has made you as numerous as the stars of heaven. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

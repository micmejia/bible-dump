# Deuteronomy 22

***
















###### 1 







"You shall not see your countryman's ox or his sheep straying away _or_ being stolen, and [^a]ignore [your duty to help] them; you shall certainly take them back to him. 















###### 2 







If your countryman is not nearby or you do not know him, you shall bring the animal to your house, and it shall stay with you until he searches for it; then you shall return it to him. 















###### 3 







You shall do this with his donkey or with his garment or with anything that your countryman has lost and you have found. You are not allowed to ignore [your duty to help] them. 















###### 4 







You shall not see your countryman's donkey or his ox fall down along the road, and ignore [your duty to help] them; you shall certainly help him lift it up. 















###### 5 







"A woman shall not wear a man's clothing, nor shall a man put on a woman's clothing; for whoever does these things is utterly repulsive to the LORD your God. 















###### 6 







"If you happen to come upon a bird's nest along the road, in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs, and the mother [bird] is sitting on the young or on the eggs, you shall not take the mother with the young. 















###### 7 







You shall certainly let the mother go, but you may take the young for yourself, so that it may be well with you and that you may prolong your days. 















###### 8 







"When you build a new house, you shall make a railing (parapet) around your [flat] roof, so that you do not bring the guilt of [innocent] blood on your house if someone falls from it. 















###### 9 







"You shall not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed, or everything produced by the seed which you have sown and the yield of the vineyard will become defiled [and banned for use]. 















###### 10 







"You shall not plow with an ox [a clean animal] and a donkey [an unclean animal] [^b]together. 















###### 11 







"You shall not wear a fabric made of wool and linen blended together [a fabric pagans believed to be magical]. 















###### 12 







"You shall make tassels for yourself on the four corners of your outer garment with which you cover yourself. ## Laws on Morality 















###### 13 







"If any man takes a wife and goes in to her and then scorns _and_ hates her, 















###### 14 







and charges her [without cause] with shameful behavior and [^c]publicly defames her, and says, 'I took this woman, but when I approached her, I did not find in her evidence of virginity,' 















###### 15 







then the young woman's father and her mother shall get and bring out the evidence of her virginity to the elders of the city at the gate [where court is held]. 















###### 16 







The father of the young woman shall say to the elders, 'I gave my daughter to this man as a wife, but he hates her _and_ has turned against her; 















###### 17 







and behold, he has made baseless charges against her, saying, "I did not find in your daughter the evidence of her virginity." But this is the evidence of my daughter's virginity.' And they shall spread out the [^d]garment before the elders of the city. 















###### 18 







Then the elders of that city shall take the man and reprimand him, 















###### 19 







and they shall fine him a hundred _shekels_ of silver and give it to the father of the young woman, because he [^e]publicly defamed a virgin of Israel. And she shall remain his wife; he is not allowed to divorce her as long as he lives. 















###### 20 







"But if this charge is true that the evidence of virginity was not found in the young woman, 















###### 21 







then they shall bring her out to the doorway of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her to death because she has committed a deliberate sin in Israel by playing the prostitute in her father's house. So you shall remove the evil from among you. 















###### 22 







"If a man is [^f]intimate with a woman who is another man's wife, they shall both be put to death, the man who lay with the woman, and the woman. So you shall remove the evil from Israel. 















###### 23 







"If a young woman who is a virgin is engaged (legally betrothed) to a man, and _another_ man finds her in the city and is intimate with her, 















###### 24 







then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city and stone them to death--the young woman because she did not cry out for help [though she was] in the city, and the man because he has violated his neighbor's [promised] wife. So you shall remove the evil from among you. 















###### 25 







"However, if the man finds the girl who is engaged (legally betrothed) in the [open] field, and seizes her and is intimate with her [by force], then only the man who lies with her shall be put to death. 















###### 26 







But you shall do nothing to the young woman; she has committed no sin worthy of death, for this is the same as when a man attacks his neighbor and murders [^g]him. 















###### 27 







When he found her in the [open] field, the engaged girl [may have] cried out for help, but there was no one to [hear and] save her. 















###### 28 







"If a man finds a girl who is a virgin, who is not engaged, and seizes her and is intimate with her and they are discovered, 















###### 29 







then the man who was intimate with her shall give fifty _shekels_ of silver to the girl's father, and she shall become his wife because he has violated her; he can [^h]never divorce her. 















###### 30 







"[^i]A man shall not take his father's [former] wife, so that he will not [^j]expose his father's wife. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

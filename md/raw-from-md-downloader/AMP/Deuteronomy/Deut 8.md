# Deuteronomy 8

***
















###### 1 







"Every commandment that I am commanding you today you shall be careful to do, so that you may live and multiply, and go in and possess the land which the LORD swore [to give] to your fathers. 















###### 2 







And you shall remember [always] all the ways which the LORD your God has led you these forty years in the wilderness, so that He might humble you and test you, to know what was in your heart (mind), whether you would keep His commandments or not. 















###### 3 







He humbled you and allowed you to be hungry and fed you with manna, [a substance] which you did not know, nor did your fathers know, so that He might make you understand [by personal experience] that man does not live by bread alone, but man lives by every _word_ that proceeds out of the mouth of the LORD. 















###### 4 







Your clothing did not wear out on you, nor did your feet swell these forty years. 















###### 5 







Therefore, know in your heart (be fully cognizant) that the LORD your God disciplines _and_ instructs you just as a man disciplines _and_ instructs his son. 















###### 6 







Therefore, you shall keep the commandments of the LORD your God, to walk [that is, to live each and every day] in His ways and fear [and worship] Him [with awe-filled reverence and profound respect]. 















###### 7 







For the LORD your God is bringing you into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and springs, flowing forth in valleys and hills; 















###### 8 







a land of wheat and barley, and vines and fig trees and pomegranates, a land of olive oil and honey; 















###### 9 







a land where you will eat bread without shortage, in which you will lack nothing; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills you can dig copper. 















###### 10 







When you have eaten and are satisfied, then you shall bless the LORD your God for the good land which He has given you. 















###### 11 







"Beware that you do not forget the LORD your God by failing to keep His commandments and His judgments (precepts) and His statutes which I am commanding you today; 















###### 12 







otherwise, when you have eaten and are satisfied, and have built good houses and lived _in them_, 















###### 13 







and when your herds and flocks multiply, and your silver and gold multiply, and all that you have increases, 















###### 14 







then your heart will become lifted up [by self-conceit and arrogance] and you will forget the LORD your God who brought you from the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. 















###### 15 







He led you through the great and terrible wilderness, _with its_ fiery serpents and scorpions and thirsty ground where there was no water; it was He who brought water for you out of the flinty rock. 















###### 16 







He fed you manna in the wilderness, [a substance] which your fathers did not know, so that He might humble you [by dependence on Him] and that He might test you, to do good [things] for you at the end. 















###### 17 







Otherwise, you may say in your heart, 'My power and the strength of my hand made me this wealth.' 















###### 18 







But you shall remember [with profound respect] the LORD your God, for it is He who is giving you power to make wealth, that He may confirm His covenant which He swore (solemnly promised) to your fathers, as it is this day. 















###### 19 







And it shall come about if you ever forget the LORD your God and follow other gods and serve them and worship them, I testify against you today that you will most certainly perish. 















###### 20 







Like the nations which the LORD causes to perish before you, so shall you perish; because you would not listen to _and_ obey the voice of the LORD your God. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

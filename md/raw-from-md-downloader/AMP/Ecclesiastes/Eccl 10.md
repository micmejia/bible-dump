# Ecclesiastes 10

***
















###### 1 







Dead flies make the oil of the perfumer give off a foul odor; so a little foolishness [in one who is esteemed] outweighs wisdom and honor. 















###### 2 







A wise man's heart _turns him_ toward the right [which is the way of blessing], but a fool's heart _turns him_ toward the left [which is the way of condemnation]. 















###### 3 







Even when a fool walks along the road, his [common] sense _and_ good judgment fail him and he demonstrates to everyone that he is a fool. 















###### 4 







If the temper of the ruler rises against you, do not leave your post [showing resistance], because composure _and_ calmness prevent great offenses. 















###### 5 







There is an evil I have seen under the sun, like an error which proceeds from the ruler-- 















###### 6 







folly is set in many exalted places _and_ in great dignity while the rich sit in humble places. 















###### 7 







I have seen slaves _riding_ on horses and princes walking like slaves on the ground. 















###### 8 







He who digs a pit [for others] may fall into it, and a serpent may bite him who breaks through a [stone] wall. 















###### 9 







He who quarries stones may be hurt with them, and he who splits logs may be endangered by them. 















###### 10 







If the axe is dull and he does not sharpen its edge, then he must exert more strength; but wisdom [to sharpen the axe] helps him succeed [with less effort]. 















###### 11 







If the serpent bites before being charmed, then there is no profit for the charmer. 















###### 12 







The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious _and_ win him favor, but the lips of a fool consume him; 















###### 13 







the beginning of [^a]his talking is foolishness and the end of his talk is wicked madness. 















###### 14 







Yet the fool multiplies words, though no man knows what will happen, and who can tell him what will come after he is gone? 















###### 15 







The labor of a fool so wearies him [because he is ignorant] that he does not even know how to go to a city. 















###### 16 







Woe to you, O land, when your king is a child and when your [incompetent] officials _and_ princes feast in the morning. 















###### 17 







Blessed [prosperous and admired] are you, O land, when your king is a man of noble birth, and your princes _and_ officials feast at the proper time--for strength and not for drunkenness. 















###### 18 







Through laziness the rafters [of state affairs] decay _and_ the roof sags, and through idleness [the roof of] the house leaks. 















###### 19 







_The officials_ make a feast for enjoyment [instead of repairing what is broken], and serve wine to make life merry, and money is the answer to everything. 















###### 20 







Moreover, do not curse the king, even in your bedroom, and in your sleeping rooms do not curse the rich, for a bird of the air will carry the sound and a winged creature will make the matter known. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

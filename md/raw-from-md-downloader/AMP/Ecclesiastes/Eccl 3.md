# Ecclesiastes 3

***
















###### 1 







There is a season (a time appointed) for everything and a time for every delight _and_ event _or_ purpose under heaven-- 















###### 2 







A time to be born and a time to die; A time to plant and a time to uproot what is planted. 















###### 3 







A time to kill and a time to heal; A time to tear down and a time to build up. 















###### 4 







A time to weep and a time to laugh; A time to mourn and a time to dance. 















###### 5 







A time to throw away stones and a time to gather stones; A time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing. 















###### 6 







A time to search and a time to give up as lost; A time to keep and a time to throw away. 















###### 7 







A time to [^a]tear apart and a time to sew together; A time to keep silent and a time to speak. 















###### 8 







A time to love and a time to hate; A time for war and a time for peace. 















###### 9 







What profit is there for the worker from that in which he labors? 















###### 10 







I have seen the task which God has given to the sons of men with which to occupy themselves. ## God Set Eternity in the Heart of Man 















###### 11 







He has made everything beautiful _and_ appropriate in its time. He has also planted eternity [a sense of divine purpose] in the human heart [a mysterious longing which nothing under the sun can satisfy, except God]--yet man cannot find out (comprehend, grasp) what God has done (His overall plan) from the beginning to the end. 















###### 12 







I know that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice and to do good as long as they live; 















###### 13 







and also that every man should eat and drink and see _and_ enjoy the good of all his labor--it is the gift of God. 















###### 14 







I know that whatever God does, it endures forever; nothing can be added to it nor can anything be taken from it, for God does it so that men will fear _and_ worship Him [with awe-filled reverence, knowing that He is God]. 















###### 15 







That which is has already been, and that which will be has already been, for God seeks what has passed by [so that history repeats itself]. 















###### 16 







Moreover, I have seen under the sun that in the place of justice there is wickedness, and in the place of righteousness there is wickedness. 















###### 17 







I said to myself, "God will judge both the righteous and the wicked," for there is a time [appointed] for every matter and for every deed. 















###### 18 







I said to myself regarding the sons of men, "God is surely testing them in order for them to see that [by themselves, without God] they are [only] animals." 















###### 19 







For the [earthly] fate of the sons of men and the fate of animals is the same. As one dies, so dies the other; indeed, they all have the same breath and there is no preeminence _or_ advantage for man [in and of himself] over an animal, for all is vanity. 















###### 20 







All go to the same place. All came from the dust and all return to the dust. 















###### 21 







Who knows if the spirit of man ascends upward and the spirit of the animal descends downward to the earth? 















###### 22 







So I have seen that there is nothing better than that a man should be happy in his own works _and_ activities, for that is his portion (share). For who will bring him [back] to see what will happen after he is gone? ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

Cf Gen 37:29. There are many references to this in the Old Testament. Solomon was no doubt familiar with this practice as his own father engaged in it with his contemporaries. Cf 2 Sam 3:31.

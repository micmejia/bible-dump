# Ecclesiastes 4

***
















###### 1 







Then I looked again _and_ considered all the acts of oppression that were being practiced under the sun. And behold _I saw_ the tears of the oppressed and they had no one to comfort them; and on the side of their oppressors was power, but they had no one to comfort them. 















###### 2 







So I congratulated _and_ thought more fortunate are those who are already dead than the living who are still living. 















###### 3 







But better off than either of them is the one who has not yet been born, who has not seen the evil deeds that are done under the sun. 















###### 4 







I have seen that every [effort in] labor and every skill in work _comes from_ man's rivalry with his neighbor. This too is vanity (futility, false pride) and chasing after the wind. 















###### 5 







The fool folds his hands [together] and consumes his own flesh [destroying himself by idleness and apathy]. 















###### 6 







One hand full of rest _and_ patience is better than two fists full of labor and chasing after the wind. 















###### 7 







Then I looked again at vanity under the sun [in one of its peculiar forms]. 















###### 8 







There was a certain man--without a dependent, having neither a child nor a brother, yet there was no end to all his labor. Indeed, his eyes were not satisfied with riches _and he never asked_, "For whom do I labor and deprive myself of pleasure?" This too is vanity (a wisp of smoke, self-conceit); yes, it is a painful effort _and_ an unhappy task. 















###### 9 







Two are better than one because they have a more satisfying return for their labor; 















###### 10 







for if [^a]either of them falls, the one will lift up his companion. But woe to him who is alone when he falls and does not have another to lift him up. 















###### 11 







Again, if two lie down together, then they keep warm; but how can one be warm _alone_? 















###### 12 







And though one can overpower him who is alone, two can resist him. A cord of three _strands_ is not quickly broken. 















###### 13 







A poor yet wise youth is better than an old and foolish king who [^b]no longer knows how to receive instruction _and_ counsel (friendly reproof, warning)-- 















###### 14 







for the poor youth has [used his wisdom and] come out of prison to become king, even though he was born poor in his kingdom. 















###### 15 







I have seen all the living under the sun join with the second youth (the king's acknowledged successor) who replaces him. 















###### 16 







There is no end to all the people; to all who were before them. Yet those who come later will not be happy with him. Surely this also is vanity (emptiness) and chasing after the wind. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

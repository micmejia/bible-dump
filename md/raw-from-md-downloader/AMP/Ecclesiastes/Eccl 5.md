# Ecclesiastes 5

***
















###### 1 







Guard your steps _and_ focus on what you are doing as you go to the house of God and draw near to listen rather than to offer the [careless or irreverent] sacrifice of fools; for they are too ignorant to know they are doing evil. 















###### 2 







Do not be hasty with your mouth [speaking careless words or vows] or impulsive in thought to bring up a matter before God. For God is in heaven and you are on earth; therefore let your words be few. 















###### 3 







For the dream comes through much effort, and the voice of the fool through many words. 















###### 4 







When you make a vow _or_ a pledge to God, do not put off paying it; for _God takes_ no pleasure in fools [who thoughtlessly mock Him]. Pay what you vow. 















###### 5 







It is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not pay. 















###### 6 







Do not allow your speech to cause you to sin, and do not say before the messenger (priest) _of God_ that it was a mistake. Why should God be angry because of your voice (words) and destroy the work of your hands? 















###### 7 







For in a multitude of dreams and in a flood of words there is worthlessness. Rather [reverently] fear God [and worship Him with awe-filled respect, knowing who He is]. 















###### 8 







If you see the oppression of the poor and the denial of justice and righteousness in the province, do not be shocked at the sight [of corruption]; for a higher official watches over another official, and there are higher ones over them [looking out for one another]. 















###### 9 







After all, a king who cultivates the field is an advantage to the land. ## The Folly of Riches 















###### 10 







He who loves money will not be satisfied with money, nor he who loves abundance _with its_ gain. This too is vanity (emptiness). 















###### 11 







When good things increase, those who consume them increase. So what advantage is there to their owners except to see them with their eyes? 















###### 12 







The sleep of a working man is sweet, whether he eats little or much; but the full stomach (greed) of the rich [who hungers for even more] will not let him sleep. 















###### 13 







There is a grievous evil which I have seen under the sun: riches being kept _and_ hoarded by their owner to his own misery. 















###### 14 







For when those riches are lost in bad investments and he becomes the father of a son, then there is nothing in his hand [for the support of the child]. 















###### 15 







As he came naked from his mother's womb, so he will return as he came; and he will take away nothing from all his labor that he can carry in his hand. 















###### 16 







This also is a grievous evil--exactly as he was born, so he shall die. So what advantage has he who labors for the wind? 















###### 17 







All of his life he also eats in darkness [cheerlessly, without sweetness and light], with great frustration, sickness, and anger. 















###### 18 







Behold, here is what I have seen to be good and fitting: to eat and drink, and to find enjoyment in all the labor in which he labors under the sun during the few days of his life which God gives him--for this is his [allotted] reward. 















###### 19 







Also, every man to whom God has given riches and possessions, He has also given the power _and_ ability to enjoy them and to receive [this as] his [allotted] portion and to rejoice in his labor--this is the gift of God [to him]. 















###### 20 







For he will not often consider the [troubled] days of his life, because God keeps him occupied _and_ focused on the joy of his heart [and the tranquility of God indwells him]. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

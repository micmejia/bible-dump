# Ecclesiastes 6

***
















###### 1 







There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it weighs heavily on men: 















###### 2 







a man to whom God has given riches and wealth and honor, so that he lacks nothing of all that he desires, yet God has not given him the power _or_ capacity to enjoy them [all those things which are gifts from God], but a stranger [in whom he has no interest succeeds him and] enjoys them. This is vanity and it is a [cause of] great distress. 















###### 3 







If a man fathers a hundred _children_ and lives many years, however many they may be, but his soul is not satisfied with good things and he is not respected _and_ is not given a _proper_ burial [he is not laid to rest in the sepulcher of his fathers], then I say, "Better the miscarriage than he, 















###### 4 







for the miscarriage comes in futility (in vain) and passes into obscurity; and its name is covered in obscurity. 















###### 5 







It has not seen the sun nor had any knowledge; yet it has more rest _and_ is better off than he. 















###### 6 







Even if the _other_ man lives a thousand years twice over and yet has seen no good _and_ experienced no enjoyment--do not both go to one place [the grave]?" 















###### 7 







All the labor of man is for his mouth [for self-preservation and enjoyment], and yet the desire [of his soul] is not satisfied. 















###### 8 







For what advantage has the wise man over the fool [for being worldly-wise is not the secret to happiness]? What _advantage_ has the poor man who has learned how to walk [publicly] among the living [with men's eyes on him; for being poor is not the secret to happiness either]? 















###### 9 







What the eyes see [enjoying what is available] is better than [craving] what the soul desires. This too is futility and chasing after the wind. 















###### 10 







Whatever exists has already been named [long ago], and it is known what [a frail being] man is; for he cannot dispute with Him who is mightier than he. 















###### 11 







For there are many other words that increase futility. What then is the advantage for a man? 















###### 12 







For who [[^a]limited by human wisdom] knows what is good for man during his lifetime, during the few days of his futile life? He spends them like a shadow [staying busy, but achieving nothing of lasting value]. For who can tell a man what will happen after him [to his work, his treasure, his plans] under the sun [after his life is over]? ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

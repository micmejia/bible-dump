# Ephesians 1

***
















###### 1 







Paul, an apostle (special messenger, personally chosen representative) of Christ Jesus (the Messiah, the Anointed), by the will of God [that is, by His purpose and choice], To the [^a]saints (God's people) [^b]who are at Ephesus and are faithful _and_ loyal _and_ steadfast in Christ Jesus: 















###### 2 







Grace to you and peace [inner calm and spiritual well-being] from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 















###### 3 







[^c]Blessed _and_ worthy of praise be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms in Christ, 















###### 4 







just as [in His love] He chose us in Christ [actually selected us for Himself as His own] before the foundation of the world, so that we would be holy [that is, consecrated, set apart for Him, purpose-driven] and blameless in His sight. In love 















###### 5 







He predestined _and_ lovingly planned for us to be adopted to Himself as [His own] children through Jesus Christ, in accordance with the kind intention _and_ good pleasure of His will-- 















###### 6 







to the praise of His glorious grace _and_ favor, which He so freely bestowed on us in the Beloved [His Son, Jesus Christ]. 















###### 7 







In Him we have redemption [that is, our deliverance and salvation] through His blood, [which paid the penalty for our sin and resulted in] the forgiveness _and_ complete pardon of our sin, in accordance with the riches of His grace 















###### 8 







which He lavished on us. In all wisdom and understanding [with practical insight] 















###### 9 







He made known to us the mystery of His will according to His good pleasure, which He purposed in Christ, 















###### 10 







with regard to the fulfillment of the times [that is, the end of history, the climax of the ages]--to bring all things together in Christ, [both] things in the heavens and things on the earth. 















###### 11 







In Him also we have [^d]received an inheritance [a destiny--we were claimed by God as His own], having been predestined (chosen, appointed beforehand) according to the purpose of Him who works everything in agreement with the counsel _and_ design of His will, 















###### 12 







so that we who were the first to hope in Christ [who first put our confidence in Him as our Lord and Savior] would exist to the praise of His glory. 















###### 13 







In Him, you also, when you heard the word of truth, the good news of your salvation, and [as a result] believed in Him, were stamped with the seal of the promised Holy Spirit [the One promised by Christ] as owned _and_ protected [by God]. 















###### 14 







The Spirit is the [^e]guarantee [the first installment, the pledge, a foretaste] of our inheritance until the redemption of _God's own_ [purchased] possession [His believers], to the praise of His glory. 















###### 15 







For this reason, because I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all God's people, 















###### 16 







I do not cease to give thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers; 















###### 17 







[I always pray] that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may grant you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation [that gives you a deep and personal and intimate insight] into the true knowledge of Him [for we know the Father through the Son]. 















###### 18 







And [I pray] that the eyes of your heart [the very center and core of your being] may be enlightened [flooded with light by the Holy Spirit], so that you will know _and_ cherish the [^f]hope [the divine guarantee, the confident expectation] to which He has called you, the riches of His glorious inheritance in the [^g]saints (God's people), 















###### 19 







and [so that you will begin to know] what the immeasurable _and_ unlimited _and_ surpassing greatness of His [active, spiritual] power is in us who believe. These are in accordance with the working of His mighty strength 















###### 20 







which He [^h]produced in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His own right hand in the heavenly _places_, 















###### 21 







far above all rule and authority and power and dominion [whether angelic or human], and [far above] every name that is named [above every title that can be conferred], not only in this age _and_ world but also in the one to come. 















###### 22 







And He [^i]put all things [in every realm] in subjection under Christ's feet, and [^j]appointed Him as [supreme and authoritative] head over all things in the church, 















###### 23 







which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills _and_ completes all things in all [believers]. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

All believers are holy, that is, set apart or sanctified for God’s purpose. [^b]: Ephesians 1:1 Three early mss do not contain “at Ephesus.” Some scholars suggest that this was intended as a circular letter for various churches of Asia Minor (modern Turkey), sent first to Ephesus and then to the other churches. See Paul’s instruction to the Colossians in 4:16. Others believe the letter was directed only to the Ephesians because of its many personal references. The books of Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Philemon are believed to have been written by Paul while he was a prisoner under house arrest in Rome (a.d. 60-62) (cf 6:20). [^c]: Ephesians 1:3 In Greek this passage (vv 3-14), also referred to as a doxology, is one sentence. [^d]: Ephesians 1:11 Or _our destiny_. [^e]: Ephesians 1:14 Or _down payment_. [^f]: Ephesians 1:18 In the NT the word “hope” expresses a cherished desire along with the confident assurance of obtaining that which is longed for. [^g]: Ephesians 1:18 See note v 1. [^h]: Ephesians 1:20 The first of three manifestations of God’s power exhibited in Christ. [^i]: Ephesians 1:22 The second manifestation of God’s power exhibited in Christ. [^j]: Ephesians 1:22 This is the third manifestation of God’s power exhibited in Christ.

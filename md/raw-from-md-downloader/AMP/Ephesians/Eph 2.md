# Ephesians 2

***
















###### 1 







And you [He made alive when you] were [spiritually] dead _and_ separated from Him because of your transgressions and sins, 















###### 2 







in which you once walked. You were following the ways of this world [influenced by this present age], in accordance with the prince of the power of the air (Satan), the spirit who is now at work in the disobedient [the unbelieving, who fight against the purposes of God]. 















###### 3 







Among these [unbelievers] we all once lived in the passions of our flesh [our behavior governed by the sinful self], indulging the desires of [^a]human nature [without the Holy Spirit] and [the impulses] of the [sinful] mind. We were, by nature, children [under the sentence] of [God's] wrath, just like the rest [of mankind]. 















###### 4 







But God, being [so very] rich in mercy, because of His great _and_ wonderful love with which He loved us, 















###### 5 







even when we were [spiritually] dead _and_ separated from Him because of our sins, He made us [spiritually] alive together with Christ **(**for by His grace--His undeserved favor and mercy--you have been saved from God's judgment**)**. 















###### 6 







And He raised us up together with Him [when we believed], and seated us with Him in the heavenly _places_, [because we are] in Christ Jesus, 















###### 7 







[and He did this] so that in the ages to come He might [clearly] show the immeasurable _and_ unsurpassed riches of His grace in [His] kindness toward us in Christ Jesus [by providing for our redemption]. 















###### 8 







For it is by grace [God's remarkable compassion and favor drawing you to Christ] that you have been saved [actually delivered from judgment and given eternal life] through faith. And this [salvation] is not of yourselves [not through your own effort], but it is the [undeserved, gracious] gift of God; 















###### 9 







not as a result of [your] works [nor your attempts to keep the Law], so that no one will [be able to] boast _or_ take credit in any way [for his salvation]. 















###### 10 







For we are His workmanship [His own master work, a work of art], created in Christ Jesus [reborn from above--spiritually transformed, renewed, ready to be used] for good works, which God prepared [for us] beforehand [taking paths which He set], so that we would walk in them [living the good life which He prearranged and made ready for us]. 















###### 11 







Therefore, remember that at one time you Gentiles by birth, who are called "Uncircumcision" by those who called themselves "Circumcision," [itself a mere mark] _which is_ made in the flesh by human hands-- 















###### 12 







_remember_ that at that time you were separated from Christ [excluded from any relationship with Him], alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise [with no share in the sacred Messianic promise and without knowledge of God's agreements], having no hope [in His promise] and [living] in the world without God. 















###### 13 







But now [at this very moment] in Christ Jesus you who once were [so very] far away [from God] have been brought near [^b]by the blood of Christ. 















###### 14 







For He Himself is our peace _and_ our bond of unity. He who made both _groups_--[Jews and Gentiles]--_into_ one body and broke down the barrier, the dividing wall [of spiritual antagonism between us], 















###### 15 







by abolishing in His [own crucified] flesh the hostility _caused by_ the Law with its commandments _contained_ in ordinances [which He satisfied]; so that in Himself He might make the two into one new man, thereby establishing peace. 















###### 16 







And [that He] might reconcile them both [Jew and Gentile, united] in one body to God through the cross, thereby putting to death the hostility. 















###### 17 







And He came and preached the good news of peace to you [Gentiles] who were far away, and peace to those [Jews] who were near. 















###### 18 







For it is through Him that we both have a [direct] way of approach in one Spirit to the Father. 















###### 19 







So then you are no longer strangers and aliens [outsiders without rights of citizenship], but you are fellow citizens with the saints (God's people), and are [members] of God's household, 















###### 20 







having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus Himself as the [chief] Cornerstone, 















###### 21 







in whom the whole structure is joined together, and it continues [to increase] growing into a holy temple in the Lord [a sanctuary dedicated, set apart, and sacred to the presence of the Lord]. 















###### 22 







In Him [and in fellowship with one another] you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in the Spirit. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

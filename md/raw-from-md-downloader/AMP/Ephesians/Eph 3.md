# Ephesians 3

***
















###### 1 







For this reason [because I preach that you and believing Jews are joint heirs] I, Paul, am the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles-- 















###### 2 







assuming that you have heard of the stewardship of God's grace that was entrusted to me [to share with you] for your benefit; 















###### 3 







and that by [divine] revelation the mystery was made known to me, as I have already written in brief. 















###### 4 







By referring to this, when you read it you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ, 















###### 5 







which in other generations was not disclosed to mankind, as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets by the [Holy] Spirit; 















###### 6 







[it is this:] that the Gentiles are now joint heirs [with the Jews] and members of the same body, and joint partakers [sharing] in the [same divine] promise in Christ Jesus through [their faith in] the good news [of salvation]. 















###### 7 







Of this [gospel] I was made a minister by the gift of God's grace given me through the working of His power. 















###### 8 







To me, [though I am] the very least of all the saints (God's people), this grace [which is undeserved] was graciously given, to proclaim to the Gentiles the good news of the incomprehensible riches of Christ [that spiritual wealth which no one can fully understand], 















###### 9 







and to make plain [to everyone] the plan of the mystery [regarding the uniting of believing Jews and Gentiles into one body] which [until now] was kept hidden through the ages in [the mind of] God who created all things. 















###### 10 







So now through the church the multifaceted wisdom of God [in all its countless aspects] might now be made known [revealing the mystery] to the [angelic] rulers and authorities in the heavenly _places_. 















###### 11 







_This is_ in accordance with [the terms of] the eternal purpose which He carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord, 















###### 12 







in whom we have boldness and confident access through faith in Him [that is, our faith gives us sufficient courage to freely and openly approach God through Christ]. 















###### 13 







So I ask you not to lose heart at my sufferings on your behalf, for they are your glory _and_ honor. 















###### 14 







For this reason [grasping the greatness of this plan by which Jews and Gentiles are joined together in Christ] I bow my knees [in reverence] before the Father [of our Lord Jesus Christ], 















###### 15 







from whom every family in heaven and on earth [^a]derives its name [God--the first and ultimate Father]. 















###### 16 







May He grant you out of the riches of His glory, to be strengthened _and_ spiritually energized with power through His Spirit in your inner self, [indwelling your innermost being and personality], 















###### 17 







so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through your faith. And may you, having been [deeply] rooted and [securely] grounded in love, 















###### 18 







be fully capable of comprehending with all the saints (God's people) the width and length and height and depth of His love [fully experiencing that amazing, endless love]; 















###### 19 







and [that you may come] to know [practically, through personal experience] the love of Christ which far surpasses [mere] knowledge [without experience], that you may be filled up [throughout your being] to all the fullness of God [so that you may have the richest experience of God's presence in your lives, completely filled and flooded with God Himself]. 















###### 20 







Now to Him who is able to [carry out His purpose and] do superabundantly more than all that we dare ask or think [infinitely beyond our greatest prayers, hopes, or dreams], according to His power that is at work within us, 















###### 21 







to Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations forever and ever. Amen. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Ephesians 4

***
















###### 1 







So I, the prisoner for the Lord, appeal to you to live a life worthy of the calling to which you have been called [that is, to live a life that exhibits godly character, moral courage, personal integrity, and mature behavior--a life that expresses gratitude to God for your salvation], 















###### 2 







with all humility [forsaking self-righteousness], and gentleness [maintaining self-control], with patience, bearing with one another [^a]in [unselfish] love. 















###### 3 







Make every effort to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the bond of peace [each individual working together to make the whole successful]. 















###### 4 







_There is_ one body [of believers] and one Spirit--just as you were called to one hope when called [to salvation]-- 















###### 5 







one Lord, one faith, one baptism, 















###### 6 







one God and Father of us all who is [sovereign] over all and [working] through all and [living] in all. 















###### 7 







Yet grace [God's undeserved favor] was given to each one of us [not indiscriminately, but in different ways] in proportion to the measure of Christ's [rich and abundant] gift. 















###### 8 







Therefore it says, "When He ascended on high, He led captivity captive, And He bestowed gifts on men." 















###### 9 







**(**Now this _expression_, "He ascended," what does it mean except that He also had _previously_ descended [from the heights of heaven] into the lower parts of the earth? 















###### 10 







He who descended is the _very_ same as He who also has ascended high above all the heavens, that He [His presence] might fill all things [that is, the whole universe]**)**. 















###### 11 







And [His gifts to the church were varied and] He Himself appointed some as apostles [special messengers, representatives], some as prophets [who speak a new message from God to the people], some as evangelists [who spread the good news of salvation], and some as pastors and teachers [to shepherd and guide and instruct], 















###### 12 







[and He did this] to fully equip _and_ perfect the saints (God's people) for works of service, to build up the body of Christ [the church]; 















###### 13 







until we all reach oneness in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God, [growing spiritually] to become a mature believer, reaching to the measure of the fullness of Christ [manifesting His spiritual completeness and exercising our spiritual gifts in unity]. 















###### 14 







So that we are no longer children [spiritually immature], tossed back and forth [like ships on a stormy sea] and carried about by every wind of [shifting] doctrine, by the cunning _and_ trickery of [unscrupulous] men, by the deceitful scheming of people ready to do anything [for personal profit]. 















###### 15 







But speaking the truth in love [in all things--both our speech and our lives expressing His truth], let us grow up in all _things_ into Him [following His example] who is the Head--Christ. 















###### 16 







From Him the whole body [the church, in all its various parts], joined and knitted _firmly_ together by what every joint supplies, when each part is working properly, causes the body to grow _and_ mature, building itself up [^b]in [unselfish] love. ## The Christian's Walk 















###### 17 







So this I say, and solemnly affirm together with the Lord [as in His presence], that you must no longer live as the [unbelieving] Gentiles live, in the futility of their minds [and in the foolishness and emptiness of their souls], 















###### 18 







for their [moral] understanding is darkened _and_ their reasoning is clouded; [they are] alienated _and_ self-banished from the life of God [with no share in it; this is] because of the [willful] ignorance _and_ spiritual blindness that is [deep-seated] within them, because of the hardness _and_ insensitivity of their heart. 















###### 19 







And they, [the ungodly in their spiritual apathy], having become callous _and_ unfeeling, have given themselves over [as prey] to unbridled sensuality, eagerly craving the practice of every kind of impurity [that their desires may demand]. 















###### 20 







But you did not learn Christ in this way! 















###### 21 







If in fact you have [really] heard Him and have been taught by Him, just as truth is in Jesus [revealed in His life and personified in Him], 















###### 22 







that, regarding your previous way of life, you put off your old self [completely discard your former nature], which is being corrupted through deceitful desires, 















###### 23 







and be _continually_ renewed in the spirit of your mind [having a fresh, untarnished mental and spiritual attitude], 















###### 24 







and put on the new self [the regenerated and renewed nature], created in God's image, [godlike] in the righteousness and holiness of the truth [living in a way that expresses to God your gratitude for your salvation]. 















###### 25 







Therefore, rejecting all falsehood [whether lying, defrauding, telling half-truths, spreading rumors, any such as these], speak truth each one with his neighbor, for we are all parts of one another [and we are all parts of the body of Christ]. 















###### 26 







Be angry [at sin--at immorality, at injustice, at ungodly behavior], yet do not sin; do not let your anger [cause you shame, nor allow it to] last until the sun goes down. 















###### 27 







And do not give the devil an opportunity [to lead you into sin by holding a grudge, or nurturing anger, or harboring resentment, or cultivating bitterness]. 















###### 28 







The thief [who has become a believer] must no longer steal, but instead he must work hard [making an honest living], producing that which is good with his own hands, so that he will have _something_ to share with those in need. 















###### 29 







Do not let unwholesome [foul, profane, worthless, vulgar] words ever come out of your mouth, but only such _speech_ as is good for building up others, according to the need _and_ the occasion, so that it will be a blessing to those who hear [you speak]. 















###### 30 







And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God [but seek to please Him], by whom you were sealed _and_ marked [branded as God's own] for the day of redemption [the final deliverance from the consequences of sin]. 















###### 31 







Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor [perpetual animosity, resentment, strife, fault-finding] and slander be put away from you, along with every kind of malice [all spitefulness, verbal abuse, malevolence]. 















###### 32 







Be kind _and_ helpful to one another, tender-hearted [compassionate, understanding], forgiving one another [readily and freely], just as God in Christ also forgave [^c]you. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

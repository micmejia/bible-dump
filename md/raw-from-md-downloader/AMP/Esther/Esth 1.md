# Esther 1

***
















###### 1 







It was in the days of Ahasuerus ([^a]Xerxes) who reigned from India to Ethiopia (Cush) over 127 provinces, 















###### 2 







in those days when King Ahasuerus sat on his royal throne which was at the citadel in [^b]Susa [the capital of the Persian Empire], 















###### 3 







in the third year of his reign he held a banquet for all his officials and his attendants. The army _officers_ of Persia and Media, the nobles and the officials of the provinces were there in his presence. 















###### 4 







And he displayed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the splendor of his great majesty for many days, 180 days _in all_. 















###### 5 







When these days were completed, the king held a banquet for all the people who were present at the citadel in Susa [the capital], from the greatest [in importance] to the least, a seven-day feast in the courtyard of the garden of the king's palace. 















###### 6 







_There were curtains_ (draperies) of fine white and violet linen fastened with cords of fine purple linen to silver rings and marble columns. The couches of gold and silver _rested_ on a mosaic floor of [^c]porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl, and precious _colored_ stones. 















###### 7 







Drinks were served in various kinds of golden goblets, and the royal wine was plentiful, in accordance with the generosity of the king. 















###### 8 







The drinking was _carried on_ in accordance with the law; no one was compelled [to drink], for the king had directed each official of his household to comply with each guest's wishes. 















###### 9 







Queen Vashti also held a [separate] banquet for the women in the palace of King Ahasuerus. ## Queen Vashti's Refusal 















###### 10 







On the seventh day, when the king's heart was joyful with wine (in high spirits), he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carkas, the seven [^d]eunuchs who served in the presence of King Ahasuerus [as his attendants], 















###### 11 







to bring Queen Vashti before the king, [^e]wearing her royal crown (high turban), to display her beauty before the people and the officials, for she was lovely to see. 















###### 12 







But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king's command, which was delivered [to her] by the eunuchs. So the king became extremely angry and burned with rage. 















###### 13 







Then the king spoke to the wise men who understood the times [asking for their advice]--for it was the custom of the king _to speak_ before all those who were familiar with law and legal matters-- 















###### 14 







and who were close to him [as advisors]: Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven officials of Persia and Media who had access to the king and were ranked highest in the kingdom. 















###### 15 







[He said,] "According to the law, what is to be done with Queen Vashti because she did not obey the command of King Ahasuerus _which was conveyed_ by the eunuchs?" 















###### 16 







And Memucan answered in the presence of the king and the officials, "Vashti the queen has not only wronged the king but [also] all the officials (royal representatives) and all the peoples who are in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus. 















###### 17 







For the queen's conduct will become known to all women, causing them to look on their husbands with contempt (disrespect), since they will say, 'King Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought before him, but she did not come.' 















###### 18 







This [very] day the ladies of Persia and Media who have heard of the queen's refusal will speak [in the same way] to all the king's officials, and there will be plenty of contempt and anger. 















###### 19 







If it pleases the king, let a royal command be issued by him and let it be written in the laws of the Persians and Medes so that it cannot be repealed _or_ modified, that Vashti is [^f]no longer to come before King Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal position to another who is better _and_ more worthy than she. 















###### 20 







So when the king's great decree is proclaimed throughout his [extensive] kingdom, all women will give honor to their husbands, from the great to the insignificant." 















###### 21 







This statement (advice) pleased the king and the officials, and the king did what Memucan proposed. 















###### 22 







So he sent letters to all the royal provinces, to each province in its own script and to each people in their own language, saying that every man should be the master _and_ rule in his own home and that [^g]he should speak [in the household] in the language of his own people. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

Xerxes I (also known as Xerxes the Great the son of Darius the Great), ruled 486-465 b.c. He is the Xerxes who invaded Greece, was stopped temporarily at Thermopylae, defeated at the naval battle at Salamis, and nearly annihilated at Plataea (479 b.c.). The French excavations at Susa in 1880-1890 uncovered the great palace of Xerxes, where Esther would have lived. The building covered two and one-half acres. The finds at Susa from this period were so astonishing that the Louvre in Paris devoted two large rooms to the exhibition of the treasures. Xerxes’ tomb (looted in antiquity) is believed to be among the rock-cut tombs located at Naqsh-e Rajab, an archeological site in Iran about ten miles northwest of the site of ancient Persepolis. [^b]: Esther 1:2 Susa was located about a hundred and fifty miles east of the Tigris River. The site, now modern day Shush, Iran, is considered to be one of the world’s oldest continuously inhabited cities. An ancient tomb presumed to be that of Daniel is located in the area. [^c]: Esther 1:6 An Egyptian rock of feldspar crystals embedded in a dark red or purple groundmass used as flooring. [^d]: Esther 1:10 Eunuchs were the men who were placed in charge of the king’s harem, and for that reason had been castrated. [^e]: Esther 1:11 According to Jewish tradition Ahasuerus’ guests demanded that Vashti be naked, except for her royal turban to confirm that she was the queen and not just a servant-girl. She pleaded with Ahasuerus using several arguments, one of which was that if the guests found her beautiful, they would want to ravish her and kill him; and if not, her lack of beauty would disgrace him. [^f]: Esther 1:19 The intent may have been simply to confine Vashti to the king’s harem and put another wife on the throne. The ancient rabbis said, however, that when the king accepted the advice, he ordered that Vashti be beheaded and her head brought to him on a platter. [^g]: Esther 1:22 In recognition of the position of her husband a foreign-born wife was to speak his language.

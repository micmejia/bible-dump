# Esther 7

***
















###### 1 







So the king and Haman came to drink _wine_ with Esther the queen. 















###### 2 







And the king said to Esther on the second day also as they drank their wine, "What is your petition, Queen Esther? It shall be granted to you. And what is your request? Even to half of the kingdom, it shall be done." 















###### 3 







Then Queen Esther replied, "If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it pleases the king, let my life be spared as my petition, and my people [be spared] as my request; 















###### 4 







for we have been sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, killed and wiped out of existence. Now if we had only been sold as slaves, men and women, I would have remained silent, for our hardship would not be sufficient to burden the king [by even mentioning it]." 















###### 5 







Then King Ahasuerus (Xerxes) asked Queen Esther, "Who is he, and where is he, who dares to do such a thing?" 















###### 6 







Esther said, "An adversary and an enemy is Haman, this evil man." Then Haman became terrified before the king and queen. ## Haman Is Hanged 















###### 7 







Then in his fury, the king stood up from drinking wine _and went_ into the palace garden [to decide what he should do]; but Haman stayed to plead for his life from Queen Esther, for he saw that harm had been determined against him by the king. 















###### 8 







When the king returned from the palace garden to the place where they were drinking wine, Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was. Then the king said, "Will he even _attempt to_ assault the queen with me in the palace?" As the king spoke those words, the servants covered Haman's face [in preparation for execution]. 















###### 9 







Then Harbonah, one of the eunuchs serving the king said, "Now look, there are gallows fifty cubits (75 ft.) high standing at Haman's house, which Haman made for Mordecai, whose good warning saved the king." And the king said, "Hang him on it." 















###### 10 







So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the king's anger subsided. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: Exodus 15:4 Lit _Sea of Reeds_. [^c]: Exodus 15:12 Lit _earth_. [^d]: Exodus 15:23 The water may have been like that of the Dead Sea, which has such a high salt content that it is bitter, and the natural reaction when attempting to sample it is to spit it out immediately. [^e]: Exodus 15:25 God tests His people to see if they are learning from past experiences and growing in spiritual maturity. [^f]: Exodus 15:26 Heb _YHWH (Yahweh)-Ropheeka_.

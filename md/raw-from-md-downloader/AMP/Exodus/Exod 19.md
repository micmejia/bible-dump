# Exodus 19

***
















###### 1 







In the third month after the children of Israel had left the land of Egypt, the very same day, they came into the Wilderness of Sinai. 















###### 2 







When they moved out from Rephidim, they came to the Wilderness of Sinai and they camped there; Israel camped at the base of the mountain [of Sinai]. 















###### 3 







Moses went up to God [on the mountain], and the LORD called to him from the mountain, saying, "Say this to the house of Jacob and tell the Israelites: 















###### 4 







'You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I carried you on eagles' wings, and brought you to Myself. 















###### 5 







Now therefore, if you will in fact obey My voice and keep My covenant (agreement), then you shall be My own special possession _and_ treasure from among all peoples [of the world], for all the earth is Mine; 















###### 6 







and you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation [set apart for My purpose].' These are the words that you shall speak to the Israelites." 















###### 7 







So Moses called for the elders of the people, and told them all these words which the LORD commanded him. 















###### 8 







All the people answered together and said, "We will do everything that the LORD has spoken." And Moses reported the words of the people to the LORD. 















###### 9 







The LORD said to Moses, "Behold, I will come to you in a thick cloud, so that the people may hear when I speak with you and may believe _and_ trust in you forever." Then Moses repeated the words of the people to the LORD. 















###### 10 







The LORD also said to Moses, "Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow [that is, prepare them for My sacred purpose], and have them wash their clothes 















###### 11 







and be ready by the third day, because on the third day the LORD will come down on Mount Sinai [in the cloud] in the sight of all the people. 















###### 12 







You shall set barriers for the people all around [the mountain], saying, 'Beware that you do not go up on the mountain or touch its border; whoever touches the mountain must be put to death. 















###### 13 







No hand shall touch him [that is, no one shall try to save the guilty party], but the offender must be stoned or shot through [with arrows]; whether man or animal [that touches the mountain], he shall not live.' When the ram's horn sounds a long blast, they shall come up to the mountain." 















###### 14 







So Moses went down from the mountain to the people and sanctified them [for God's sacred purpose], and they washed their clothes. 















###### 15 







He said to the people, "Be prepared for the third day; do not [^a]be intimate with a woman." 















###### 16 







So it happened on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunder and flashes of lightning, and a thick cloud was on the mountain, and a very loud blast was sounded on a ram's horn, so that all the people who were in the camp trembled. 















###### 17 







Then Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God, and they stood _and_ presented themselves at the foot of the mountain. ## The LORD Visits Sinai 















###### 18 







Mount Sinai was wrapped in smoke because the LORD descended upon it in fire; its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain quaked violently. 















###### 19 







And it happened, as the blast of the ram's horn grew louder and louder, Moses spoke and God answered him with [a voice of] thunder. 















###### 20 







The LORD came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain; and the LORD called Moses to the top of the mountain, and he went up. 















###### 21 







Then the LORD spoke to Moses, "Go down, warn the people, so that they do not break through [the barriers around the mountain] to the LORD to see [Me], and many of them perish [as a result]. 















###### 22 







Also have the priests who approach the LORD consecrate (sanctify, set apart) themselves [for My sacred purpose], or else the LORD will break forth [in judgment] against them [and destroy them]." 















###### 23 







Moses said to the LORD, "The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai, because You warned us, saying, 'Set barriers around the mountain and consecrate it.'" 















###### 24 







Then the LORD said to him, "Go down and come up again, you and Aaron with you; but do not let the priests and the people break through [the barriers] to come up to the LORD, or He will break forth [in judgment] against them [and destroy them]." 















###### 25 







So Moses went down to the people and told them [again about God's warning]. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Exodus 21

***
















###### 1 







"Now these are the ordinances (laws) which you shall set before the Israelites: 















###### 2 







"If you purchase a Hebrew servant [because of his debt or poverty], he shall serve six years, and in the seventh [year] he shall leave as a free man, paying nothing. 















###### 3 







If he came [to you] alone, he shall leave alone; if he came married, then his wife shall leave with him. 















###### 4 







If his master gives him a wife, and she gives birth to sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall belong to her master, and he shall leave [your service] alone. 















###### 5 







But if the servant plainly says, 'I love my master, my wife and my children; I will not leave as a free man,' 















###### 6 







then his master shall bring him to God [that is, to the judges who act in God's name], then he shall bring him to the door or doorpost. And his master shall pierce his ear with an awl (strong needle); and he shall serve him for life. 















###### 7 







"If a man sells his daughter to be a female servant, she shall not go free [after six years] as male servants do. 















###### 8 







If she does not please her master who has chosen her for himself [as a wife], he shall let her be redeemed [by her family]. He does not have the authority to sell her to a foreign people, because he has been unfair to her. 















###### 9 







If her master chooses her [as a wife] for his son, he shall act toward her as if she were legally his daughter. 















###### 10 







If her master marries another wife, he may not reduce her food, her clothing, or her privilege as a wife. 















###### 11 







If he does not do these three things for her, then shall she leave free, without _payment of_ money. ## Personal Injuries 















###### 12 







"Whoever strikes a man so that he dies must be put to death. 















###### 13 







However, [^a]if he did not lie in wait [for him], but God allowed him to fall into his hand, then I will establish for you a [^b]place to which he may escape [for protection until duly tried]. 















###### 14 







But if a man acts intentionally against another and kills him by [design through] treachery, you are to take him from My altar [to which he may have fled for protection], so that he may be put to death. 















###### 15 







"Whoever strikes his father or his mother must be put to death. 















###### 16 







"Whoever kidnaps a man, whether he sells him or is found with him in his possession, must be put to death. 















###### 17 







"Whoever [^c]curses his father or his mother _or_ treats them contemptuously must be put to death. 















###### 18 







"If men quarrel and one strikes another with a stone or with his fist, and he does not die but is confined to bed, 















###### 19 







if he gets up and walks around leaning on his cane, then the one who struck him shall be left [physically] unpunished; he must only pay for his loss of time [at work], and the costs [of treatment and recuperation] until he is thoroughly healed. 















###### 20 







"If a man strikes his male or his female servant with a staff and the servant dies at his hand, he must be punished. 















###### 21 







If, however, the servant survives for a day or two, the offender shall not be punished, for the [injured] servant is his own property. 















###### 22 







"If men fight with each other and injure a pregnant woman so that she gives birth prematurely [and the baby lives], yet there is no _further_ injury, the one who hurt her must be punished with a fine [paid] to the woman's husband, as much as the judges decide. 















###### 23 







But if there is _any further_ injury, then you shall require [as a penalty] life for life, 















###### 24 







[^d]eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 















###### 25 







burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise. 















###### 26 







"If a man hits the eye of his male servant or female servant and it is destroyed, he must let the servant go free because of [the loss of] the eye. 















###### 27 







And if he knocks out the tooth of his male servant or female servant, he must let the servant go free because of [the loss of] the tooth. 















###### 28 







"If an ox gores a man or a woman to death, the ox must be stoned and its meat shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be cleared [of responsibility]. 















###### 29 







But if the ox has tried to gore on a previous occasion, and its owner has been warned, but has not kept it confined and it kills a man or a woman, the ox shall be stoned and its owner shall be put to death as well. 















###### 30 







If a ransom is demanded of him [in return for his life], then he shall give whatever is demanded for the redemption of his life. 















###### 31 







If the ox has gored another's son or daughter, he shall be dealt with according to this same rule. 















###### 32 







If the ox gores a male or a female servant, the owner shall give to the servant's master thirty shekels of silver [the purchase price for a slave], and the ox shall be stoned. 















###### 33 







"If a man leaves a pit open, or digs a pit and does not cover it, and an ox or a donkey falls into it, 















###### 34 







the owner of the pit shall make restitution; he shall give money to the animal's owner, but the dead [animal] shall be his. 















###### 35 







"If one man's ox injures another's so that it dies, then they shall sell the live ox and divide the proceeds equally; they shall also divide the dead ox [between them]. 















###### 36 







Or if it is known that the ox was previously in the habit of goring, and its owner has not kept it confined, he must make restitution of ox for ox, and the dead [animal] shall be his. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Exodus 23

***
















###### 1 







"You shall not give a false report; you shall not join hands with the wicked to be a malicious witness [promoting wrong and violence]. 















###### 2 







You shall not follow a crowd to do [something] evil, nor shall you testify at a trial _or_ in a dispute so as to side with a crowd in order to pervert _justice_; 















###### 3 







nor shall you favor _or_ be partial to a poor man in his dispute [simply because he is poor]. 















###### 4 







"If you meet your enemy's ox or his donkey wandering off, you must bring it back to him. 















###### 5 







If you see the donkey of one who hates you lying helpless under its load, you shall not leave the man to deal with it [alone]; you must help him release the animal [from its burden]. 















###### 6 







"You shall not pervert (bend) the justice due to your poor in his dispute. 















###### 7 







Keep far away from a false charge _or_ action, and do not condemn to death the innocent or the righteous, for I will not justify _and_ acquit the guilty. 















###### 8 







"You shall not accept a bribe, for a bribe blinds the clear-sighted and subverts the testimony _and_ the cause of the righteous. 















###### 9 







"You shall not oppress a stranger, for you know the soul [the feelings, thoughts, and concerns] of a stranger, for you were strangers in Egypt. ## The Sabbath and Land 















###### 10 







"You shall sow your land six years and harvest its yield, 















###### 11 







but the seventh year you shall let it rest and lie uncultivated, so that the poor among your people may eat [what the land grows naturally]; whatever they leave the animals of the field may eat. You shall do the same with your vineyard and olive grove. 















###### 12 







"Six days [each week] you shall do your work, but on the seventh day you shall stop [working] so that your ox and your donkey may settle down _and_ rest, and the son of your female servant, as well as your stranger, may be refreshed. 















###### 13 







Now concerning everything which I have said to you, be on your guard; do not mention the name of other gods [either in a blessing or in a curse]; do not let such speech be heard [coming] from your mouth. ## Three National Feasts 















###### 14 







"Three times a year you shall celebrate a feast [dedicated] to Me. 















###### 15 







You shall observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread; for seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the appointed time in the month of Abib, for in it you came out of Egypt. No one shall appear before Me empty-handed [but you shall bring sacrificial offerings]. 















###### 16 







Also [you shall observe] the Feast of Harvest (Weeks, Pentecost, or First Fruits), acknowledging the first fruits of your labor, of what you sow in the field. And [third] the Feast of Ingathering (Booths or Tabernacles) at the end of the year when you gather in [the fruit of] your labors from the field. 















###### 17 







Three times a year all your males shall appear before the [^a]Lord God. 















###### 18 







"You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with [^b]leavened bread; and the fat of My feast is not to be left overnight until morning. 















###### 19 







"You shall bring the choice first fruits of your ground into the house of the LORD your God. "You shall not [^c]boil a young goat in its mother's milk. ## Conquest of the Land 















###### 20 







"Behold, I am going to send an [^d]Angel before you to keep _and_ guard you on the way and to bring you to the place I have prepared. 















###### 21 







Be on your guard before Him, listen to _and_ obey His voice; do not be rebellious toward Him _or_ provoke Him, for He will not pardon your transgression, since My Name (authority) is in Him. 















###### 22 







But if you will indeed listen to _and_ truly obey His voice and do everything that I say, then I will be an enemy to your enemies and an adversary to your adversaries. 















###### 23 







When My Angel goes before you and brings you to [the land of] the Amorite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Canaanite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, I will reject them _and_ completely destroy them. 















###### 24 







You shall not bow down to worship their gods, nor serve them, nor do [anything] in accordance with their practices. You shall completely overthrow them and break down their [sacred] pillars _and_ images [of pagan worship]. 















###### 25 







You shall serve [only] the LORD your God, and He shall bless your bread and water. I will also remove sickness from among you. 















###### 26 







No one shall suffer miscarriage or be barren in your land; [^e]I will fulfill the number of your days. 















###### 27 







I will send My terror ahead of you, and I will throw into confusion all the people among whom you come, and I will make all your enemies turn their backs to you [in flight]. 















###### 28 







I will send hornets ahead of you which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite before you. 















###### 29 







I will not drive them out before you in a single year, so that the land does not become desolate [due to lack of attention] and the [wild] animals of the field do not become too numerous for you. 















###### 30 







I will drive them out before you little by little, until you have increased and are strong enough to take possession of the land. 















###### 31 







I will establish your borders from the Red Sea to the Sea of the Philistines (the Mediterranean), and from the wilderness to the River _Euphrates_; for I will hand over the residents of the land to you, and you shall drive them out before you. 















###### 32 







You shall not make a covenant with them or with their gods. 















###### 33 







They shall not live in your land, because they will make you sin against Me; for if you serve their gods, it is certain to be a trap for you [resulting in judgment]." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: Exodus 23:18 Because leaven is a kind of fungus, it became a symbol of corruption and sin. But in some contexts it had positive connotations (e.g. Lev 23:17; Matt 13:33). [^c]: Exodus 23:19 This may have been a pagan practice, perhaps a fertility rite. [^d]: Exodus 23:20 “Angel” has been capitalized here to reflect the likelihood that it is God appearing in a visible form (see note Gen 16:7). [^e]: Exodus 23:26 I.e. grant you long life.

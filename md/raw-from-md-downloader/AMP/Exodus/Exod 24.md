# Exodus 24

***
















###### 1 







Then God said to Moses, "Come up to the LORD, you and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu (Aaron's older sons), and seventy of Israel's elders, and you shall worship at a [safe] distance. 















###### 2 







Moses alone shall approach the LORD, but the others shall not come near, nor shall the people come up with him." 















###### 3 







Then Moses came and told the people everything that the LORD had said and all the ordinances. And all the people answered with one voice, "Everything the LORD has said we will do." 















###### 4 







Moses wrote down all the words of the LORD. Then he got up early in the morning, and built an altar [for worship] at the foot of the mountain with twelve pillars (memorial stones) representing the twelve tribes of Israel. 















###### 5 







Then he sent young Israelite men, and they offered burnt offerings and sacrificed young bulls as peace offerings to the LORD. 















###### 6 







Moses took half of the blood and put it in large basins, and [the other] half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar. 















###### 7 







Then he took the Book of the Covenant and read it aloud to the people; and they said, "Everything that the LORD has said we will do, and we will be obedient." 















###### 8 







So Moses took the blood [which had been placed in the large basins] and sprinkled it on the people, and said, "Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD has made with you in accordance with all these words." 















###### 9 







Then Moses, Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel went up [the mountainside], 















###### 10 







and they saw [a manifestation of] the God of Israel; and under His feet there appeared to be a pavement of sapphire, just as clear as the sky itself. 















###### 11 







Yet He did not stretch out His hand against the nobles of the Israelites; and they saw [the manifestation of the presence of] God, and ate and drank. 















###### 12 







Now the LORD said to Moses, "Come up to Me on the mountain and stay there, and I will give you the stone tablets with the law and the commandments which I have written for their instruction." 















###### 13 







So Moses [^a]arose with Joshua his attendant, and he went up to the mountain of God. 















###### 14 







And he said to the elders, "Wait here for us until we come back to you. Remember that Aaron and Hur are with you; whoever has a legal matter, let him go to them." 















###### 15 







Then Moses went up to the mountain, and the cloud covered the mountain. 















###### 16 







The glory _and_ brilliance of the LORD rested on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it for six days. On the seventh day God called to Moses from the midst of the cloud. 















###### 17 







In the sight of the Israelites the appearance of the glory _and_ brilliance of the LORD was like consuming fire on the top of the mountain. 















###### 18 







Moses entered the midst of the cloud and went up the mountain; and he was on the mountain forty days and forty nights. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

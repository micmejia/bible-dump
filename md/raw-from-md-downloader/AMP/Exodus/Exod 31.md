# Exodus 31

***
















###### 1 







Now the LORD said to Moses, 















###### 2 







"See, I have called by name Bezalel, son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah. 















###### 3 







I have filled him with the Spirit of God in wisdom _and_ skill, in understanding _and_ intelligence, in knowledge, and in all kinds of craftsmanship, 















###### 4 







to make artistic designs for work in gold, in silver, and in bronze, 















###### 5 







and in the cutting of stones for settings, and in the carving of wood, to work in all kinds of craftsmanship. 















###### 6 







And behold, I Myself have appointed with him Oholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; to all who are wise-hearted I have given the skill _and_ ability to make everything that I have commanded you: 















###### 7 







the Tent of Meeting, the ark of the Testimony, the mercy seat that is upon it, all the furnishings of the tent-- 















###### 8 







the table [for the bread] and its utensils, the pure _gold_ lampstand with all its utensils, the [golden] altar of incense, 















###### 9 







the [bronze] altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, the basin and its base-- 















###### 10 







the finely worked garments, the holy garments for Aaron the [high] priest and the garments for his sons to minister as priests, 















###### 11 







and the anointing oil and the sweet _and_ fragrant incense for the Holy Place. They are to make _them_ according to all that I have commanded you." ## The Sign of the Sabbath 















###### 12 







And the LORD said to Moses, 















###### 13 







"But as for you, say to the Israelites, 'You shall most certainly observe My Sabbaths, for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations, so that you may know [without any doubt] _and_ acknowledge that I am the LORD who sanctifies you _and_ sets you apart [for Myself]. 















###### 14 







Therefore, you shall keep the Sabbath, for it is holy to you. Everyone who profanes it must be put to death; for whoever does work on the Sabbath, that person (soul) shall be cut off from among his people [excluding him from the atonement made for them]. 















###### 15 







For six days work may be done, but the seventh is the Sabbath of complete rest, sacred to the LORD; whoever does work on the Sabbath day must be put to death. 















###### 16 







So the Israelites shall observe the Sabbath, to celebrate the Sabbath throughout their generations as a perpetual covenant.' 















###### 17 







It is a sign between Me and the Israelites forever; for in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day He ceased and was refreshed." 















###### 18 







When He had finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai, He gave Moses the two tablets of the Testimony, tablets of stone, written with the finger of God. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

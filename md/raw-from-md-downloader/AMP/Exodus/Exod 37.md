# Exodus 37

***
















###### 1 







Bezalel made the ark [of the covenant] of acacia wood--it was two and a half cubits long, and one and a half cubits wide, and one and a half cubits high. 















###### 2 







And he overlaid it with pure gold inside and out, and made a molding (border) of gold to go all around [the top of it]. 















###### 3 







He cast four rings of gold for it on its four feet, two rings on one side and two rings on the other side. 















###### 4 







He made carrying poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold. 















###### 5 







He put the carrying poles through the rings at the sides of the ark, to carry it. 















###### 6 







Bezalel made the mercy seat of pure gold; it was two and a half cubits long, and one and a half cubits wide. 















###### 7 







He made two cherubim of hammered gold; he made them at the two ends of the mercy seat, 















###### 8 







one cherub at one end and one cherub at the other end; he made the cherubim [of one piece] with the mercy seat at the two ends. 















###### 9 







The cherubim spread out their wings upward, covering _and_ protecting the mercy seat with their wings, with their faces toward each other; the faces of the cherubim were [looking downward] toward the mercy seat. 















###### 10 







Bezalel made the table [for the bread] of acacia wood; it was two cubits long, a cubit wide, and one and a half cubits high. 















###### 11 







He overlaid it with pure gold, and made a border of gold for it all around [its top]. 















###### 12 







He made a rim for it [just under the top] a hand width wide all around, and a border of gold around its rim. 















###### 13 







He cast four rings of gold for it and fastened the rings to the four corners that were at its four legs. 















###### 14 







Close by the rim were the rings, the holders for the poles [to pass through] to carry the table. 















###### 15 







Bezalel made the carrying poles of acacia wood to carry the table and overlaid them with gold. 















###### 16 







He made the utensils which were to be on the table, its dishes and its pans [for bread], its bowls and its jars for pouring drink offerings, of pure gold. 















###### 17 







Then he made the lampstand (menorah) of pure gold. He made the lampstand of hammered work, its base and its [center] shaft; its cups, its [^a]calyxes, and its flowers were _all of one piece_ with it. 















###### 18 







There were six branches coming out of the sides of the lampstand, three branches from one side of _the center shaft_ and three branches from the other side of it; 















###### 19 







three cups shaped like almond _blossoms_, a calyx and a flower in one branch, and three cups shaped like almond _blossoms_, a calyx and a flower in the opposite branch--so for the six branches coming out of _the center shaft of_ the lampstand. 















###### 20 







On _the center shaft of_ the lampstand there were four cups shaped like almond _blossoms_, with calyxes and flowers [one at the top]; 















###### 21 







and a calyx was under the _first_ pair of branches _coming_ out of it, and a calyx under the _second_ pair of branches, _coming_ out of it, and a calyx under the _third_ pair of branches _coming_ out of it, for the six branches coming out of the lampstand. 















###### 22 







Their calyxes and their branches were _of one piece_ with it; all of it was a single hammered work of pure gold. 















###### 23 







He made its seven lamps with its snuffers and its trays of pure gold. 















###### 24 







He made the lampstand and all its utensils from a talent of pure gold. 















###### 25 







Then Bezalel made the incense altar of acacia wood; its top was a cubit square and it was two cubits high; the horns were _of one piece_ with it. 















###### 26 







He overlaid it with pure gold, its top, its sides all around and its horns; he also made a rim of gold around it. 















###### 27 







He made two rings of gold for it under its rim, on its two opposite sides, as holders for the poles [to pass through] to carry it. 















###### 28 







He made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold. 















###### 29 







He also made the holy anointing oil and the pure, fragrant incense of spices, the work of a perfumer. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

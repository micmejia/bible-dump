# Exodus 38

***
















###### 1 







Then Bezalel made the altar of burnt offering of acacia wood; its top was square, five cubits long and five cubits wide, and three cubits high. 















###### 2 







And he made its horns (horn-shaped projections) on the four corners of it; the horns were _of one piece_ with it, and he overlaid it with bronze. 















###### 3 







He made all the utensils _and_ vessels of the altar [of burnt offering], the pots, shovels, basins [to catch the blood of the sacrificed animal], meat hooks and the firepans [to store live coals]. He made all its utensils of bronze. 















###### 4 







He made for the altar a grating of bronze mesh under its rim, extending halfway up it. 















###### 5 







He cast four rings for the four corners of the bronze grating as holders for the carrying poles. 















###### 6 







And he made the carrying poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with bronze. 















###### 7 







He put the poles through the rings on the sides of the altar, with which to carry it; he made it hollow with planks. 















###### 8 







Bezalel made the basin and its base of bronze from the mirrors of the attending women who served _and_ ministered at the doorway of the Tent of Meeting. 















###### 9 







Then he made the court: for the south side the curtains of the court were of fine twisted linen, a hundred cubits; 















###### 10 







their twenty support poles, and their twenty bronze sockets; the hooks of the support poles and their connecting rings were silver. 















###### 11 







And for the north side [of the court the curtains were also] a hundred cubits; their twenty support poles and their twenty bronze sockets; the hooks of the support poles and their connecting rings were silver. 















###### 12 







For the west side [of the court] there were curtains of fifty cubits with their ten support poles and their ten sockets; the hooks of the support poles and their connecting rings were silver. 















###### 13 







For the east side [the front of the courtyard, there were curtains of] fifty cubits. 















###### 14 







The curtains for one side _of the court gate were_ fifteen cubits, with their three support poles and their three sockets; 















###### 15 







and _the same_ for the other side [of the court gate]. Left and right of the court gate there were curtains of fifteen cubits; with their three support poles and their three sockets. 















###### 16 







All the curtains around the court were of fine twisted linen. 















###### 17 







The sockets for the support poles were _made of_ bronze, the hooks of the support poles and their connecting rings were _made of_ silver; and silver overlaid their tops. All the support poles of the court had silver connecting rings. 















###### 18 







The screen (curtain) for the gate of the courtyard [on the east side] was the work of an embroiderer, in blue, purple, and scarlet fabric, and fine twisted linen; it was twenty cubits long and five cubits high, corresponding to the curtains of the court. 















###### 19 







Their four support poles and their four sockets were bronze; their hooks were silver, and silver overlaid their tops and their connecting rings. 















###### 20 







All the pegs for the tabernacle and the court were bronze. ## The Cost of the Tabernacle 















###### 21 







This is the sum of the things for the tabernacle, the tabernacle of the Testimony, as counted according to the command of Moses, for the work of the Levites, under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest. 















###### 22 







Now Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made everything that the LORD commanded Moses. 















###### 23 







With him was Oholiab the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver and a skillful craftsman and an embroiderer in blue and in purple and in scarlet fabric, and in fine linen. 















###### 24 







All the gold that was used for the work, in all the building _and_ furnishing of the sanctuary, the gold from the wave offering, was twenty-nine talents and seven hundred and thirty shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary. 















###### 25 







The silver from those of the congregation who were assembled _and_ counted was 100 talents and 1,775 shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary; 















###### 26 







a beka for each man **(**that is, half a shekel according to the shekel of the sanctuary**)** for everyone who was counted, from twenty years old and upward, for 603,550 men. 















###### 27 







The hundred talents of silver were for casting the sockets of the sanctuary and the sockets of the veil (partition curtain); a hundred sockets for the hundred talents, a talent for a socket. 















###### 28 







Of the 1,775 _shekels_, he made hooks for the support poles and overlaid their tops and made connecting rings for them. 















###### 29 







The bronze of the wave offering was seventy talents and 2,400 shekels. 















###### 30 







With it Bezalel made the sockets for the doorway of the Tent of Meeting, and the bronze altar and its bronze grating, and all the utensils of the altar, 















###### 31 







and the sockets of the court all around and the sockets of the court gate, and all the pegs of the tabernacle and all the pegs around the court. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Exodus 6

***
















###### 1 







Then the LORD said to Moses, "Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh; for [^a]under compulsion he will [not only] let them go, but under compulsion he will drive them out of his land." 















###### 2 







Then God spoke further to Moses and said to him, "I am the LORD. 















###### 3 







I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob (Israel) as God Almighty [El Shaddai], but by My [^b]name, [^c]LORD, I did not make Myself known to them [in acts and great miracles]. 















###### 4 







I also established My covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land in which they lived as strangers (temporary residents, foreigners). 















###### 5 







And I have also heard the groaning of the sons of Israel, whom the Egyptians have enslaved, and I have [faithfully] remembered My covenant [with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob]. 















###### 6 







Therefore, say to the children of Israel, 'I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will free you from their bondage. I will redeem _and_ rescue you with an outstretched (vigorous, powerful) arm and with great acts of judgment [against Egypt]. 















###### 7 







Then I will take you for My people, and I will be your God; and you shall know that I am the LORD your God, who redeemed you _and_ brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. 















###### 8 







I will bring you to the land which I [^d]swore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (Israel); and I will give it to you as a possession. I am the LORD [you have the promise of My changeless omnipotence and faithfulness].'" 















###### 9 







Moses told this to the Israelites, but they did not listen to him because of their [^e]impatience _and_ despondency, and because of their forced labor. 















###### 10 







The LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 















###### 11 







"Go, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the children of Israel go out of his land." 















###### 12 







But Moses said to the LORD, "Look, [my own people] the Israelites have not listened to me; so how then will Pharaoh listen to me, for I am [^f]unskilled _and_ inept in speech?" 















###### 13 







Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, and gave them a command concerning the Israelites and Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the Israelites out of the land of Egypt. ## The Heads of Israel

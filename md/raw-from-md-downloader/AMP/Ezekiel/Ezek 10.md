# Ezekiel 10

***
















###### 1 







Then I looked, and behold, in the expanse (firmament) that was over the heads of the cherubim there appeared something [glorious and brilliant] above them looking like a [huge] sapphire stone, formed to resemble a throne. 















###### 2 







And the LORD spoke to the man (seventh angel) clothed in linen and said, "Go between the whirling wheels under the cherubim; fill your hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim and scatter them over the city." And he entered as I watched. 















###### 3 







Now the cherubim were standing on the right side of the temple when the man entered; and a cloud [the Shekinah glory of God] filled the inner courtyard. 















###### 4 







Then the glory _and_ brilliance of the LORD moved upward from the cherubim to [rest over] the threshold of the temple; and the temple was filled with the cloud and the courtyard was filled with the brightness of the Lord's glory. 















###### 5 







And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard [even] as far as the outer courtyard, like the voice of [^a]God Almighty when He speaks. 















###### 6 







It came about when He commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, "Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim," the man entered and stood beside a wheel. 















###### 7 







Then a cherub stretched out his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between [the four of] them, and took some [of it] and put it into the hands of the man clothed in linen, who took it and departed. 















###### 8 







Beneath their wings the cherubim seemed to have [something in] the form of a man's hand. 















###### 9 







Then I looked and behold, [there were] four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside one cherub and another wheel beside each other cherub; and the appearance of the wheels was like a sparkling Tarshish stone (beryl). 















###### 10 







As for their appearance, all four looked alike, as if one wheel were within another wheel. 















###### 11 







When they moved, they went in any of their four directions without turning as they went; but they followed in the direction which they faced, without turning as they went. 















###### 12 







Their whole body, their backs, their hands, their wings, and the wheels were full of eyes all around, even the wheels belonging to all four of them. 















###### 13 







Regarding the wheels [attached to them], I heard them called, "the whirling (rolling, revolving) wheels." 















###### 14 







And each one had four faces: the first face was the face of the [^b]cherub, the second the face of a man, the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle. 















###### 15 







Then the cherubim rose upward. They are the [same four] living beings [regarded as one] that I saw by the River Chebar [in Babylonia]. 















###### 16 







Now when the cherubim moved, the wheels would go beside them; and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to rise from the earth, the wheels would remain beside them. 















###### 17 







When the cherubim stood still, the wheels would stand still; and when they rose upward, the wheels would rise with them, for the spirit of the living beings was in these [wheels]. 















###### 18 







Then the [Shekinah] glory of the LORD departed from the threshold of the temple and rested over the cherubim. 















###### 19 







As I looked at them, the cherubim lifted up their wings and rose up from the earth, they departed with the wheels beside them; and they stood still at the entrance of the east gate of the house of the LORD, and the glory _and_ brilliance of the God of Israel hovered over them. 















###### 20 







These are the living beings that I saw beneath the God of Israel by the River Chebar; and I knew that they were cherubim. 















###### 21 







Each one had four faces and each one had four wings, and beneath their wings was the form of human hands. 















###### 22 







As for the likeness of their faces, they were the same faces whose appearance I had seen by the River Chebar. Each one went straight forward. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Ezekiel 13

***
















###### 1 







And the word of the LORD came to me saying, 















###### 2 







"Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who prophesy, and say to those who prophesy from their own inspiration, 'Hear the word of the LORD! 















###### 3 







Thus says the Lord God, "Woe (judgment is coming) to the foolish prophets who are following their own spirit [claiming to have seen things] but have [in fact] seen nothing. 















###### 4 







O Israel, your prophets have been like [^a]foxes among the ruins. 















###### 5 







You have not gone up into the gaps _or_ breaches, nor built the wall around the house of Israel that it might stand in the battle on the day of the LORD. 















###### 6 







They have seen falsehood and lying divination, saying, 'The LORD says,' but the LORD has not sent them. Yet they hope _and_ make men to hope for the confirmation of their word. 















###### 7 







Did you not see (make up) a false vision and speak a lying divination when you said, 'The LORD declares,' but it is not I who have spoken?"'" 















###### 8 







Therefore, thus says the Lord God, "Because you have spoken empty _and_ delusive words and have seen lies, therefore behold, I am against you," says the Lord God. 















###### 9 







"So My hand will be against the [counterfeit] prophets who see (make up) empty _and_ delusive visions and who give lying prophecies. They will have no place in the [secret] council of My people, nor will they be recorded in the register of the house of Israel, nor will they enter into the land of Israel, that you may know [without any doubt] that I am the Lord God. 















###### 10 







It is definitely because they have seduced My people, saying, 'Peace,' when there is no peace, and because when one builds a [flimsy] wall, behold, these [lying] prophets plaster it over with whitewash; 















###### 11 







so tell those who plaster it with whitewash, that it will fall! A flooding rain [of judgment] will come, and you, O [great] hailstones, will fall; and a violent wind will tear the wall apart. 















###### 12 







Behold, when the wall has fallen, will you not be asked, 'Where is the coating with which you [prophets] plastered it?'" 















###### 13 







Therefore, thus says the Lord God, "I will make a violent wind break out in My wrath, and there will be in My anger an overwhelming rain and great hailstones to destroy [that wall] in wrath. 















###### 14 







So I will tear down the wall which you have plastered with whitewash and bring it down to the ground, so that its foundations will be exposed; when it falls, you will perish in its midst. And you shall know _and_ understand fully that I am the LORD. 















###### 15 







Thus I will expend My wrath on the wall and on those who have plastered it with whitewash and I will say to you, 'The wall is gone and its plasterers are gone, 















###### 16 







_along with_ the [false] prophets of Israel who prophesy [deceitfully] to Jerusalem, and who see [false] visions of peace for her when there is no peace,' says the Lord God. 















###### 17 







"Now you, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people who are prophesying out of [the wishful thinking of] their own mind (inspiration). Prophesy against them 















###### 18 







and say, 'Thus says the Lord God, "Woe to the women who fasten _magic_ (protective) charms on all wrists and make veils for the heads of those of every stature to capture [human] lives! Will you capture the lives of My people but keep your own? 















###### 19 







You have profaned Me among My people [in payment] for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, killing people who should not die and giving [a guarantee of] life to those who should not live, because of your lies to My people who pay attention to lies."'" 















###### 20 







Therefore, thus says the Lord God, "Behold, I am against your _magic_ bands [and veils] by which you hunt [human] lives as birds and I will tear them from your arms; and I will let the lives you hunt go free, even those lives whom you hunt as birds. 















###### 21 







I will also tear off your [pagan] veils and rescue My people from your hands, and they will no longer be in your grip to be hunted _and_ trapped. Then you will know [without any doubt] that I am the LORD. 















###### 22 







Because you disheartened the righteous with falsehood when I did not cause him grief, but have encouraged the wicked not to turn from his wicked way and preserve his life, 















###### 23 







therefore, you women will no longer see false visions or practice divinations, and I will rescue My people from your hand. Then you will know [without any doubt] that I am the LORD." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Ezekiel 19

***
















###### 1 







"As for you, take up a dirge (funeral poem to be sung) for the princes of Israel 















###### 2 







and say, 'What was your mother [Jerusalem and Judah]? A lioness among lions! She lay down among young lions, She reared her cubs. 















###### 3 







'When she [the royal mother-city] brought up [Jehoahaz] one of her cubs, He became a [young] lion, And he learned to catch _and_ tear the prey; He devoured men. 















###### 4 







'The nations heard about him; He was captured in their pit, And they brought him with hooks To the land of Egypt. 















###### 5 







'When she saw, as she waited, That her hope was lost, She took [^a]another of her cubs And made him a young lion. 















###### 6 







'And he moved among the lions; He became a young lion, He learned to tear the prey; He devoured men. 















###### 7 







'He destroyed their palaces And he flattened their cities; And the land and all who were in it were appalled By the sound of his roaring. 















###### 8 







'Then the nations set against him (the king) On every side from the provinces, And they spread their net over him; He was captured in their pit. 















###### 9 







'They put him in a cage with hooks _and_ chains And brought him to the king of Babylon; They brought him in hunting nets So that his voice would be heard no more On the mountains of Israel. 















###### 10 







'Your mother [Jerusalem] was like a vine in your [^b]vineyard, Planted by the waters; It was fruitful and full of branches Because of abundant water. 















###### 11 







'And it had strong branches for the scepters of rulers, And its height was raised above the thick branches _and_ into the clouds So that it was seen [easily] in its height with the mass of its branches. 















###### 12 







'But the vine was uprooted in [godly] wrath [by His representative] And it was thrown down to the ground; The east wind dried up its fruit. Its strong branch was broken off So that it withered; The fire [of God's judgment] consumed it. 















###### 13 







'And now it is transplanted in the wilderness, In a dry and thirsty land [of Babylon]. 















###### 14 







'And the fire [of Zedekiah's rebellion] has gone out from its branch; It has consumed the vine's shoots and fruit, So that it has in it no [longer a] strong branch As a scepter to rule.'" This is a dirge (funeral poem to be sung), and has become a dirge. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Ezekiel 2

***
















###### 1 







Then He said to me, "Son of man, stand on your feet and I will speak to you." 















###### 2 







Then as He spoke to me the Spirit entered me and set me on my feet; and I heard Him speaking to me. 















###### 3 







And He said to me, "I am sending you, son of man, to the children of Israel, to a rebellious people [in both the north and the south] that have rebelled against Me; they and their fathers have sinned _and_ revolted against Me to this very day. 















###### 4 







I am sending you to them who are stubborn and obstinate children, and you shall say to them, 'Thus says the Lord [^a]God.' 















###### 5 







As for them, whether they listen or refuse [to listen]--for they are a rebellious house--yet they will know _and_ be fully aware of the fact that there has been a prophet among them. 















###### 6 







And you, son of man, neither fear them nor fear their words; though briars and thorns are all around you and you sit among scorpions, neither fear their words nor be dismayed at their presence, for they are a rebellious house. 















###### 7 







But you shall speak My words to them whether they will listen or refuse [to listen], for they are [most] rebellious. 















###### 8 







"As for you, son of man, listen to what I say to you; do not be rebellious like that rebellious house; open your mouth and eat what I am giving you." 















###### 9 







Then I looked, and I saw a hand stretched out toward me; and behold, a scroll of a book was in it. 















###### 10 







And He spread it before me, and it was written on the front and on the back, and written on it were [words of] lamentation (funeral songs) and mourning and woe. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

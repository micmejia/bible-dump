# Ezekiel 25

***
















###### 1 







The word of the LORD came to me again, saying, 















###### 2 







"Son of man, set your face toward the [^a]Ammonites and prophesy against them. 















###### 3 







And say to the Ammonites, 'Hear the word of the Lord God, for thus says the Lord God, "Because you said, 'Aha!' against My sanctuary when it was profaned and against the land of Israel when it was made desolate and against the house of Judah when they went into exile, 















###### 4 







therefore, behold, I am going to give you to the people of the East as a possession, and they will set their encampments among you and make their dwellings among you; they will eat your fruit and drink your milk. 















###### 5 







I will make Rabbah [your chief city] a pasture for camels and [the cities of] the Ammonites a resting place for flocks [of sheep]. And you will know [without any doubt] that I am the LORD." 















###### 6 







For thus says the Lord God, "Because you have clapped your hands and stamped your feet and rejoiced with all the contempt, _and_ malice, _and_ spite of your soul against the land of Israel, 















###### 7 







therefore, behold, I have stretched out My hand against you and will hand you over as prey _and_ spoil to the nations. And I will cut you off from the peoples and will cause you to perish from the countries; I will destroy you. Then you shall know [without any doubt] that I am the LORD." ## Moab 















###### 8 







'Thus says the Lord God, "Because [^b]Moab and Seir (Edom) say, 'Behold, the house of Judah is like all the [pagan] nations,' 















###### 9 







therefore, behold, I will deprive the flank of Moab of its cities which are on its frontiers, the glory of the land, Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon and Kiriathaim. 















###### 10 







I will give it, along with the children of Ammon, to the people of the East as a possession, so that the children of Ammon will not be remembered among the nations [any longer]. 















###### 11 







Thus I will execute judgment _and_ punishment on Moab, and they will know [without any doubt] that I am the LORD." ## Edom 















###### 12 







'Thus says the Lord God, "Because [^c]Edom has acted against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and has greatly offended _and_ has incurred grievous guilt by taking revenge on them," 















###### 13 







therefore thus says the Lord God, "I will also stretch out My hand against Edom and I will cut off _and_ destroy man and beast. I will make it desolate; from Teman even to Dedan they will fall by the sword. 















###### 14 







I will take My vengeance on Edom by the hand of My people Israel. Therefore, they will act in Edom in accordance with My anger and My wrath, and they will know _and_ experience My vengeance," says the Lord God. ## Philistia 















###### 15 







'Thus says the Lord God, "Because the [^d]Philistines have acted revengefully and have taken vengeance [contemptuously] with malice in their hearts to destroy with everlasting hostility _and_ hatred," 















###### 16 







therefore thus says the Lord God, "Behold, I will stretch out My hand against the Philistines, and I will cut off the [^e]Cherethites and destroy the remnant of the seacoast. 















###### 17 







I will execute great vengeance on them with wrathful rebukes _and_ chastisements and they will know [without any doubt] that I am the LORD when I lay My vengeance on them."'" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

They worshiped Molech. [^b]: Ezekiel 25:8 These people were descendants of Lot and his elder surviving daughter. In general, they were far more civilized and peaceful than the Ammonites. [^c]: Ezekiel 25:12 These people were descendants of Esau (later called Edom), the elder twin brother of Jacob (later called Israel). They settled south of the Dead Sea, southwest of Moab and east of Arabah. [^d]: Ezekiel 25:15 The name of this coastal people was derived from Philistia, the country bordering the Mediterranean where they settled. It is believed that they were originally from the island of Crete, home of the Minoan civilization. [^e]: Ezekiel 25:16 Probably another name for the Philistines, or a reference to another closely related group from Crete also living in Philistia.

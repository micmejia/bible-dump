The ships of Tarshish were the caravans for your merchandise, And you [Tyre] were replenished and very glorious [heavily laden with an imposing fleet] In the heart of the seas. 















###### 26 







"Your rowers have brought you Into great _and_ deep waters; The east wind has broken _and_ shipwrecked you In the heart of the seas. 















###### 27 







"Your riches, your wares, your merchandise Your oarsmen and your pilots, Your caulkers, your dealers in merchandise, And all your men of war who are with you, With all your company that is in your midst, Will sink in the heart of the seas On the day of your ruin.

###### 36

You will cease to be [^f]forever.'"'" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: Ezekiel 27:9 A city north of Sidon. [^c]: Ezekiel 27:15 The first Dedanites to settle in Arabia may have sailed to Arabia from the island of Rhodes. [^d]: Ezekiel 27:16 The people of the kingdom of Aram were descendants of Aram, the son of Shem, son of Noah (Gen 10:22, 23). The territory of the Arameans also included areas later identified as Syria and Mesopotamia. [^e]: Ezekiel 27:18 The capital city of Aram. [^f]: Ezekiel 27:36 As late as the thirteenth century a.d. the grandeur of the ancient city of Tyre was still visible. As time passed a large part of the western section of “the island” became covered by the sea, and early travelers told of seeing “houses, towers, and streets far down in the deep.” The site gradually disappeared; however, sporadic excavations (subject to the political climate) began in 1947, and many sections of the ancient city have been uncovered. Tyre is located about 50 miles south of Beirut.

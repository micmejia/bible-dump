# Ezekiel 28

***
















###### 1 







The word of the LORD came again to me, saying, 















###### 2 







"Son of man, say to the prince of Tyre, 'Thus says the Lord God, "Because your heart is lifted up And you have said _and_ thought, 'I am a god, I sit in the seat of the gods In the heart of the seas'; Yet you are [only] a man [weak, feeble, made of earth] and not God, Though you [imagine yourself to be more than mortal and] think your mind is as [wise as] the mind of God-- 















###### 3 







Behold, you are [imagining yourself] wiser than Daniel; There is no secret [you think] that is hidden from you; 















###### 4 







With your [own] wisdom and with your [own] understanding You have acquired your riches _and_ power And have brought gold and silver into your treasuries; 















###### 5 







By your great wisdom and by your trade You have increased your riches _and_ power, And your heart is proud _and_ arrogant because of your wealth; 















###### 6 







Therefore thus says the Lord God, 'Because you have imagined your mind [to be] Like the mind of God [having thoughts and plans like God Himself], 















###### 7 







Therefore, behold, I will bring strangers (Babylonians) upon you, The most ruthless _and_ violent of the nations. And they will draw their swords Against the beauty of your wisdom [O Tyre] And defile your splendor. 















###### 8 







'They will bring you down to the pit [of destruction], And you will die the death of all those who die In the heart of the seas. 















###### 9 







'Will you still say, "I am a god," In the presence of him who kills you? But you are [only] a man [made of earth] and not God, In the hands of those who wound _and_ profane you. 















###### 10 







'You will die the death of the uncircumcised [barbarian] By the hand of strangers, For I have spoken!' says the Lord God."'" 















###### 11 







Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 















###### 12 







"Son of man, take up a dirge (funeral poem to be sung) for the king of Tyre and say to him, 'Thus says the Lord God, "You had the full measure of perfection _and_ the finishing touch [of completeness], Full of wisdom and perfect in beauty. 















###### 13 







"You were in [^a]Eden, the garden of God; Every precious stone was your covering: The ruby, the topaz, and the diamond; The beryl, the onyx, and the jasper; The lapis lazuli, the turquoise, and the emerald; And the gold, the workmanship of your [^b]settings and your sockets, Was in you. They were prepared On the day that you were created. 















###### 14 







"You were the anointed cherub who covers _and_ protects, And I placed you there. You were on the holy mountain of God; You walked in the midst of the stones of fire [sparkling jewels]. 















###### 15 







"You were blameless in your ways From the day you were created Until unrighteousness _and_ evil were found in you. 















###### 16 







"Through the abundance of your commerce You were internally filled with lawlessness _and_ violence, And you sinned; Therefore I have cast you out as a profane _and_ unholy thing From the mountain of God. And I have destroyed you, O covering cherub, From the midst of the stones of fire. 















###### 17 







"Your heart was proud _and_ arrogant because of your beauty; You destroyed your wisdom for the sake of your splendor. I cast you to the ground; I lay you before kings, That they might look at you. 















###### 18 







"You profaned your sanctuaries By the great quantity of your sins _and_ the enormity of your guilt, By the unrighteousness of your trade. Therefore I have brought forth a fire from your midst; It has consumed you, And I have reduced you to ashes on the earth In the sight of all who look at you. 















###### 19 







"All the peoples (nations) who knew you Are appalled at you; You have come to a horrible _and_ terrifying end And will forever cease to be."'" ## Judgment of Sidon 















###### 20 







Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 















###### 21 







"Son of man, set your face toward Sidon, and prophesy against her 















###### 22 







and say, 'Thus says the Lord God, "Behold, I am against you, O Sidon, And I will show My glory _and_ be glorified in your midst. Then they will know [by personal experience] that I am the LORD when I bring judgment _and_ punishment on her, And I will manifest My holiness in her. 















###### 23 







"For I will send virulent disease to her And blood into her streets, And the wounded will fall in her midst By the sword upon her from every side, And they shall know [without any doubt] that I am the LORD. 















###### 24 







And there will no longer be a briar or a painful thorn to prick the house of Israel from all those around them who treated them with contempt; then they will know [with clarity] that I am the Lord God." ## Israel Regathered 















###### 25 







'Thus says the Lord God, "When I gather the house of Israel from the nations among whom they are scattered, and I manifest my Holiness in them in the sight of the nations, then they will live in their own land which I gave to My servant Jacob. 















###### 26 







They shall live in it securely; and they will build houses, plant vineyards and live securely when I execute judgment on all those around them who despise them. Then they will know [with clarity and confidence] that I am the LORD their God."'" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

Here may be seen also a foreshadowing of “the beast” who is to attribute to himself divine rights in the time of the end (Dan 7:8-28; 2 Thess 2:1-12; Rev 13; 19:20). [^b]: Ezekiel 28:13 Or _tambourines_.

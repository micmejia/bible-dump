# Ezekiel 29

***
















###### 1 







In the tenth year [of the captivity of King Jehoiachin by the king of Babylon], in the tenth _month_, on the twelfth of the month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 















###### 2 







"Son of man, set your face toward Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him and against all Egypt. 















###### 3 







Speak and say, 'Thus says the Lord God, "Behold, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, The great monster that lies in the midst of his rivers, [Boastfully] declaring, 'My Nile is my own, and I have made it for myself.' 















###### 4 







"I will put hooks in your jaws And [I will] make the fish of your rivers stick to your scales. And I will pull you up from the midst of your rivers, And all the fish of your rivers will stick to your scales. 















###### 5 







"I will abandon you to the wilderness, you and all the fish of your rivers; You will fall on the open field; and you will not be gathered up or buried. I have given you as food to the [wild] animals of the earth and the birds of the sky. 















###### 6 







"And all the inhabitants of Egypt will know [without any doubt] that I am the LORD, Because they have been [only] a staff made of [fragile] reeds to the house of Israel. 















###### 7 







"When they (Israel) grasped you (Egypt) by the hand, You broke and tore apart their hands; When they leaned on you, You broke and strained their backs." 















###### 8 







'Therefore thus says the Lord God, "Behold, I am going to bring a sword on you and cut off (destroy) both man and animal, 















###### 9 







and the land of Egypt will be a desolation and a wasteland. And they will know [without any doubt] that I am the LORD. "Because you said, 'The Nile is mine and I have made it,' 















###### 10 







behold (hear this), therefore, I am against you and against your rivers (the Nile, its tributaries), and I will make the land of Egypt a complete waste and a desolation, from [northern] Migdol to [southern] [^a]Syene, even as far as the border of Ethiopia (Cush). 















###### 11 







No man's foot will pass through it, no animal's foot will pass through it, and it will not be inhabited for forty years. 















###### 12 







So I will make the land of Egypt a desolation [plundered and ruined] among desolated lands; and her cities, among cities that are laid waste, will be desolate forty years. I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and [I will] disperse them through the lands." 















###### 13 







'For thus says the Lord God, "At the end of forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the nations among whom they were scattered. 















###### 14 







I will reverse the fortunes of Egypt [as I will that of Israel] and cause them to return to the land of Pathros, the land of their origin, and there they will be a lowly kingdom. 















###### 15 







It will be the lowliest of the kingdoms, and it will [^b]never again exalt itself above the nations; I will diminish the Egyptians so they will never again rule over the nations. 















###### 16 







And Egypt will never again have the confidence of the house of Israel; their wickedness will be remembered whenever Israel looks toward them [for help]. Then they will know [without any doubt] that I am the Lord God."'" 















###### 17 







In the twenty-seventh year [after King Jehoiachin was taken to Babylon], in the first _month_, on the first of the month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 















###### 18 







"Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made his army [^c]work hard [at My command] against Tyre; every [soldier's] head became [^d]bald and every shoulder was worn _and_ peeled [from carrying loads of dirt and stones for siege works]. Yet he had no wages from Tyre [in proportion to the time and labor expended during the siege], either for himself or his army, for the work that he had done against it [for Me]." 















###### 19 







Therefore thus says the Lord God, "Behold, I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. And he will carry off her wealth and capture her spoil and seize her plunder; and it shall be the wages for his army. 















###### 20 







I have given him the land of Egypt for the hard work which he did [against Tyre], because they did it for Me," says the Lord God. 















###### 21 







"In that day I will make a horn sprout for the house of Israel, and I will open your mouth among them, and they will know [without any doubt] that I am the LORD [when I renew their strength]." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Ezekiel 30

***
















###### 1 







The word of the LORD came again to me, saying, 















###### 2 







"Son of man, prophesy and say, 'Thus says the Lord God, "Wail, 'Alas for the day!' 















###### 3 







"For the day is near, Even the day of the LORD is near, It will be a cloudy day; A time _of doom_ for the nations. 















###### 4 







"A sword will come upon Egypt, And anguish _and_ trembling will be in Ethiopia (Cush), When the slain fall in Egypt And they [of Babylon] carry away her great mass of people _and_ her riches And her foundations are torn down. 















###### 5 







Ethiopia (Cush), Put, Lud, all [^a]Arabia, Libya (Cub) and the people of the land of the covenant [the Jews who had taken refuge in Egypt] will fall with the Egyptians by the sword." 















###### 6 







'Thus says the LORD, "Those who uphold _and_ support Egypt will fall And the pride of her power will come down; From Migdol [in the north] to Syene [in the south] They will fall within her by the sword," Says the Lord God. 















###### 7 







"And they will be desolate In the midst of countries that are desolated; And her cities will be Among cities that are devastated [by plunder and slavery]. 















###### 8 







"And they will know [without any doubt] that I am the LORD, When I have set a fire in Egypt And all her helpers are shattered _and_ destroyed. 















###### 9 







On that day [swift] messengers will go from Me in ships to frighten the careless _and_ unsuspecting Ethiopians, and there will be anguish _and_ trembling in them as in the day of [judgment for] Egypt; for behold, it is coming!" 















###### 10 







'Thus says the Lord God, "I will also make the great people of Egypt cease By the hand of [^b]Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. 















###### 11 







"He and his people with him, The most violent _and_ ruthless of the nations, Will be brought in to destroy the land, And they will draw their swords against Egypt And fill the land with the slain. 















###### 12 







"And I will make the rivers [of the Nile delta] dry And sell the land into the hands of evil men; I will make the land desolate And all that is in it, By the hand of strangers. I the LORD have spoken." 















###### 13 







'Thus says the Lord God, "I will also destroy the idols And I will put an end to the images in Memphis; There will no longer be a prince of the land of Egypt. And I will put fear in the land of Egypt. 















###### 14 







"I will make Pathros desolate, Set fire to Zoan And execute judgments _and_ punishments on Thebes. 















###### 15 







"I will pour out My wrath on Pelusium, The stronghold of Egypt, And I will cut off (destroy) the population of Thebes. 















###### 16 







"I will set fire to Egypt; Pelusium will writhe in [great] anguish, Thebes shall be torn open And Memphis shall be in daily distress. 















###### 17 







"The young men of On (Aven) and of Pi-beseth Will fall by the sword, And the women [and children] will go into captivity. 















###### 18 







"In Tehaphnehes the day will be dark When I break the yoke bars _and_ dominion of Egypt there. Then the pride of her power will come to an end; A cloud [of disasters] will cover her, And her daughters will go into captivity. 















###### 19 







"In this way I will bring judgment _and_ punishment on Egypt. Then they shall know [without any doubt] that I am the LORD."'" ## Victory for Babylon 















###### 20 







In the eleventh year [after King Jehoiachin was taken to Babylon], in the first _month_, on the seventh of the month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 















###### 21 







"Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and behold, it has not been bound up to heal or wrapped with a bandage, so that it may be strong to hold _and_ wield the sword. 















###### 22 







Therefore thus says the Lord God, 'Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt and will break his arms, both the strong one and the broken, and I will make the sword fall from his hand. 















###### 23 







I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and will disperse them throughout the lands. 















###### 24 







I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon and put My sword in his hand; but I will break Pharaoh's arms and he will groan before him (Nebuchadnezzar) with the groanings of a [mortally] wounded man. 















###### 25 







But I will strengthen _and_ hold up the arms of the king of Babylon and the arms of Pharaoh will fall down. Then the people [of Egypt] will know that I am the LORD, when I put My sword into the hand of the king of Babylon and he stretches it out against the land of Egypt. 















###### 26 







When I scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them through the lands, then they will know [without any doubt] that I am the LORD.'" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

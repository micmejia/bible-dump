# Ezekiel 42

***
















###### 1 







Then he (the angel) brought me out into the outer courtyard, toward the north; and he led me to the [attached] chamber which was opposite the separate area and opposite the building to the north. 















###### 2 







Along the length, one hundred cubits, was the north door; and the width was fifty cubits. 















###### 3 







Opposite the twenty _cubits_ which belonged to the inner courtyard, and opposite the pavement which belonged to the outer courtyard, was gallery (balcony) corresponding to gallery in three stories. 















###### 4 







In front of the [attached] chambers was an inner walkway ten cubits wide [^a]and one _hundred_ cubits long; and their entrances were on the north. 















###### 5 







Now the upper chambers were smaller because the galleries took away more _space_ from them than from the chambers on the lower and middle stories of the building; 















###### 6 







for they were in three stories and did not have pillars like the pillars of the [outer] courtyards; therefore _the upper chambers_ were [^b]set back from the ground more than the lower and the middle ones. 















###### 7 







And the outer wall, by the side of the chambers, toward the outer courtyard facing the chambers, was fifty cubits long. 















###### 8 







For the length of the chambers which were in the outer courtyard was fifty cubits, [^c]while _the length of_ those facing the temple was a hundred cubits. 















###### 9 







Below these chambers was the entrance on the east side, as one enters them from the outer courtyard. 















###### 10 







In the width of the wall of the courtyard toward the east, facing the separate area and facing the building, were chambers; 















###### 11 







and a passage in front of them was like the appearance of the [attached] chambers on the north, _and_ they had the same length and width, and all their exits were like both their [^d]arrangements and their entrances. 















###### 12 







And like the entrances of the chambers that were toward the south there was an entrance at the head of the walkway, the walkway in front of the [^e]dividing wall toward the east, as one enters them. 















###### 13 







Then he (the angel) said to me, "The north chambers and the south chambers, which are opposite the separate area, are the holy chambers where the priests who are close to the LORD shall eat the most holy _offerings_. There they shall place the most holy things--the grain offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering--for the place is holy. 















###### 14 







When the priests enter [the Holy Place], they shall not go out from the sanctuary into the outer court [^f]unless they lay there their garments in which they minister, for these are holy (set apart). They shall put on other garments before they approach that which is for the people." 















###### 15 







Now when he had finished measuring the inner temple, he brought me out toward the gate which faced east and measured the outer area all around. 















###### 16 







He measured the east side with the measuring [^g]rod, five hundred rods by the measuring rod. 















###### 17 







He measured the north side, five hundred rods by the measuring rod. 















###### 18 







He measured the south side, five hundred rods by the measuring rod. 















###### 19 







He turned about to the west side and measured five hundred rods by the measuring rod. 















###### 20 







He measured it on the four sides; it had a wall all around, the length five hundred and the width five hundred, to make a separation between that which was holy [the temple proper] and that which was common [the outer area]. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

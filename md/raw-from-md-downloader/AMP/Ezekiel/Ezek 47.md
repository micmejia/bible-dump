# Ezekiel 47

***
















###### 1 







Then he [my guide] brought me back to the door of the house [the temple of the LORD]; and behold, water was flowing from under the threshold of the house (temple) toward the east, for the front of the temple was facing east. And the water was flowing down from under, from the right side of the house, from south of the altar. 















###### 2 







Then he brought me out by way of the north gate and led me around on the outside to the outer gate by the way of _the gate_ that faces east. And behold, water was spurting out from the south side [of the gate]. 















###### 3 







When the man went out toward the east with a measuring line in his hand, he measured a thousand cubits, and he led me through the water, water that was ankle-deep. 















###### 4 







Again he measured a thousand [cubits] and led me through the water, water that was knee-deep. Again he measured a thousand [cubits] and led me through _the water_, water _reaching_ the hips. 















###### 5 







Again he measured a thousand [cubits]; _and it was_ a river that I could not pass through, for the water had risen, _enough_ water to swim in, a river that could not be crossed [by wading]. 















###### 6 







And he said to me, "Son of man, have you seen this?" Then he brought me back to the bank of the river. 















###### 7 







Now when I had returned, behold, on the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other. 















###### 8 







Then he said to me, "These waters go out toward the eastern region and go down into the Arabah (the Jordan Valley); then they go toward the sea, being made to flow into the sea, and the waters _of the Dead Sea_ shall be healed _and_ become fresh. 















###### 9 







It will come about that every living creature which swarms in every place where the river goes, will live. And there will be a very great number of fish, because these waters go there so that the waters of the sea are healed _and_ become fresh; so everything will live wherever the river goes. 















###### 10 







And it will come about that fishermen will stand beside it [at the banks of the Dead Sea]; from Engedi to Eneglaim there will be dry places to spread nets. Their fish will be of very many kinds, like the fish of the Great [Mediterranean] Sea. 















###### 11 







But its swamps and marshes will not become fresh [and wholesome for animal life]; they will [as the river subsides] be left encrusted with salt. 















###### 12 







By the river on its bank, on one side and on the other, will grow all _kinds of_ trees for food. Their leaves will not wither and their fruit will not fail. They shall bear every month because their water flows from the sanctuary, and their fruit will be for food and their leaves for healing." ## Boundaries and Division of the Land 















###### 13 







Thus says the Lord God, "This _shall be_ the boundary by which you shall divide the land as an inheritance among the twelve tribes of Israel; Joseph _shall have_ two portions. 















###### 14 







You shall divide it as an inheritance, each one equally with the other. I lifted up My hand _and_ swore to give it to your fathers, and this land shall fall to you as an inheritance. 















###### 15 







"And this shall be the boundary of the land on the north side: from the Great [Mediterranean] Sea by way of Hethlon to the entrance of Zedad, 















###### 16 







Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; [as far as] Hazer-hatticon, which is on the border of Hauran. 















###### 17 







So the boundary will extend from the [Mediterranean] Sea to Hazar-enan at the border of Damascus, and on the north, northward, is the border of Hamath. This is the north side. 















###### 18 







"The east side, from between Hauran, Damascus, Gilead, and the land of Israel, _shall be_ the Jordan; from the _north_ border to the eastern sea you shall measure. This is the east side. 















###### 19 







"The south side, southward, from Tamar [near the Dead Sea] _shall extend_ as far as the waters of Meribath-kadesh, to the Brook of Egypt and to the Great [Mediterranean] Sea. This is the south side toward the south. 















###### 20 







"The west side _shall be_ the Great [Mediterranean] Sea, from the _south_ border to a point opposite Lebo-hamath [north of Mount Hermon]. This is the west side. 















###### 21 







"So you shall divide this land among yourselves according to the tribes of Israel. 















###### 22 







You shall divide it by lot as an inheritance among yourselves and among the foreigners who stay among you, who give birth to sons among you. They shall be to you as the native-born [in the country] among the children (descendants) of Israel; they shall be allotted an inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel. 















###### 23 







In whatever tribe the foreigner resides, there shall you give him his inheritance," says the Lord God. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

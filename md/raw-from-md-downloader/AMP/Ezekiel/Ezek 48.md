"And beside the border of Judah, from the east side to the west side, shall be the allotment _and_ contribution of land which you shall set apart _and_ offer, 25,000 _cubits_ in width, and in length like one of the [tribal] portions, from the east side to the west side; and the sanctuary shall be in the midst of it. 















###### 9 







The allotment [of land] that you shall set apart _and_ offer to the LORD _shall be_ 25,000 _cubits_ in length and 10,000 in width. ## Portion for the Priests 















###### 10 







The holy allotment shall be for these, _namely_ for the priests, toward the north 25,000 _cubits in length_, and toward the west 10,000 in width, and toward the east 10,000 in width, and toward the south 25,000 in length; and the sanctuary of the LORD shall be in the midst of it. 















###### 11 







_It shall be_ for the priests who are sanctified of the sons of Zadok, who have kept My charge, and who did not go astray when the children (descendants) of Israel went astray as the [other] Levites did. 















###### 12 







And this [land offering] shall be an allotment to them from the allotment of the land, a most holy portion beside the border of the [other] Levites. 















###### 13 







Alongside the border of the priests, the [other] Levites _shall have_ 25,000 _cubits_ in length and 10,000 in width. The whole length _shall be_ 25,000 _cubits_ and the width 10,000. 















###### 14 







And they shall not sell any of it or exchange it, or allow this choice _portion_ of land to pass _to others_; for it is holy to the LORD. 















###### 15 







"The remaining [strip of] 5,000 _cubits_ in width and 25,000 in length shall be for the city's common (secular) use, for a place in which to live and for open country. The city shall be in the midst of it. 















###### 16 







These _shall be_ the measurements of it: the north side 4,500 _cubits_, the south side 4,500, the east side 4,500, and the west side 4,500. 















###### 17 







The city shall have open country: toward the north 250 _cubits_, and toward the south 250, toward the east 250, and toward the west 250. 















###### 18 







The remainder of the length alongside the holy allotment shall be 10,000 _cubits_ to the east and 10,000 to the west; and it shall be beside the holy allotment. The produce from it shall be food for the workers of the city. 















###### 19 







The workers of the city, from all the tribes of Israel shall cultivate it. 















###### 20 







The whole allotment _shall be_ 25,000 by 25,000 _cubits_; you shall set apart the holy allotment, a square, with the property of the city. ## Portion for the Prince 















###### 21 







"The remainder, on both sides of the holy allotment and of the property possessed by the city, _shall belong_ to the prince. In front of the 25,000 _cubits_ of the allotment toward the east border and westward in front of the 25,000 toward the west border, alongside the [tribal] portions, _it shall be_ for the prince. The holy allotment with the sanctuary of the temple shall be in the midst of it. 















###### 22 







Exclusive of the property of the Levites and of the property of the city, which are in the middle of that which belongs to the prince, _everything_ between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin shall be for the prince. ## Portion for Other Tribes 















###### 23 







"As for the rest of the tribes: from the east side to the west side, Benjamin, one _portion_. 















###### 24 







Beside the border of Benjamin, from the east side to the west side, Simeon, one _portion_. 















###### 25 







Beside the border of Simeon, from the east side to the west side, Issachar, one _portion_.

And beside the border of Gad, at the south side, southward, the border shall extend from Tamar to the waters of Meribath-kadesh, to the Brook [of Egypt], to the Great [Mediterranean] Sea. 















###### 29 







This is the land which you shall divide by lot among the tribes of Israel as their inheritance, and these are their _several_ portions," says the Lord God. ## The City Gates 















###### 30 







"These are the exits of the city: on the north side, [which is to extend] 4,500 _cubits_ by measurement, 















###### 31 







there shall also be gates of the city, _named_ after the names of the tribes of Israel, three gates toward the north: one gate of Reuben, one gate of Judah, one gate of Levi. 















###### 32 







On the east side, 4,500 _cubits_, also three gates: one gate of Joseph, one gate of Benjamin, one gate of Dan. 















###### 33 







On the south side, 4,500 _cubits_, by measurement, also three gates: one gate of Simeon, one gate of Issachar, one gate of Zebulun.

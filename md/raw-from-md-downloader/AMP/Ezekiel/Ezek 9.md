# Ezekiel 9

***
















###### 1 







Then [in my vision] I heard Him cry out with a thunderous voice, saying, "Approach now, executioners of the city, each with his weapon of destruction in his hand." 















###### 2 







Behold, six men [angelic beings] came from the direction of the Upper Gate, which faces north, each with his battle-axe in his hand; and among them was a [^a]certain man clothed in linen, with a scribe's writing case at his side. They entered and stood beside the bronze altar. 















###### 3 







Then the [[^b]Shekinah] glory _and_ brilliance of the God of Israel (the cloud) [^c]went up from the cherubim on which it had rested, to [stand above] the threshold of the [Lord's] temple. And the LORD called to the man clothed with linen, who had the scribe's writing case at his side. 















###### 4 







The LORD said to him, "Go through the midst of the city, throughout all of Jerusalem, and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who sigh [in distress] and grieve over all the repulsive acts which are being committed in it." 















###### 5 







But to the others I heard Him say, "Follow him [the man with the scribe's writing case] throughout the city and strike; do not let your eyes have pity and do not spare [anyone]. 















###### 6 







Utterly slay old men, young men, maidens, little children, and women; but do not touch _or_ go near anyone on whom is the mark. Begin at My sanctuary." So they began with the old men who were in front of the temple [who did not have the Lord's mark on their foreheads]. 















###### 7 







And He said to the executioners, "Defile the temple and fill its courtyards with the dead. Go out!" So they went out and struck down _the people_ in the city. 















###### 8 







As they were executing them and I _alone_ was left, I fell face downward and cried out, "Alas, Lord God! Will You destroy all that is left of Israel [the whole remnant] by pouring out Your wrath _and_ indignation on Jerusalem?" 















###### 9 







Then He said to me, "The wickedness (guilt) of the house of Israel and Judah is extremely great; the land is full of blood and the city is full of perversion _and_ injustice; for they say, 'The LORD has abandoned the land; the LORD does not see [what we are doing].' 















###### 10 







But as for Me, My eye will have no pity, nor will I spare, but I will bring their [wicked] conduct upon their [own] heads." 















###### 11 







Then behold, the man clothed in linen, who had the scribe's writing case at his side, reported, "I have done just as You have commanded me." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

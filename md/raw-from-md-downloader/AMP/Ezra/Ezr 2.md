[^b]: Ezra 2:2 Not the author of the Book of Nehemiah. [^c]: Ezra 2:2 Not the relative of Esther. [^d]: Ezra 2:63 Heb _Tirshatha_, a Persian title. Probably either Sheshbazzar or Zerubbabel. [^e]: Ezra 2:63 But the effort doubtless would have been in vain. Long-standing disobedience had apparently caused Israelâ€™s priests to forfeit the divine gift of guidance through Urim and Thummim, and it was never recovered. Except for a similar incident in Neh 7:65, Urim and Thummim are not again mentioned in the Scriptures. The higher revelation by the prophets superseded them as interpreters of the will of God (see also Ex 28:30; Amos 3:7). [^f]: Ezra 2:68 I.e. patriarchs.

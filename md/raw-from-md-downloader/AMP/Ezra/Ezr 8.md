These are the heads of their fathers' _households_ and _this is_ the genealogy of those who went up with me from Babylon in the reign of King Artaxerxes: 















###### 2 







of the [^a]sons of Phinehas, Gershom; of the sons of Ithamar, Daniel; of the sons of David, Hattush; 















###### 3 







of the sons of Shecaniah _who was_ of the sons of Parosh, Zechariah, and with him were registered 150 men by genealogy; 















###### 4

###### 14 







and of the sons of Bigvai, Uthai and [^c]Zabbud, with 70 men. ## Ezra Sends for Levites 















###### 15 







Now I gathered them together at the river that runs to Ahava, where we camped for three days. I observed the people and the priests, and I did not find any Levites there. 















###### 16 







So I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, [who were] leading men, and also for Joiarib and Elnathan, [who were] teachers. 















###### 17 







And I sent them to Iddo, the leading man at the place Casiphia, telling them what to say to Iddo and his brothers, the temple servants at the place Casiphia, _that is_, to bring us servants (ministers) for the house of our God. 















###### 18 







And as the good hand of our God was upon us, they brought us a man of understanding (insight) from the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel, _named_ Sherebiah, with his sons and his brothers (relatives), 18 men; 















###### 19 







and Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, with his brothers (relatives) and their sons, 20 men; 















###### 20 







also 220 of the temple servants, whom David and the leaders had set apart [with their descendants] for the service of the Levites. They were all designated by name. ## Protection of God Invoked 















###### 21 







Then I proclaimed a fast there at the river Ahava, so that we might humble ourselves before our God to seek from Him a safe journey for us, our [^d]children, and all our possessions. 















###### 22 







For I was ashamed to request troops and horsemen from the king to protect us from the enemy along the way, because we had told the king, "The hand of our God is favorable toward all those who seek Him, but His power and His anger are against all those who abandon (turn away from) Him." 















###### 23 







So we fasted and sought [help from] our God concerning this [matter], and He heard our plea. 















###### 24 







Then I set apart twelve leading priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brothers (relatives), 















###### 25 







and I weighed out to them the silver, the gold, and the utensils, the offering for the house of our God which the king, his advisers, his officials, and all Israel who were present there had offered. 















###### 26 







I weighed into their hands 650 talents of silver, and silver utensils _worth_ 100 talents, and 100 talents of gold; 















###### 27 







also 20 bowls of gold _worth_ 1,000 darics, and two utensils of fine [^e]shiny bronze, precious as gold. 















###### 28 







Then I said to them, "You are holy to the LORD, the utensils are holy, and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering to the LORD God of your fathers. 















###### 29 







Guard and keep them until you weigh them before the leading priests and the Levites and the leaders of the fathers' _households_ of Israel in Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the LORD." 















###### 30 







So the priests and the Levites received the weighed out silver and gold, and the utensils, to bring them to Jerusalem to the house of our God. 















###### 31 







We set out from the river Ahava on the twelfth [day] of the first month to go to Jerusalem; and the hand of our God was upon us, and He rescued us from the hand of the enemy and those who lay in ambushes along the way. 















###### 32 







So we came to Jerusalem and remained there for three days. ## Treasure Placed in the Temple 















###### 33 







On the fourth day the silver and the gold and the utensils were weighed out in the house of our God into the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest, and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them were the Levites--Jozabad the son of Jeshua and Noadiah the son of Binnui. 















###### 34 







Every piece was counted and weighed, and all the weight was recorded at that time. 















###### 35 







Also the [former] exiles who had come from the captivity offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel: 12 bulls for all Israel, 96 rams, 77 lambs, and 12 male goats for a sin offering. All this was a burnt offering to the LORD. 















###### 36 







And they delivered the king's edicts to the king's satraps (lieutenants) and to the governors [^f]west of the [Euphrates] River, and they supported the people and God's house. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

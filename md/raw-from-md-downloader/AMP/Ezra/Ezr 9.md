# Ezra 9

***
















###### 1 







When these things were completed, the officials came to me and said, "The people of Israel and the priests and Levites have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands, but have committed the repulsive acts of the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians, and Amorites. 















###### 2 







For they have taken some of their daughters _as wives_ for themselves and for their sons, so that the holy [^a]race has [^b]intermingled with the peoples of the lands. Indeed, the officials and chief men have been foremost in this unfaithful act _and_ direct violation [of God's will]." 















###### 3 







When I heard this, I tore my clothing and my robe [in grief], I pulled out some of the hair from my head and my beard, and sat down appalled [at the shame of it]. 















###### 4 







Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel because of the unfaithfulness of the exiles gathered to me as I sat appalled until the evening offering. ## Prayer of Confession 















###### 5 







At the evening offering I arose from my [time of] humiliation _and_ penitence and having torn my clothing and my robe, I fell on my knees and stretched out my hands to the LORD my God, 















###### 6 







and I said, "O my God, I am ashamed and embarrassed to lift up my face to You, my God, for our wrongdoings have risen higher than our heads and our guilt has grown to the heavens. 















###### 7 







Since the days of our fathers to this day we have been exceedingly guilty; and on account of our wrongdoings we, our kings, and our priests have been handed over to the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, to plundering, and to complete shame, as it is today. 















###### 8 







But now for a brief moment grace has been [shown to us] from the LORD our God, who has left us a surviving remnant and has given us a peg (secure hold) in His holy place, that our God may enlighten our eyes and give us a little reviving in our bondage. 















###### 9 







For we are slaves; yet our God has not abandoned us in our bondage, but has extended lovingkindness to us before the kings of Persia, to revive us to rebuild the house of our God, to repair the site of its ruins and to give us a wall [of protection] in Judah and Jerusalem. 















###### 10 







"Now, O our God, what shall we say after this? For we have abandoned (turned away from) Your commandments, 















###### 11 







which You have commanded by Your servants the prophets, saying, 'The land which you are entering to possess is a defiled land with the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands, through their repulsive acts which have filled it from one end to the other _along_ with their impurity. 















###### 12 







So now do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons; and never seek their peace or their prosperity, so that you may be strong and eat the good _things_ of the land and leave it as an inheritance to your children forever.' 















###### 13 







And after everything that has come upon us for our evil deeds and for our great guilt, since You our God have punished us less than our wrongdoings _deserve_, and have given us survivors like these, 















###### 14 







shall we again break Your commandments and intermarry with the peoples who practice these repulsive acts? Would You not be angry with us to the point of total destruction, so that there would be no remnant nor survivor? 















###### 15 







O LORD God of Israel, You are [uncompromisingly] just (righteous), for we have been left as survivors, as it is this day. Behold, we are before You in our guilt, for no one can stand before You because of this." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

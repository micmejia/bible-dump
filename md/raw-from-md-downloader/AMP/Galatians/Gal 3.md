# Galatians 3

***
















###### 1 







O you foolish _and_ thoughtless _and_ superficial Galatians, who has bewitched you [that you would act like this], to whom--right before your very eyes--Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified [in the gospel message]? 















###### 2 







This is all I want to ask of you: did you receive the [Holy] Spirit as the result of obeying [the requirements of] the Law, or was it the result of hearing [the message of salvation and] with faith [believing it]? 















###### 3 







Are you so foolish _and_ senseless? Having begun [your new life by faith] with the Spirit, are you now being perfected _and_ reaching spiritual maturity by the flesh [that is, by your own works and efforts to keep the Law]? 















###### 4 







Have you suffered so many things _and_ experienced so much all for nothing--if indeed it was all for nothing? 















###### 5 







So then, does He who supplies you with His [marvelous Holy] Spirit and works miracles among you, do it as a result of the works of the Law [which you perform], or because you [believe confidently in the message which you] heard with faith? 















###### 6 







Just as Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness, [as conformity to God's will and purpose--so it is with you also]. 















###### 7 







So understand that it is the people who live by faith [with confidence in the power and goodness of God] who are [the true] sons of [^a]Abraham. 















###### 8 







The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, proclaimed the good news [of the Savior] to Abraham in advance [with this promise], _saying_, "In you shall all the nations be blessed." 















###### 9 







So then those who are people of faith [whether Jew or Gentile] are blessed _and_ favored by God [and declared free of the guilt of sin and its penalty, and placed in right standing with Him] along with Abraham, the believer. 















###### 10 







For all who depend on the Law [seeking justification and salvation by obedience to the Law and the observance of rituals] are under a curse; for it is written, "Cursed (condemned to destruction) is everyone who does not abide by all things written in the book of the law, so as to practice them." 















###### 11 







Now it is clear that no one is justified [that is, declared free of the guilt of sin and its penalty, and placed in right standing] before God by the Law, for "The righteous (the just, the upright) shall live by faith." 















###### 12 







But the Law does not rest on _or_ require faith [it has nothing to do with faith], but [instead, the Law] _says_, "He who practices them [the things prescribed by the Law] shall live by them [instead of faith]." 















###### 13 







Christ purchased our freedom _and_ redeemed us from the curse of the Law _and_ its condemnation by becoming a curse for us--for it is written, "Cursed is everyone who hangs [crucified] on a tree (cross)"-- 















###### 14 







in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might also come to the Gentiles, so that we would all receive [the realization of] the promise of the [Holy] Spirit through faith. ## Intent of the Law 















###### 15 







Brothers and sisters, I speak in terms of human relations: even though a last will and testament is just a human covenant, yet when it has been signed _and_ made legally binding, no one sets it aside or adds to it [modifying it in some way]. 















###### 16 







Now the promises [in the covenants] were decreed to Abraham and to his seed. God does not say, "And to seeds (descendants, heirs)," as if [referring] to many [persons], but as to one, "And to your Seed," who is [none other than] Christ. 















###### 17 







This is what I mean: the Law, which came into existence four hundred and thirty years later [after the covenant concerning the coming Messiah], does not _and_ cannot invalidate the covenant previously established by God, so as to abolish the promise. 















###### 18 







For if the inheritance [of what was promised] is based on [observing] the Law [as these false teachers claim], it is no longer based on a promise; however, God granted it to Abraham [as a gift] by virtue of His promise. 















###### 19 







Why, then, the Law [what was its purpose]? It was added [after the promise to Abraham, to reveal to people their guilt] because of transgressions [that is, to make people conscious of the sinfulness of sin], and [the Law] was ordained through angels _and_ delivered to Israel by the hand of a mediator [Moses, the mediator between God and Israel, to be in effect] until the Seed would come to whom the promise had been made. 















###### 20 







Now the mediator _or_ go-between [in a transaction] is not [needed] for just one _party_; whereas God is _only_ one [and was the only One giving the promise to Abraham, but the Law was a contract between two, God and Israel; its validity depended on both]. 















###### 21 







Is the Law then contrary to the promises of God? Certainly not! For if a _system of_ law had been given which could impart life, then righteousness (right standing with God) would actually have been based on law. 















###### 22 







But the Scripture has imprisoned [^b]everyone [everything--the entire world] under sin, so that [the inheritance, the blessing of salvation] which was promised through faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe [in Him and acknowledge Him as God's precious Son]. 















###### 23 







Now before faith came, we were kept in custody under the Law, [perpetually] imprisoned [in preparation] for the faith that was destined to be revealed, 















###### 24 







with the result that the Law has become our tutor _and_ our disciplinarian _to guide us_ to Christ, so that we may be [^c]justified [that is, declared free of the guilt of sin and its penalty, and placed in right standing with God] by faith. 















###### 25 







But now that faith has come, we are no longer under [the control and authority of] a tutor _and_ disciplinarian. 















###### 26 







For you [who are born-again have been reborn from above--spiritually transformed, renewed, sanctified and] are all children of God [set apart for His purpose with full rights and privileges] through faith in Christ Jesus. 















###### 27 







For all of you who were baptized into Christ [into a spiritual union with the Christ, the Anointed] have clothed yourselves with Christ [that is, you have taken on His characteristics and values]. 















###### 28 







There is [now no distinction in regard to salvation] neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you [who believe] are all one in Christ Jesus [no one can claim a spiritual superiority]. 















###### 29 







And if you belong to Christ [if you are in Him], then you are Abraham's descendants, and [spiritual] heirs according to [God's] promise. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: Galatians 3:22 Lit _all things_. Paul is probably referring to the effect of sin on the entire world. He alludes to this in Rom 8:19-22. Consider, for example, the fact that God cursed the ground itself and plant life because of the sin of Adam and Eve (Gen 3:17, 18). [^c]: Galatians 3:24 See note 2:16.

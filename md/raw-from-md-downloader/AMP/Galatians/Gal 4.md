# Galatians 4

***
















###### 1 







Now what I mean [when I talk about children and their guardians] is this: as long as the heir is a child, he does not differ at all from a slave even though he is the [future owner and] master of all [the estate]; 















###### 2 







but he is under [the authority of] guardians and household administrators _or_ managers until the date set by his father [when he is of legal age]. 















###### 3 







So also we [whether Jews or Gentiles], when we were children (spiritually immature), were kept like slaves under the elementary [man-made religious or philosophical] teachings of the world. 















###### 4 







But when [in God's plan] the proper time had fully come, God sent His Son, born of a woman, born under the [regulations of the] Law, 















###### 5 







so that He might redeem _and_ liberate those who were under the Law, that we [who believe] might be adopted as sons [as God's children with all rights as fully grown members of a family]. 















###### 6 







And because you [really] are [His] sons, God has sent the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying out, [^a]"Abba! Father!" 















###### 7 







Therefore you are no longer a slave (bond-servant), but a son; and if a son, then also an heir through [the gracious act of] God [through Christ]. 















###### 8 







But at that time, when you did not know [the true] God _and_ were unacquainted with Him, you [Gentiles] were slaves to those [pagan] things which by [their very] nature were not _and_ could not be gods _at all_. 















###### 9 







Now, however, since you have come to know [the true] God [through personal experience], or rather to be known by God, how is it that you are turning back again to the weak and worthless elemental principles [of religions and philosophies], to which you want to be enslaved all over again? 















###### 10 







[For example,] you observe [particular] days and months and seasons and years. 















###### 11 







I fear for you, that perhaps I have labored [to the point of exhaustion] over you in vain. 















###### 12 







Believers, I beg of you, become as I am [free from the bondage of Jewish ritualism and ordinances], for I _have become_ as you are [a Gentile]. You did me no wrong [when I first came to you; do not do it now]. 















###### 13 







On the contrary, you know that it was because of a physical illness that I [remained and] preached the gospel to you the first time; 















###### 14 







and even though my physical condition was a trial to you, you did not regard it with contempt, or scorn _and_ reject me; but you received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus _Himself_. 















###### 15 







What then has become of that sense of blessing _and_ the joy that you once had [from your salvation and your relationship with Christ]? For I testify of you that, if possible, you would have torn out your own eyes and given them to me [[^b]to replace mine]. 















###### 16 







So have I become your enemy by telling you the truth? 















###### 17 







These men [the Judaizers] eagerly seek you [to entrap you with honeyed words and attention, to win you over to their philosophy], not honorably [for their purpose is not honorable or worthy of consideration]. They want to isolate you [from us who oppose them] so that you will seek them. 















###### 18 







Now it is always pleasant to be eagerly sought after [provided that it is] for a good purpose, and not just when I am with you [seeking you myself--but beware of the others doing it]. 















###### 19 







My little children, for whom I am again in [the pains of] labor until Christ is [completely and permanently] formed within you-- 















###### 20 







how I wish that I were with you now and could change my tone, because I am perplexed in regard to you. ## Bond and Free 















###### 21 







Tell me, you who are bent on being under the Law, do you not listen to [what] the Law [really says]? 















###### 22 







For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman [Hagar] and one by the free woman [Sarah]. 















###### 23 







But the child of the slave woman was born according to the flesh _and_ had an ordinary birth, while the son of the free woman was born in fulfillment of the promise. 















###### 24 







Now these facts are about to be used [by me] as an allegory [that is, I will illustrate by using them]: for these _women_ can represent two covenants: one [covenant originated] from Mount Sinai [where the Law was given] that bears children [destined] for slavery; she is Hagar. 















###### 25 







Now Hagar is (represents) Mount Sinai in Arabia and she corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children. 















###### 26 







But the Jerusalem above [that is, the way of faith, represented by Sarah] is free; she is our mother. 















###### 27 







For it is written [in the Scriptures], "Rejoice, o barren woman who has not given birth; Break forth into a [joyful] shout, you who are not in labor; For the desolate woman has many more children Than she who has a husband." 















###### 28 







And we, [believing] brothers and sisters, like Isaac, are children [not merely of physical descent, like Ishmael, but are children born] of promise [born miraculously]. 















###### 29 







But as at that time the child [of ordinary birth] born according to the flesh persecuted the son _who was born_ according to [the promise and working of] the Spirit, so it is now also. 















###### 30 







But what does the Scripture say? "Cast out the bondwoman [Hagar] and her son [Ishmael], For never shall the son of the bondwoman be heir _and_ share the inheritance with the son of the free woman." 















###### 31 







So then, believers, we [who are born again--reborn from above--spiritually transformed, renewed, and set apart for His purpose] are not children of a slave woman [the natural], but of the free woman [the supernatural]. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

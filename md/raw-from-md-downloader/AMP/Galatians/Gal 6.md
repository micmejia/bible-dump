# Galatians 6

***
















###### 1 







Brothers, if anyone is caught in any sin, you who are spiritual [that is, you who are responsive to the guidance of the Spirit] are to restore such a person in a spirit of gentleness [not with a sense of superiority or self-righteousness], keeping a watchful eye on yourself, so that you are not tempted as well. 















###### 2 







Carry one another's burdens and in this way you will fulfill the requirements of the law of Christ [that is, the law of Christian love]. 















###### 3 







For if anyone thinks he is something [special] when [in fact] he is nothing [special except in his own eyes], he deceives himself. 















###### 4 







But each one must carefully scrutinize his own work [examining his actions, attitudes, and behavior], and then he can have the personal satisfaction and inner joy of doing something commendable [^a]without comparing himself to another. 















###### 5 







For every person will have to bear [with patience] his own burden [of faults and shortcomings for which he alone is responsible]. 















###### 6 







The one who is taught the word [of God] is to share all good things with his teacher [contributing to his spiritual and material support]. 















###### 7 







Do not be deceived, God is not mocked [He will not allow Himself to be ridiculed, nor treated with contempt nor allow His precepts to be scornfully set aside]; for whatever a man sows, this _and_ this only is what he will reap. 















###### 8 







For the one who sows to his flesh [his sinful capacity, his worldliness, his disgraceful impulses] will reap from the flesh ruin _and_ destruction, but the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life. 















###### 9 







Let us not grow weary _or_ become discouraged in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap, if we do not give in. 















###### 10 







So then, while we [as individual believers] have the opportunity, let us do good to all people [not only being helpful, but also doing that which promotes their spiritual well-being], and especially [be a blessing] to those of the household of faith (born-again believers). 















###### 11 







See with what [^b]large letters I [^c]am writing to you with my own hand. 















###### 12 







Those who want to make a good impression in public [before the Jews] try to compel you to be circumcised, just so they will escape being persecuted for [faithfulness to] the cross of Christ. 















###### 13 







For even the circumcised [Jews] themselves do not [really] keep the Law, but they want to have you circumcised so that they may boast in your flesh [that is, in the fact that they convinced you to be circumcised]. 















###### 14 







But far be it from me to boast [in anything or anyone], except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. 















###### 15 







For neither is circumcision anything [of any importance], nor uncircumcision, but [only] a new creation [which is the result of a new birth--a spiritual transformation--a new nature in Christ Jesus]. 















###### 16 







Peace and mercy be upon all who walk by this rule [who discipline themselves and conduct their lives by this principle], and upon the [true] Israel of God (Jewish believers). 















###### 17 







From now on let no one trouble me [by making it necessary for me to justify my authority as an apostle, and the absolute truth of the gospel], for I bear on my body the [^d]branding-marks of Jesus [the wounds, scars, and other outward evidence of persecutions--these testify to His ownership of me]. 















###### 18 







The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, my [^e]brothers and sisters. Amen. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: Galatians 6:11 Paul frequently dictated his letters to a secretary (such as Tertius, Rom 16:22). In this case, however, he applied the ink himself. His reference to “large letters” has been variously interpreted: (1) Paul may have been using large print for emphasis; or (2) Paul may have been referring to some problem with his vision (cf 4:15).

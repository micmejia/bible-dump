# Genesis 10

***
















###### 1 







These are _the records of_ the generations (descendants) of Shem, Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah; and the sons born to them after the flood: 















###### 2 







the sons of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras; 















###### 3 







the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah; 















###### 4 







the sons of Javan: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. 















###### 5 







From these, [the people of] the coastlands of the nations were separated _and_ spread into their lands, every one [^a]according to his own language, according to their constituent groups (families), _and_ into their nations: 















###### 6 







the sons of Ham: Cush, Mizraim [from whom descended the Egyptians], Put, and Canaan; 















###### 7 







the sons of Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca; and the sons of Raamah; Sheba and Dedan. 















###### 8 







Cush became the father of Nimrod; he became a mighty one on the earth. 















###### 9 







He was a mighty hunter before the LORD; therefore it is said, "Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before the LORD." 















###### 10 







The beginning of his kingdom was [^b]Babel and Erech and Accad and Calneh, in the land of Shinar [in Babylonia]. 















###### 11 







From that land Nimrod went to Assyria, and built Nineveh, and Rehoboth-Ir, and Calah, 















###### 12 







and [Nimrod built] Resen, which is between Nineveh and Calah; all these [combined to form] the great city [Nineveh]. 















###### 13 







Mizraim [the ancestor of the Egyptians] became the father of Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim 















###### 14 







and Pathrusim and Casluhim--from whom came the Philistines--and Caphtorim. 















###### 15 







Canaan became the father of Sidon, his firstborn, and Heth 















###### 16 







and the Jebusite and the Amorite and the Girgashite 















###### 17 







and the Hivite and the Arkite and the Sinite 















###### 18 







and the Arvadite and the Zemarite and the Hamathite. Afterward the families of the Canaanite were spread abroad. 















###### 19 







The territory of the Canaanite extended from Sidon as one goes to Gerar, as far as Gaza; and as one goes to [^c]Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha. 















###### 20 







These are the descendants of Ham according to their constituent groups, according to their languages, by their lands, and by their nations. 















###### 21 







Also to Shem, the father of all the children of Eber [including the Hebrews], the [^d]older brother of Japheth, children were born. 















###### 22 







The sons of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud and Aram; 















###### 23 







the sons of Aram [ancestor of the Syrians]: Uz, Hul, Gether and [^e]Mash. 















###### 24 







Arpachshad became the father of Shelah; and Shelah became the father of Eber. 















###### 25 







Two sons were born to Eber; the name of one was Peleg (division), for [the inhabitants of] the earth were divided in his days; and his brother's name was Joktan. 















###### 26 







Joktan became the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, 















###### 27 







and Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, 















###### 28 







and [^f]Obal, Abimael, Sheba, 















###### 29 







and Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan. 















###### 30 







Now their territory extended from Mesha as one goes toward Sephar, to the hill country of the east. 















###### 31 







These are Shem's descendants according to their constituent groups (families), according to their languages, by their lands, according to their nations. 















###### 32 







These are the families of the sons of Noah, according to their descendants, by their nations; and from these [people] the nations were separated _and_ spread abroad on the earth after the flood. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

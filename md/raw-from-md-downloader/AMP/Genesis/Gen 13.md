# Genesis 13

***
















###### 1 







So Abram went up out of Egypt, he and his wife and all that he had, and Lot [his nephew] with him, into the Negev (the South country of Judah). 















###### 2 







Now Abram was extremely rich in livestock and in silver and in gold. 















###### 3 







He journeyed on from the Negev as far as Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai, 















###### 4 







where he had first built an altar; and there Abram called on the name of the LORD [in prayer]. 















###### 5 







But Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents. 















###### 6 







Now the land was not able to support them [that is, sustain all their grazing and water needs] while they lived near one another, for their possessions were too great for them to stay together. 















###### 7 







And there was strife _and_ quarreling between the herdsmen of Abram's cattle and the herdsmen of Lot's cattle. Now the Canaanite and the Perizzite were living in the land at that same time [making grazing of the livestock difficult]. 















###### 8 







So Abram said to Lot, "Please let there be no strife _and_ disagreement between you and me, nor between your herdsmen and my herdsmen, because we are relatives. 















###### 9 







Is not the entire land before you? Please separate [yourself] from me. If you take the left, then I will go to the right; or if you choose the right, then I will go to the left." 















###### 10 







So Lot looked and saw that the valley of the Jordan was well watered everywhere--this was before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah; [it was all] like the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as you go to Zoar [at the south end of the Dead Sea]. 















###### 11 







Then Lot chose for himself all the valley of the Jordan, and he traveled east. So they separated from each other. 















###### 12 







Abram settled in the land of Canaan, and Lot settled in the cities of the valley and camped as far as Sodom _and_ lived there. 















###### 13 







But the men of Sodom were extremely wicked and sinful against the LORD [unashamed in their open sin before Him]. 















###### 14 







The LORD said to Abram, after Lot had left him, "Now lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are _standing_, northward and southward and eastward and westward; 















###### 15 







for all the land which you see I will give to you and to your descendants forever. 















###### 16 







I will make your descendants [as numerous] as the dust of the earth, so that if a man could count the [grains of] dust of the earth, then your descendants could also be counted. 















###### 17 







Arise, walk (make a thorough reconnaissance) around in the land, through its length and its width, for I will give it to you." 















###### 18 







Then Abram broke camp _and_ moved his tent, and came and settled by the [grove of the great] terebinths (oak trees) of Mamre [the Amorite], which are in Hebron, and there he built an altar to [honor] the LORD. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

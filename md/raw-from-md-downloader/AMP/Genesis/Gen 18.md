# Genesis 18

***
















###### 1 







Now the LORD appeared to Abraham by the terebinth _trees_ of Mamre [in Hebron], while he was sitting at the tent door in the heat of the day. 















###### 2 







When he raised his eyes and looked up, behold, three men were standing [a little distance] from him. When he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them and bowed down [with his face] to the ground, 















###### 3 







and Abraham said, "My [^a]lord, if now I have found favor in your sight, please do not pass by your servant [without stopping to visit]. 















###### 4 







Please let a little water be brought [by one of my servants] and [you may] wash your feet, and recline _and_ rest comfortably under the tree. 















###### 5 







And I will bring a piece of bread to refresh _and_ sustain [^b]you; after that you may go on, since you have come to your servant." And they replied, "Do as you have said." 















###### 6 







So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah, and said, "Quickly, get ready three [^c]measures of fine meal, knead it and bake cakes." 















###### 7 







Abraham also ran to the herd and brought a calf, tender and choice, and he gave it to the servant [to butcher], and he hurried to prepare it. 















###### 8 







Then he took [^d]curds and milk and the calf which he had prepared, and set it before the men; and he stood beside them under the tree while they ate. 















###### 9 







Then they said to him, "Where is Sarah your wife?" And he said, "There, in the tent." 















###### 10 







He said, "I will surely return to you at this [^e]time next year; and behold, Sarah your wife will have a son." And Sarah was listening at the tent door, which was behind him. 















###### 11 







Now Abraham and Sarah were old, well advanced in years; she was past [the age of] childbearing. 















###### 12 







So Sarah laughed to herself [when she heard the Lord's words], saying, "After I have become old, shall I have pleasure _and_ delight, my lord (husband) being also old?" 















###### 13 







And the LORD asked Abraham, "Why did Sarah laugh [to herself], saying, 'Shall I really give birth [to a child] when I am so old?' 















###### 14 







Is anything too difficult _or_ too wonderful for the [^f]LORD? At the appointed time, when the season [for her delivery] comes, I will return to you and Sarah will have a son." 















###### 15 







Then Sarah denied it, saying, "I did not laugh"; because she was afraid. And He (the LORD) said, "No, but you did laugh." 















###### 16 







Then the men got up from there, and looked toward Sodom; and Abraham walked with them to send them on the way. 















###### 17 







The LORD said, "Shall I keep secret from Abraham [My friend and servant] what I am going to do, 















###### 18 







since Abraham [^g]is destined to become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed through him? 















###### 19 







For I have known (chosen, acknowledged) him [as My own], so that he may teach _and_ command his children and [the sons of] his household after him to keep the way of the LORD by doing what is righteous and just, so that the LORD may bring upon Abraham what He has promised him." 















###### 20 







And the LORD said, "The outcry [of the sin] of Sodom and Gomorrah is indeed great, and their sin is exceedingly grave. 















###### 21 







I will go down now, and see whether they have acted [as vilely and wickedly] as the outcry which has come to Me [indicates]; and if not, I will know." 















###### 22 







Now the [two] men (angelic beings) turned away from there and went toward Sodom, but Abraham remained standing before the LORD. 















###### 23 







Abraham approached [the LORD] and said, "Will You really sweep away the righteous (those who do right) with the wicked (those who do evil)? 















###### 24 







Suppose there are fifty righteous [people] within the city; will You really sweep it away and not spare it for the sake of the fifty righteous who are in it? 















###### 25 







Far be it from You to do [^h]such a thing--to strike the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous and the wicked are _treated_ alike. Far be it from You! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right [by executing just and righteous judgment]?" 















###### 26 







So the LORD said, "If I find within the city of Sodom fifty righteous [people], then I will spare the entire place for their sake." 















###### 27 







Abraham answered, "Now behold, I who am but dust [in origin] and ashes have decided to speak to the Lord. 















###### 28 







If five of the fifty righteous are lacking, will You destroy the entire city for lack of five?" And He said, "If I find [at least] forty-five [righteous people] there, I will not destroy it." 















###### 29 







Abraham spoke to Him yet again and said, "Suppose [only] forty are found there." And He said, "I will not do it for the sake of the forty [who are righteous]." 















###### 30 







Then Abraham said [to Him], "Oh, may the Lord not be angry, and I will speak; suppose thirty [righteous people] are found there?" And He said, "I will not do it if I find thirty there." 















###### 31 







And he said, "Now behold, I have decided to speak to the Lord [again]. Suppose [only] twenty [righteous people] are found there?" And the Lord said, "I will not destroy it for the sake of the twenty." 















###### 32 







Then Abraham said, "Oh may the Lord not be angry [with me], and I will speak only this once; suppose ten [righteous people] are found there?" And He said, "I will not destroy it for the sake of the ten." 















###### 33 







As soon as He had finished speaking with Abraham the LORD departed, and Abraham returned to his own place. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

Verse 13 confirms that it was the Lord who spoke to him. The other two men were angels. [^b]: Genesis 18:5 Lit _your heart_. [^c]: Genesis 18:6 Heb _seim_, plural of _seah_; since one _seah_ equals about nine quarts, this was a large quantity. However, Abraham was asking Sarah to make cakes of bread which actually could be baked quickly because they were similar to pizza dough, that is, large, round, and flat. Together with the other food that Abraham provided (vv 7, 8), his promise of “a piece of bread” in v 5 was greatly understated, and the generous meal reflected the respect that he held for his special visitors. [^d]: Genesis 18:8 Or _sour milk_, or perhaps _butter_. It may have served as a kind of condiment for the bread. [^e]: Genesis 18:10 Lit _when the time revives_. Some regard this as a reference to springtime. Others think it means “the time when the life is ready.” [^f]: Genesis 18:14 The divine Hebrew name _YHWH (Yahweh)_, usually represented by “Lord,” occurs more than 5,000 times in the Bible. [^g]: Genesis 18:18 Lit _will surely_. [^h]: Genesis 18:25 Lit _according to this word_.

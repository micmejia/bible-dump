# Genesis 19

***
















###### 1 







It was evening when the two angels came to Sodom. Lot was sitting at Sodom's [[^a]city] gate. Seeing them, Lot got up to meet them and bowed down _with his_ face to the ground. 















###### 2 







And he said, "See here, my lords, please turn aside _and_ come into your servant's house, and spend the night, and wash your feet; then you may get up early and go on your way." But they said, "No, we shall spend the night in the open plaza [of the city]." 















###### 3 







However, Lot strongly urged them, so they turned aside and entered his house; and he prepared a feast for them [with wine], and baked unleavened bread, and they ate. 















###### 4 







But before they lay down [to sleep], the men of the city, the men of Sodom, both young and old, surrounded the house, [^b]all the men from every quarter; 















###### 5 







and they called out to Lot and said to him, "Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we may know them [intimately]." 















###### 6 







But Lot went out of the doorway to the men, and shut the door after him, 















###### 7 







and said, "Please, my brothers, do not do something so wicked. 















###### 8 







See here, I have two daughters who have not known a man [intimately]; please let me bring them out to you [instead], and you can do as you please with them; only do nothing to these men, because they have in fact come under the shelter of my roof [for protection]." 















###### 9 







But they said, "Get out of the way!" And they said, "This man (Lot) came [as an outsider] to live here temporarily, and now he is acting like a judge. Now we will treat you worse than your visitors!" So they rushed forward _and_ pressed violently against [^c]Lot and came close to breaking down the door [of his house]. 















###### 10 







But the men (angels) reached out with their hands and pulled Lot into the house with them, and shut the door [after him]. 















###### 11 







They struck (punished) the men who were at the doorway of the house with blindness, from the young men to the old men, so that they exhausted _themselves trying_ to find the doorway. 















###### 12 







And the [two] men (angels) asked Lot, "Have you any others here [in Sodom]--a son-in-law, and your sons, and your daughters? Whomever you have in the city, take them out of here; 















###### 13 







for we are destroying this place, because the outcry [for judgment] against them has grown so great before the LORD that the LORD has sent us to destroy _and_ ruin it." 















###### 14 







So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were [betrothed, and legally promised] to marry his daughters, and said, "Get up, get out of this place, for the LORD is about to destroy this city!" But to his sons-in-law he appeared to be joking. 















###### 15 







When morning dawned, the angels urged Lot [to hurry], saying, "Get up! Take your wife and two daughters who are here [and go], or you will be swept away in the punishment of the city." 















###### 16 







But Lot hesitated _and_ lingered. The men took hold of his hand and the hand of his wife and the hands of his two daughters, because the LORD was merciful to him [for Abraham's sake]; and they brought him out, and left him outside the city [with his family]. 















###### 17 







When they had brought them outside, one [of the angels] said, "Escape for your life! Do not look behind you, or stop anywhere in the entire valley; escape to the mountains [of Moab], or you will be consumed _and_ swept away." 















###### 18 







But Lot said to them, "Oh no, [not that place] my lords! 















###### 19 







Please listen, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have magnified your lovingkindness (mercy) to me by saving my life; but I cannot escape to the mountains, because the disaster will overtake me and I will be killed. 















###### 20 







Now look, this town [in the distance] is near _enough for us_ to flee to, and it is small [with only a few people]. Please, let me escape there **(**is it not small?**)** so that my life will be saved." 















###### 21 







And the angel said to him, "Behold, I grant you this request also; I will not destroy this town of which you have spoken. 















###### 22 







Hurry and take refuge there, for I cannot do anything [to punish Sodom] until you arrive there." For this reason the town was named Zoar (few, small). 















###### 23 







The sun had risen over the earth when Lot came to Zoar. 















###### 24 







Then the LORD rained down brimstone (flaming sulfur) and fire on Sodom and on Gomorrah from the LORD out of heaven, 















###### 25 







and He overthrew (demolished, ended) those cities, and the entire valley, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and whatever grew on the ground. 















###### 26 







But Lot's wife, from behind him, [foolishly, longingly] looked [back toward Sodom in an act of disobedience], and she [^d]became a pillar of salt. 















###### 27 







Abraham started out early the next morning to the place where he [only the day before] had stood before the LORD; 















###### 28 







and he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the valley [of the Dead Sea]; and he saw, and behold, the smoke of [^e]the land went up like the smoke of a kiln (pottery furnace). 















###### 29 







Now when God ravaged _and_ destroyed the cities of the plain [of Siddim], He remembered Abraham [and for that reason], and He sent [Abraham's nephew] Lot out of the midst of the destruction, when He destroyed the cities in which Lot had lived. ## Lot Is Debased 















###### 30 







Now Lot went up from Zoar, and lived in the mountain together with his two daughters, for he was afraid to stay [any longer] in Zoar; and he lived in a cave with his two daughters. 















###### 31 







The firstborn said to the younger, "Our father is aging, and there is not a man on earth [available] to be intimate with us in the customary way [so that we may have children]. 















###### 32 







Come, let us make our father drunk with wine, and we will lie with him so that we may preserve our family through our father." 















###### 33 







So they gave their father wine that night, and the firstborn went in and lay with her father; and he did not know when she lay down or when she got up [because he was completely intoxicated]. 















###### 34 







Then the next day, the firstborn said to the younger, "Behold, I lay with my father last night; let us make him drunk with wine tonight also, and then you go in and lie with him, so that we may preserve our family through our father." 















###### 35 







So they gave their father wine that night also, and the younger got up and lay with him; and _again_ he did not know when she lay down or when she got up. 















###### 36 







Thus both the daughters of Lot conceived by their father. 















###### 37 







The firstborn gave birth to a son, and named him Moab (from father); he is the father of the Moabites to this day. 















###### 38 







The younger also gave birth to a son and named him Ben-ammi (son of my people); he is the father of the Ammonites to this day. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^d]: Genesis 19:26 Lot’s wife not only “looked back” to where her interests were, but perhaps lingered behind and was overtaken by the fire and brimstone; her dead body likely became continually encrusted with salt since this disaster occurred in the salt-rich area around the Dead Sea. [^e]: Genesis 19:28 Not only were Sodom and Gomorrah blazing ruins, but also Admah and Zeboiim (Deut 29:23; Hos 11:8), as well as all the towns in the Valley of Siddim; Zoar was the lone exception.

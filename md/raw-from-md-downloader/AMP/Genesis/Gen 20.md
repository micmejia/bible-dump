# Genesis 20

***
















###### 1 







Now Abraham journeyed from there toward the Negev (the South country), and settled between Kadesh and Shur; then he lived temporarily in Gerar. 















###### 2 







Abraham [^a]said [again] of Sarah his wife, "She is my sister." So [^b]Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took [^c]Sarah [into his harem]. 















###### 3 







But God came to Abimelech in a dream during the night, and said, "Behold, you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken [as your wife], for she is another man's wife." 















###### 4 







Now Abimelech had not yet come near her; so he said, "Lord, will you kill a people who are righteous _and_ innocent _and_ blameless [regarding Sarah]? 















###### 5 







Did Abraham not tell me, 'She is my sister?' And she herself said, 'He is my brother.' In the integrity of my heart and innocence of my hands I have done this." 















###### 6 







Then God said to him in the dream, "Yes, I know you did this in the integrity of your heart, for it was I who kept you back _and_ spared you from sinning against Me; therefore I did not give you an opportunity to touch her. 















###### 7 







So now return the man's wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you will live. But if you do not return _her_ [to him], know that you shall die, you and all who are yours (your household)." 















###### 8 







So Abimelech got up early in the morning and called all his servants and told them all these things; and the men were terrified. 















###### 9 







Then Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, "What have you done to us? And how have I offended you that you have brought on me and my kingdom a great sin? You have done to me what ought not to be done [to anyone]." 















###### 10 







And Abimelech said to Abraham, "What have you encountered _or_ seen [in us or our customs], that you have done this [unjust] thing?" 















###### 11 







Abraham said, "Because I thought, 'Surely there is no fear _or_ reverence of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.' 















###### 12 







Besides, she actually is my [half] sister; she is the daughter of my father [Terah], but not of my mother; and she became my wife. 















###### 13 







When God caused me to wander from my father's house, I said to her, 'This kindness _and_ loyalty you can show me: at every place we stop, say of me, "He is my brother."'" 















###### 14 







Then Abimelech took sheep and oxen and male and female slaves, and gave them to Abraham, and returned Sarah his wife to him [as God commanded]. 















###### 15 







So Abimelech said, "Behold, my land is before you; settle wherever you please." 















###### 16 







Then to Sarah he said, "Look, I have given this brother of yours a [^d]thousand pieces of silver; it is to compensate you [for all that has happened] _and_ to vindicate your honor before all who are with you; before all men you are cleared _and_ compensated." 















###### 17 







So Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech and his wife and his maids, and they _again_ gave birth to _children_, 















###### 18 







for the LORD had securely closed the wombs of all [the women] in Abimelech's household because of Sarah, Abraham's wife. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: Genesis 20:2 The word “Abimelech” may be a royal title instead of a proper name. In either case this man is probably the father or grandfather of Abimelech king of the Philistines encountered later by Isaac (26:1). [^c]: Genesis 20:2 Sarah was about ninety years old at this time. [^d]: Genesis 20:16 Perhaps about three years’ or a thousand days’ wages.

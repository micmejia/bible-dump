# Genesis 25

***
















###### 1 







Abraham took another wife, whose name was Keturah. 















###### 2 







She gave birth to Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. 















###### 3 







Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan. The sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim. 















###### 4 







The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the sons of Keturah. 















###### 5 







Now Abraham gave [^a]everything that he had to Isaac; 















###### 6 







but to the sons of his [^b]concubines [Hagar and Keturah], Abraham gave gifts while he was still living and he sent them to the east country, away from Isaac his son [of promise]. 















###### 7 







The days of Abraham's life were a hundred and seventy-five years. 















###### 8 







Then Abraham breathed his last and he died at a good old age, an old man who was satisfied [with life]; and he [^c]was gathered to his people [who had preceded him in death]. 















###### 9 







So his sons [^d]Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is east of Mamre, 















###### 10 







the field which Abraham purchased from the sons of Heth; there Abraham was buried with Sarah his wife. 















###### 11 







Now after the death of Abraham, God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac lived at Beer-lahai-roi. ## Descendants of Ishmael 















###### 12 







Now [^e]these are _the records of_ the descendants of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's maid, bore to Abraham; 















###### 13 







and these are the names of the [twelve] sons of Ishmael, named in the order of their births: Nebaioth, the firstborn of Ishmael, and Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, 















###### 14 







Mishma, Dumah, Massa, 















###### 15 







Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. 















###### 16 







These are the sons of Ishmael and these are their names, by their settlements, and by their encampments (sheepfolds); twelve princes (sheiks) according to their tribes. 















###### 17 







Ishmael lived a hundred and thirty-seven years; then he breathed his last and died, and [^f]was gathered to his people [who had preceded him in death]. 















###### 18 







Ishmael's sons (descendants) settled from Havilah to Shur which is [^g]east of Egypt as one goes toward Assyria; he [^h]settled [^i]opposite (east) of all his relatives. ## Isaac's Sons 















###### 19 







Now these are _the records of_ the descendants of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham was the father of Isaac. 















###### 20 







Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean (Syrian) of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Aramean. 















###### 21 







Isaac prayed to the LORD for his wife, because she was unable to conceive children; and the LORD granted his prayer and Rebekah his wife conceived [twins]. 















###### 22 







But the children struggled together within her [kicking and shoving one another]; and she said, "If it is so [that the LORD has heard our prayer], why then am I _this way_?" So she went to inquire of the LORD [praying for an answer]. 















###### 23 







The LORD said to her, "[The founders of] two nations are in your womb; And the separation of two nations has begun in your body; The one people shall be stronger than the other; And the older shall serve the younger." 















###### 24 







When her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb. 















###### 25 







The first came out reddish all over like a hairy garment; and they named him Esau (hairy). 















###### 26 







Afterward his brother came out, and his hand grasped Esau's heel, so he was named Jacob ([^j]one who grabs by the heel, supplanter). Isaac was sixty years old when Rebekah gave birth to them. 















###### 27 







When the boys grew up, Esau was an able _and_ skilled hunter, a man of the outdoors, but Jacob was a quiet _and_ peaceful man, living in tents. 















###### 28 







Now Isaac loved [and favored] Esau, because [^k]he enjoyed eating his game, but Rebekah loved [and favored] Jacob. 















###### 29 







Jacob had cooked [reddish-brown lentil] stew [one day], when Esau came from the field and was famished; 















###### 30 







and Esau said to Jacob, "Please, let me have a quick swallow of that red stuff there, because I am exhausted _and_ famished." For that reason Esau was [also] called Edom (Red). 















###### 31 







Jacob answered, "First sell me your [^l]birthright (the rights of a firstborn)." 















###### 32 







Esau said, "Look, I am about to die [if I do not eat soon]; so of what use is this birthright to me?" 















###### 33 







Jacob said, "Swear [an oath] to me today [that you are selling it to me for this food]"; so he swore [an oath] to him, and sold him his birthright. 















###### 34 







Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew; and he ate and drank, and got up and went on his way. In this way Esau scorned his birthright. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: Genesis 25:6 See note 22:24. [^c]: Genesis 25:8 This expression is a reference to the Old Testament belief in a life after death and to the expectation of a reunion with loved ones. [^d]: Genesis 25:9 Isaac was seventy-five and Ishmael nearly ninety years of age when their father died. Jacob and Esau were fifteen, and may have been present. [^e]: Genesis 25:12 Lit _these are the generations of_. [^f]: Genesis 25:17 See note v 8. [^g]: Genesis 25:18 Lit _before_. [^h]: Genesis 25:18 Lit _fell over against his brothers_. [^i]: Genesis 25:18 Or _in defiance_. [^j]: Genesis 25:26 Another meaning may be _protect_, i.e. _may God protect_. [^k]: Genesis 25:28 Lit _game was in his mouth_. [^l]: Genesis 25:31 In later times, this was the right of the firstborn to take over as head of the family and to receive a double share of the inheritance (cf Deut 21:17). The rewards given to Jacob appear to have been even greater (Gen 27:37). Furthermore, in Jewish tradition it was reported that before the tabernacle was set up, sacrifices were offered by the firstborn of a family.

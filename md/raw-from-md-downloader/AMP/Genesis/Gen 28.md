# Genesis 28

***
















###### 1 







So Isaac called Jacob and blessed him and charged him, and said to him, "You shall not marry one of the women of Canaan. 















###### 2 







[^a]Arise, go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel your mother's father; and take from there as a wife for yourself one of the daughters of Laban your mother's brother. 















###### 3 







May [^b]God Almighty bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you, so that you may become a [great] company of peoples. 















###### 4 







May He also give the blessing of Abraham to you and your descendants with you, that you may inherit the [promised] land of your sojournings, which He gave to Abraham." 















###### 5 







Then Isaac sent Jacob away, and he went to Paddan-aram, to Laban, son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau. 















###### 6 







Now Esau noticed that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him to Paddan-aram to take a wife for himself from there, and that as he blessed him he gave him a prohibition, saying, "You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan," 















###### 7 







and that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother and had gone to Paddan-aram. 















###### 8 







So Esau realized that [his two wives] the daughters of Canaan displeased Isaac his father; 















###### 9 







and [to appease his parents] Esau went to [the family of] Ishmael and took as his wife, in addition to the wives he [already] had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son, the sister of Nebaioth [Ishmael's firstborn son]. ## Jacob's Dream 















###### 10 







Now Jacob left Beersheba [never to see his mother again] and traveled toward Haran. 















###### 11 







And he came to a certain place and stayed overnight there because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones of the place, he put it under his head and lay down there [to sleep]. 















###### 12 







He dreamed that there was a ladder (stairway) placed on the earth, and the top of it reached [out of sight] toward heaven; and [he saw] the angels of God ascending and descending on it [going to and from heaven]. 















###### 13 







And behold, the LORD stood above _and_ around him and said, "I am the LORD, the God of Abraham your [father's] father and the God of Isaac; I will give to you and to your descendants the land [of promise] on which you are lying. 















###### 14 







Your descendants shall be as [countless as] the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west and the east and the north and the south; and all the families (nations) of the earth shall be blessed through you and your [^c]descendants. 















###### 15 







Behold, I am with you and will keep [careful watch over you and guard] you wherever you may go, and I will bring you back to this [promised] land; for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you." 















###### 16 







Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and he said, "Without any doubt the LORD is in this place, and I did not realize it." 















###### 17 







So he was afraid and said, "How fearful _and_ awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gateway to heaven." 















###### 18 







So Jacob got up early in the morning, and took the stone he had put under his head and he set it up as a pillar [that is, a monument to the vision in his dream], and he poured [olive] oil on the top of it [to [^d]consecrate it]. 















###### 19 







He named that place Bethel (the house of God); the previous name of that city was Luz (Almond Tree). 















###### 20 







Then Jacob made a vow (promise), saying, "If God will be with me and will keep me on this journey that I take, and will give me food to eat and clothing to wear, 















###### 21 







and if [He grants that] I return to my father's house in safety, then the LORD will be my God. 















###### 22 







This stone which I have set up as a pillar (monument, memorial) will be God's house [a sacred place to me], and of everything that You give me I will give the tenth to You [as an offering to signify my gratitude and dependence on You]." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

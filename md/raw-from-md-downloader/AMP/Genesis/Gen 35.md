# Genesis 35

***
















###### 1 







Then God said to Jacob, "Go up to Bethel and live there, and make an altar there to God, who appeared to you [in a distinct manifestation] when you fled [years ago] from Esau your brother." 















###### 2 







Then Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, "Get rid of the [idols and images of] foreign gods that are among you, and ceremonially purify yourselves and change [into fresh] clothes; 















###### 3 







then let us get up and go up to Bethel, and I will make an altar there to God, who answered me in the day of my distress and has been with me wherever I have gone." 















###### 4 







So they gave Jacob all the [idols and images of the] foreign gods they had and the rings which were in their ears [worn as charms against evil], and Jacob buried them under the [^a]oak tree near Shechem. 















###### 5 







As they journeyed, there was a great [supernatural] terror [sent from God] on the cities around them, and [for that reason] the Canaanites did not pursue the sons of Jacob. 















###### 6 







So Jacob came to Luz **(**that is, Bethel**)**, which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him. 















###### 7 







There he built an altar [to worship the LORD], and called the place El-bethel (God of the House of God), because there God had revealed Himself to him when he escaped from his brother. 















###### 8 







Now Deborah, [who once was] Rebekah's nurse, died and was buried below Bethel under the oak; and the name of it was called Allon-bacuth (Oak of Weeping). ## Jacob Is Named Israel 















###### 9 







Then God [in a visible manifestation] appeared to Jacob again when he came out of Paddan-aram, and declared a blessing on him. 















###### 10 







Again God said to him, "Your name is Jacob; You shall no longer be called Jacob, But Israel shall be your name." So he was called [^b]Israel. 















###### 11 







And God said to him, "I am [^c]God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply; A nation and a company of nations shall come from you, And kings shall be born of your [^d]loins. 















###### 12 







"The land which I gave Abraham and Isaac I will give to you, and to your descendants after you I will give the land." 















###### 13 







Then God ascended from Jacob in the place where He had spoken with him. 















###### 14 







Jacob set up a pillar (memorial, monument) in the place where he had talked with God, a pillar of stone, and he poured a drink offering [of wine] on it; he also poured oil on it [to declare it sacred for God's purpose]. 















###### 15 







So Jacob named the place where God had spoken with him, Bethel (the House of God). 















###### 16 







Then they journeyed from Bethel; and when there was still some distance to go to Ephrath (Bethlehem), Rachel began to give birth and had difficulty _and_ suffered severely. 















###### 17 







When she was in hard labor the midwife said to her, "Do not be afraid; you now have another son." 















###### 18 







And as her soul was departing, **(**for she died**)**, she named him Ben-oni (son of my sorrow); but his father called him Benjamin ([^e]son of the right hand). 















###### 19 







So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath **(**that is, Bethlehem**)**. 















###### 20 







Jacob set a pillar (memorial, monument) on her grave; that is the [^f]pillar of Rachel's grave to this day. 















###### 21 







Then Israel (Jacob) journeyed on and pitched his tent on the other side of the tower of Eder [the lookout point used by shepherds]. 















###### 22 







While Israel was living in that land, Reuben [his eldest son] went and lay with Bilhah his father's [^g]concubine, and Israel heard about it. ## The Sons of Israel Now Jacob had twelve sons-- 















###### 23 







The sons of Leah: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, then Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun; 















###### 24 







and the sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin; 















###### 25 







and the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's maid: Dan and Naphtali; 















###### 26 







and the sons of Zilpah, Leah's maid: Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob born to him in Paddan-aram. 















###### 27 







Jacob came to Isaac his father at Mamre of Kiriath-arba **(**that is, Hebron**)**, where Abraham and Isaac had lived temporarily. 















###### 28 







Now the days of Isaac were a hundred and eighty years. 















###### 29 







Isaac's spirit departed and he died and was [^h]gathered to his people [who had preceded him in death], an old man full of days (satisfied, fulfilled); his sons Esau and Jacob buried him [in the cave of Machpelah with his parents Abraham and Sarah]. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

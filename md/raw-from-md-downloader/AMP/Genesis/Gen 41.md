# Genesis 41

***
















###### 1 







Now it happened at the end of two full years that Pharaoh dreamed that he was standing by the [^a]Nile. 















###### 2 







And lo, there came up out of the Nile seven [healthy] cows, sleek _and_ handsome and fat; and they grazed in the reed grass [in a marshy pasture]. 















###### 3 







Then behold, seven other cows came up after them out of the Nile, ugly and gaunt _and_ raw-boned, and stood by the _fat_ cows on the bank of the Nile. 















###### 4 







Then the ugly and gaunt _and_ raw-boned cows ate up the seven sleek and fat cows. Then Pharaoh awoke. 















###### 5 







Then he fell asleep and dreamed a second time; and behold, seven ears of grain came up on a single stalk, plump and good. 















###### 6 







Then behold, seven ears [of grain], thin and dried up by the east wind, sprouted after them. 















###### 7 







Then the thin ears swallowed the seven plump and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and it was a dream. 















###### 8 







So when morning came his spirit was troubled _and_ disturbed and he sent and called for all the magicians and all the wise men of Egypt. And Pharaoh told them his dreams, but no one could interpret them to him. 















###### 9 







Then the chief cupbearer spoke to Pharaoh, saying, "I would mention my faults today. 















###### 10 







[Two years ago] Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and he put me in confinement in the house of the captain of the guard, both me and the chief baker. 















###### 11 







We dreamed a dream on the same night, he and I; each of us dreamed according to [the significance of] the interpretation of his own dream. 















###### 12 







Now there was with us [in the prison] a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted our dreams for us, to each man according to the significance of his own dream. 















###### 13 







And just as he interpreted [the dreams] for us, so it happened; I was restored to my office [as chief cupbearer], and the baker was hanged." ## Joseph Interprets 















###### 14 







Then Pharaoh sent and called for Joseph, and they hurriedly brought him out of the dungeon; and when Joseph shaved himself and changed his clothes [making himself presentable], he came to Pharaoh. 















###### 15 







Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I have dreamed a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it; and I have heard it said about you that you can understand a dream and interpret it." 















###### 16 







Joseph answered Pharaoh, "It is not in me [to interpret the dream]; God [not I] will give Pharaoh a [^b]favorable answer [through me]." 















###### 17 







So Pharaoh said to Joseph, "In my dream, I was standing on the bank of the Nile; 















###### 18 







and seven fat, sleek _and_ handsome cows came up out of the river, and they grazed in the reed grass [of a marshy pasture]. 















###### 19 







Lo, seven other cows came up after them, very ugly and gaunt [just skin and bones]; such emaciated animals as I have never seen in all the land of Egypt. 















###### 20 







And the lean and ugly cows ate up the first seven fat cows. 















###### 21 







Yet when they had devoured them, it could not be detected that they had eaten them, because they were still as thin _and_ emaciated as before. Then I awoke [but again I fell asleep and dreamed]. 















###### 22 







I saw in my [second] dream, seven ears [of grain], plump and good, growing on a single stalk; 















###### 23 







and lo, seven [other] ears, withered, thin, and scorched by the east wind, sprouted after them; 















###### 24 







and the thin ears devoured the seven good ears. Now I told this to the magicians _and_ soothsayers, but there was no one who could explain it [to me]." 















###### 25 







Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, "The [two] dreams are one [and the same and have one interpretation]; God has shown Pharaoh what He is about to do. 















###### 26 







The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years; the [two] dreams are one [and the same]. 















###### 27 







The seven thin and ugly cows that came up after them are seven years; and also the seven thin ears, dried up _and_ scorched by the east wind, they are seven years of famine _and_ hunger. 















###### 28 







This is the message just as I have told Pharaoh: God has shown Pharaoh what He is about to do. 















###### 29 







Listen very carefully: seven years of great abundance will come throughout all the land of Egypt; 















###### 30 







but afterward seven years of famine _and_ hunger will come, and [there will be such desperate need that] all the great abundance [of the previous years] will be forgotten in the land of Egypt [as if it never happened], and famine _and_ destitution will ravage _and_ destroy the land. 















###### 31 







So the great abundance will become forgotten in the land because of that subsequent famine, for it will be very severe. 















###### 32 







That the dream was repeated twice to Pharaoh [and in two different ways] indicates that this matter is fully determined _and_ established by God, and God will bring it to pass very quickly. 















###### 33 







So now let Pharaoh [prepare ahead and] look for a man discerning _and_ clear-headed and wise, and set him [in charge] over the land of Egypt [as governor under Pharaoh]. 















###### 34 







Let Pharaoh take action to appoint overseers _and_ officials over the land, and set aside one-fifth [of the produce] of the [entire] land of Egypt in the seven years of abundance. 















###### 35 







Let them gather [as a tax] all [of the fifth of] the food of these good years that are coming, and store up grain under the direction _and_ authority of Pharaoh, and let them guard the food [in fortified granaries] in the cities. 















###### 36 







That food shall be put [in storage] as a reserve for the land against the seven years of famine _and_ hunger which will occur in the land of Egypt, so that the land (people) will not be ravaged during the famine." 















###### 37 







Now the plan seemed good to Pharaoh and to all of his servants. ## Joseph Is Made a Ruler of Egypt 















###### 38 







So Pharaoh said to his servants, "Can we find a man like this [a man equal to Joseph], in whom is the divine spirit [of God]?" 















###### 39 







Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Since [your] God has shown you all this, there is no one as discerning _and_ clear-headed and wise as you are. 















###### 40 







You shall have charge over my house, and all my people shall [^c]be governed according to your word and pay respect [to you with reverence, submission, and obedience]; only in [matters of] the throne will I be greater than you [in Egypt]." 















###### 41 







Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "See, I have set you [in charge] over all the land of Egypt." 















###### 42 







Then Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand and put it on Joseph's hand, and dressed him in [official] vestments of fine linen and put a gold chain around his neck. 















###### 43 







He had him ride in his second chariot; and runners proclaimed before him, "[Attention,] bow the knee!" And he set him over all the land of Egypt. 















###### 44 







Moreover, Pharaoh said to Joseph, "_Though_ I am Pharaoh, yet without your permission shall no man raise his hand [to do anything] or set his foot [to go anywhere] in all the land of Egypt [all classes of people shall submit to your authority]." 















###### 45 







Then Pharaoh named Joseph [^d]Zaphenath-paneah; and he gave him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On (Heliopolis in Egypt), as his wife. And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt [to inspect and govern it]. 















###### 46 







Now Joseph [had been in Egypt thirteen years and] was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh, king of Egypt. Joseph departed from the presence of Pharaoh and went through all the land of Egypt [performing his duties]. 















###### 47 







In the seven abundant years the earth produced handfuls [for each seed planted]. 















###### 48 







And Joseph gathered all the [surplus] food of the seven [good] years in the land of Egypt and stored [enormous quantities of] the food in the cities. He stored away in every city the food [collected] from its own surrounding fields. 















###### 49 







Thus Joseph gathered _and_ stored up grain in great abundance like the sand of the sea, until he stopped counting it, for it could not be measured. ## The Sons of Joseph 















###### 50 







Now two sons were born to Joseph before the years of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, bore to him. 















###### 51 







Joseph named the firstborn Manasseh (causing to forget), for _he said_, "God has made me forget all my trouble _and_ hardship and all [the sorrow of the loss of] my father's household." 















###### 52 







He named the second [son] Ephraim (fruitfulness), for "God has caused me to be fruitful _and_ very successful in the land of my suffering." 















###### 53 







When the seven years of plenty came to an end in the land of Egypt, 















###### 54 







the seven years of famine began to come, just as Joseph had said [they would]; the famine was in all the [surrounding] lands, but in the land of Egypt there was bread (food). 















###### 55 







So when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried out to Pharaoh for food; and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, "Go to Joseph; do whatever he says to you." 















###### 56 







When the famine was _spread_ over all the land, Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold [surplus grain] to the Egyptians; and the famine grew [extremely] severe in the land of Egypt. 















###### 57 







And [the people of] all countries came to Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, because the famine was severe over all the [known] earth. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

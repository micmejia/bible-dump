# Genesis 42

***
















###### 1 







Now when Jacob (Israel) learned that there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons, "Why are you staring at one another [in bewilderment and not taking action]?" 















###### 2 







He said, "I have heard that there is grain in Egypt; go down there and buy [some] grain for us, so that we may live and not die [of starvation]." 















###### 3 







So ten of Joseph's brothers went down to buy grain in Egypt. 















###### 4 







But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph's [younger] brother, with his brothers, for he said, "I am afraid that some harm _or_ injury may come to him." 















###### 5 







So the sons of Israel came [to Egypt] to buy grain along with the others who were coming, for famine was in the land of Canaan _also_. 















###### 6 







Now Joseph was the ruler over the land, and he was the one who sold [grain] to all the people of the land; and Joseph's [half] brothers came and bowed down before him with _their_ faces to the ground. 















###### 7 







When Joseph saw his brothers he recognized them, but [hiding his identity] he treated them as strangers and [^a]spoke harshly to them. He said to them, "Where have you come from?" And they said, "From the land of Canaan, to buy food." 















###### 8 







Joseph recognized his brothers, but [^b]they did not recognize him. 















###### 9 







Joseph remembered the dreams he had dreamed about them, and said to them, "You are spies; you have come [with a malicious purpose] to observe the [^c]undefended parts of our land." 















###### 10 







But they said to him, "No, my lord, for your servants have [only] come to buy food. 















###### 11 







We are all the sons of one man; we are honest men, your servants are not spies." 















###### 12 







Yet he said to them, "No, you have come to see the undefended parts of our land." 















###### 13 







But they said, "Your servants are twelve brothers [in all], the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; please listen: the youngest is with our father today, and one is no longer alive." 















###### 14 







Joseph said to them, "It is as I said to you, you are spies. 















###### 15 







In this way you shall be tested: by the life of Pharaoh, you shall not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here! 















###### 16 







Send one of you [back home], and let him bring your brother [here], while [the rest of] you remain confined, so that your words may be tested, [to see] whether there is any truth in you [and your story]; or else, by the life of Pharaoh, certainly you are spies." 















###### 17 







Then Joseph put them all in prison for three days. 















###### 18 







Now Joseph said to them on the third day, "Do this and [you may] live, for I fear God: 















###### 19 







if you are honest men, let one of your brothers be confined in your [place here in] prison; but as for _the rest of_ you, go, carry grain for the famine in your households, 















###### 20 







but bring your youngest brother to me, so your words will be verified and you will not die." And they did so. 















###### 21 







And they said to one another, "Truly we are guilty regarding our brother [Joseph], because we saw the distress _and_ anguish of his soul when he pleaded with us [to let him go], yet we would not listen [to his cry]; so this distress _and_ anguish has come on us." 















###### 22 







Reuben answered them, "Did I not tell you, 'Do not sin against the boy'; and you would not listen? Now the accounting for his blood is required [of us for we are guilty of his death]." 















###### 23 







They did not know that Joseph understood [their conversation], because he spoke to them through an interpreter. 















###### 24 







He turned away from his brothers and [left the room and] wept; then he returned and talked with them, and took Simeon from them and bound him in front of them [to be kept as a hostage in Egypt]. 















###### 25 







Then Joseph gave orders [privately] that their bags be filled with grain, and that every man's money [used to pay for the grain] be put back in his sack, and that provisions be given to them for the journey. And so this was done for them. 















###### 26 







They loaded their donkeys with grain and left from there. 















###### 27 







And at the lodging place, as one _of them_ opened his sack to feed his donkey, he saw his money in the opening of his sack. 















###### 28 







And he said to his brothers, "My money has been returned! Here it is in my sack!" And their hearts sank, and they were afraid _and_ turned trembling to one another, saying, "What is this that God has done to us?" ## The Return to Canaan 















###### 29 







When they came to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan, they told him everything that had happened to them, saying, 















###### 30 







"The man who is the lord of the land spoke harshly to us, and took us for spies of the land. 















###### 31 







But we told him, 'We are honest men; we are not spies. 















###### 32 







We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is no longer alive, and the youngest is with our father today in the land of Canaan.' 















###### 33 







And the man, the lord of the country, said to us, 'By this [test] I will know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers here with me and take _grain for_ your starving households and go. 















###### 34 







Bring your youngest brother to me; then I will know that you are not spies, but that you are honest men. Then I will return your [imprisoned] brother [back] to you, and you may trade _and_ do business in the land.'" 















###### 35 







Now when they emptied their sacks, every man's bundle of money [paid to buy grain] was in his sack. When they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid. 















###### 36 







Jacob their father said to them, "You have bereaved me [by causing the loss] of my children. Joseph is no more, and Simeon is no more, and you would take Benjamin [from me]. All these things are [working] against me." 















###### 37 







Then Reuben spoke to his father, "You may put my two sons to death if I do not bring Benjamin back to you; put him in my care, and I will return him to you." 















###### 38 







But Jacob said, "My son shall not go down [to Egypt] with you; for his brother is dead, and he alone is left [of Rachel's children]. If any harm _or_ accident should happen to him on the journey you are taking, then you will bring my gray hair down to Sheol (the place of the dead) in sorrow." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

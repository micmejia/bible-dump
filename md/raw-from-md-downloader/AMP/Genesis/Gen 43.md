# Genesis 43

***
















###### 1 







Now the famine was very severe in the land [of Canaan]. 















###### 2 







And it happened that when the families of Jacob's sons had finished eating [all of] the grain which they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, "Go again, buy us a little food." 















###### 3 







But Judah said to him, "The man [representing Pharaoh] solemnly _and_ sternly warned us, saying, 'You will not see my face [again] unless your brother is with you.' 















###### 4 







If you will send our brother with us, we will go down [to Egypt] and buy you food. 















###### 5 







But if you will not send him, we will not go down there; for the man said to us, 'You will not see my face unless your brother is with you.'" 















###### 6 







And Israel (Jacob) said, "Why did you treat me so badly by telling the man that you had _another_ brother?" 















###### 7 







And they said, "The man asked us straightforward questions about ourselves and our relatives. He said, 'Is your father still alive? Have you _another_ brother?' And we [^a]answered him accordingly. How could we possibly know that he would say, 'Bring your brother down [here to Egypt]'?" 















###### 8 







Judah said to Israel his father, "Send the young man with me and we will get up and go [buy food], so that we may live and not die [of starvation], we as well as you and our little ones. 















###### 9 







I will be security (a guarantee) for him; [^b]you may hold me [personally] responsible for him. If I do not bring him [back] to you and place him [safely] before you, then let me bear the blame before you forever. 















###### 10 







For if we had not delayed like this, surely by now we would have returned the second time." 















###### 11 







Then their father Israel said to them, "If _it must be_ so, then do this; take some of the choicest products of the land in your sacks, and carry it as a present [of tribute] to the man [representing Pharaoh], a little balm and a little honey, aromatic spices _or_ gum, resin, pistachio nuts, and almonds. 















###### 12 







Take double the [amount of] money with you, and take back the money that was returned in the opening of your sacks; perhaps it was an oversight. 















###### 13 







Take your brother [Benjamin] also, and get up, and go to the man; 















###### 14 







and may [^c]God Almighty grant you compassion _and_ favor before the man, so that he will release to you your other brother [Simeon] and Benjamin. And as for me, if I am bereaved of my children [Joseph, Simeon, and Benjamin], I am bereaved." 















###### 15 







Then the men took the present, and they took double the [amount of] money with them, and Benjamin; then they left and went down to Egypt and stood before Joseph. ## Joseph Sees Benjamin 















###### 16 







When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, "Bring the men into the house, and kill an animal and make [a meal] ready; for the men will dine with me at noon." 















###### 17 







So the man did as Joseph said, and brought the men to Joseph's house. 















###### 18 







The men were afraid, because they were brought to Joseph's house; and [expecting the worst] they said, "It is because of the money that was returned in our sacks the first time [we came] that we are being brought in, so that he may find a reason to accuse us and assail us, and take us as slaves, and _seize_ our donkeys." 















###### 19 







So they approached the steward of Joseph's house, and talked with him at the entrance of the house, 















###### 20 







and said, "Oh, my lord, we indeed came down here the first time to buy food; 















###### 21 







and when we arrived at the inn [after leaving here], we opened our sacks and there was each man's money [with which he had paid for grain], in full, returned in the mouth of his sack. So we have brought it back [this time]. 















###### 22 







We have also brought down with us additional money to buy food; we do not know who put our money [back] in our sacks [last time]." 















###### 23 







But the steward [encouraged them and] said, "Peace be to you, do not be afraid; your God and the God of your father has [miraculously] given you treasure in your sacks. I [already] had your money [which you paid to us]." Then he brought Simeon out to them. 















###### 24 







Then the steward brought the men into Joseph's house and gave them water, and they washed [the dust off] their feet; and he gave their donkeys feed. 















###### 25 







So they prepared the present [of tribute] for Joseph before his arrival at noon; for they had heard that they were to eat a meal there. 















###### 26 







When Joseph came home, they brought into the house to him the present [of tribute] which they had with them and bowed to the ground before him. 















###### 27 







He asked them about their well-being, and said, "Is your old father well, of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?" 















###### 28 







And they answered, "Your servant our father is in good health; he is still alive." And they bowed down [their heads before Joseph] in respect. 















###### 29 







And he looked up and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's [only other] son, and said, "Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me?" And Joseph said, "God be gracious to you _and_ show you favor, my son." 















###### 30 







Then Joseph hurried out [of the room] because his heart was deeply touched over his brother, and he sought _privacy_ to weep; so he entered his chamber and wept there. 















###### 31 







Then he washed his face and came out, and, restraining himself, said, "Let the meal be served." 















###### 32 







So the servants served Joseph by himself [in honor of his rank], and his brothers by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because [according to custom] the Egyptians could not eat food with the Hebrews, for that is [^d]loathsome to the Egyptians. 















###### 33 







Now Joseph's brothers were seated [by the steward] before him [in the order of their birth]--the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth; and the men looked at one another in astonishment [because so much was known about them]. 















###### 34 







Joseph selected _and_ sent portions to them from his own table, but Benjamin's portion was five times as much as any of theirs. So they feasted and drank freely _and_ celebrated with him. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

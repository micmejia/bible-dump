# Genesis 46

***
















###### 1

###### 2 







And God spoke to Israel in visions of the night and said, "Jacob, Jacob!" And he said, "Here I am." 















###### 3 







And He said, "I am God, the God of your father; do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will make you (your descendants) a great nation there. 















###### 4 







I will go down with you to Egypt, and I will also surely bring you (your people) up again; and Joseph will put his hand on your eyes [to close them at the time of your death]." 















###### 5 







So Jacob set out from Beersheba; and the sons of Israel carried their father Jacob and their children and their wives in the wagons that Pharaoh had sent to carry him. 















###### 6 







And they took their livestock and the possessions which they had acquired in the land of Canaan and came to Egypt, Jacob and all his descendants with him.

All the persons who came with Jacob into Egypt--who were his direct descendants, not counting the wives of [Jacob or] Jacob's sons, were sixty-six persons in all,

and the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were two. All the persons of the house of Jacob [including Jacob, and [^d]Joseph and his sons], who came into Egypt, were seventy. 















###### 28 







Now Jacob (Israel) sent Judah ahead of him to Joseph, to direct him to Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen. 















###### 29 







Then Joseph prepared his chariot and went up to meet Israel his father in Goshen; as soon as he presented himself before him (authenticating his identity), he fell on his [father's] neck and wept on his neck a [very] long time. 















###### 30 







And Israel said to Joseph, "Now let me die [in peace], since I have seen your face [and know] that you are still alive."

and the men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of livestock; and they have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they have.' 















###### 33 







And it shall be that when Pharaoh calls you and says, 'What is your occupation?' 















###### 34 







you shall say, 'Your servants have been keepers of livestock from our youth until now, both we and our fathers [before us],' in order that you may live [separately and securely] in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is repulsive to the Egyptians." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^c]: Genesis 46:21 Benjamin was already the father of ten sons at the time he met Joseph in Egypt. Joseph was seventeen when his brothers sold him; he was in prison thirteen years; and he had been ruler of Egypt during the seven good years and through two years of the famine. So Joseph was thirty-nine years of age at this time, and Benjamin was only a few years younger. [^d]: Genesis 46:27 I.e. Joseph and his sons were included in the count even though they were already in Egypt.

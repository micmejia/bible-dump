# Genesis 6

***
















###### 1 







Now it happened, when men began to multiply on the face of the land, and daughters were born to them, 















###### 2 







that the [^a]sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful _and_ desirable; and they took wives for themselves, whomever they chose _and_ desired. 















###### 3 







Then the LORD said, "My Spirit shall not strive _and_ remain with man forever, because he is indeed flesh [sinful, corrupt--given over to sensual appetites]; nevertheless his days shall yet be [^b]a hundred and twenty years." 















###### 4 







There were Nephilim (men of stature, notorious men) on the earth in those days--and also afterward--when the sons of God lived with the daughters of men, and they gave birth to their _children_. These were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown (great reputation, fame). 















###### 5 







The LORD saw that the wickedness (depravity) of man was great on the earth, and that every imagination _or_ intent of the thoughts of his heart were only evil continually. 















###### 6 







The LORD [^c]regretted that He had made mankind on the earth, and He was [deeply] grieved in His heart. 















###### 7 







So the LORD said, "I will destroy (annihilate) mankind whom I have created from the surface of the earth--not only man, but the animals and the crawling things and the birds of the air--because it [deeply] grieves Me [to see mankind's sin] _and_ I regret that I have made them." 















###### 8 







But Noah found favor _and_ grace in the eyes of the LORD. 















###### 9 







These are _the records of_ the generations (family history) of Noah. Noah was a righteous man [one who was just and had right standing with God], blameless in his [evil] generation; Noah walked (lived) [in habitual fellowship] with God. 















###### 10 







Now Noah became the father of three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. 















###### 11 







The [population of the] earth was corrupt [absolutely depraved--spiritually and morally putrid] in God's sight, and the land was filled with violence [desecration, infringement, outrage, assault, and lust for power]. 















###### 12 







God looked on the earth and saw how debased _and_ degenerate it was, for all humanity had corrupted their way on the earth _and_ lost their true direction. 















###### 13 







God said to Noah, "I intend to make an end of all that lives, for through men the land is filled with violence; and behold, I am about to [^d]destroy them together with the land. 















###### 14 







Make yourself an [^e]ark of [^f]gopher wood; make in it rooms (stalls, pens, coops, nests, cages, compartments) and [^g]coat it inside and out with pitch (bitumen). 















###### 15 







This is the way you are to make it: the length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, its width fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits (450' x 75' x 45'). 















###### 16 







You shall make a [^h]window [for light and ventilation] for the ark, and finish it to at least a cubit (eighteen inches) from the top--and set the [entry] door of the ark in its side; and you shall make it with lower, second and third decks. 















###### 17 







For behold, I, even I, will bring a flood of waters on the earth, to destroy all life under the heavens in which there is the breath _and_ spirit of life; everything that is on the land shall die. 















###### 18 







But I will establish My covenant (solemn promise, formal agreement) with you; and you shall come into the ark--you and your [three] sons and your wife, and your sons' wives with you. 















###### 19 







And of every living thing [found on land], you shall bring two of every kind into the ark, to keep them alive with you; they shall be male and female. 















###### 20 







Of fowls _and_ birds according to their kind, of animals according to their kind, of every crawling thing of the ground according to its kind--two of every kind shall come to you to keep them alive. 















###### 21 







Also take with you every kind of food that is edible, and you shall collect _and_ store it; and it shall be food for you and for them." 















###### 22 







So Noah did this; according to all that God commanded him, that is what he did. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: Genesis 6:3 This may refer to the time given man to repent before the flood, or to the normative human life span after the flood. [^c]: Genesis 6:6 The expressions of regret and grief seen here do not mean that God acknowledged the creation of man as a mistake on His part. God is omniscient, knowing all things (Ps 139:16) and He knew that mankind would come into sin and wickedness. God grieved over the sin of man because it was appropriate for Him to do so. [^d]: Genesis 6:13 Enoch (the descendant of Seth, not Cain) had warned these people (Jude 14, 15); Noah had preached righteousness to them (2 Pet 2:5); and God’s Spirit had been struggling with them (Gen 6:3). Yet they had rejected God. [^e]: Genesis 6:14 The word “ark” comes from a Latin word (_arca_) for a box or chest. The design of the ark matched its purpose, which was not to travel through the water efficiently, but to be stable and have the greatest possible capacity for cargo. Also, such a vessel could be constructed relatively quickly, because there would be no need to form the wood used for the hull into efficient curves to maximize speed. [^f]: Genesis 6:14 The type of wood is unknown. The name of the wood is a transliteration—not a translation—of the Hebrew, with no connection to the English word “gopher.” [^g]: Genesis 6:14 This prevented water from seeping into the ark through the seams between the wooden planks, and may also have served to protect the wood from becoming saturated with water. Coating the ark with pitch on the outside as well as the inside was very practical. One of the worst jobs on the old wooden ships was to re-coat the inside bottom of the hull when water had seeped in, because the crewman had to quickly pave hot pitch on the hull under the water, which cooled the pitch as he worked and made the job all the more difficult—thus the nautical saying, “the devil (referring to the seam in the hull planking) to pay (i.e. pave with pitch).” The problem was eliminated or minimized on the ark, but Noah, due to his complete inexperience with sea-going vessels, would not even have known about the potential problem himself. It was imperative for him to have absolute faith in God, and to follow God’s directions word for word. [^h]: Genesis 6:16 Or _roof_.

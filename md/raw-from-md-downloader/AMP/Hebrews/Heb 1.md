# Hebrews 1

***
















###### 1 







God, having spoken to the fathers long ago in [the voices and writings of] the prophets in many separate revelations [each of which set forth a portion of the truth], and in many ways, 















###### 2 







has in these last days spoken [with finality] to us in [the person of One who is by His character and nature] His Son [namely Jesus], whom He appointed heir _and_ lawful owner of all things, through whom also He created the universe [that is, the universe as a space-time-matter continuum]. 















###### 3 







The Son is the radiance _and_ only expression of the glory of [our awesome] God [reflecting God's [^a]Shekinah glory, the Light-being, the brilliant light of the divine], and the exact representation _and_ perfect imprint of His [Father's] essence, and upholding _and_ maintaining _and_ propelling all things [the entire physical and spiritual universe] by His powerful word [carrying the universe along to its predetermined goal]. When He [Himself and no other] had [by offering Himself on the cross as a sacrifice for sin] accomplished purification from sins _and_ established our freedom from guilt, He sat down [revealing His completed work] at the right hand of the Majesty on high [revealing His Divine authority], 















###### 4 







having become as much superior to angels, since He has inherited a more excellent _and_ glorious [^b]name than they [that is, Son--the name above all names]. 















###### 5 







For to which of the angels did the Father ever say, "You are My Son, Today I have begotten (fathered) You [established You as a Son, with kingly dignity]"? And again [did He ever say to the angels], "I shall be a Father to Him And He shall be a Son to Me"? 















###### 6 







[^c]And when He again brings the firstborn [highest-ranking Son] into the world, He says, "And all the angels of God are to worship Him." 















###### 7 







And concerning the angels He says, "Who makes His angels winds, And His ministering servants flames of fire [to do His bidding]." 















###### 8 







But about the Son [the Father says to Him], "Your throne, [^d]O God, is forever and ever, And the [^e]scepter of [absolute] righteousness is the scepter of [^f]His kingdom. 















###### 9 







"You have loved righteousness [integrity, virtue, uprightness in purpose] and have hated lawlessness [injustice, sin]. Therefore God, Your God, Has anointed You With the oil of gladness above Your companions." 















###### 10 







And, "[^g]You, Lord, laid the foundation of the earth in the beginning, And the heavens are the works of Your hands; 















###### 11 







They will perish, but You remain [forever and ever]; And they will all wear out like a garment, 















###### 12 







And like a robe You will roll them up; Like a garment they will be changed. But [^h]You are the same [forever], And Your years will never end." 















###### 13 







But to which of the angels has the Father ever said, "Sit at My right hand [together with me in royal dignity], Until I make your enemies A footstool for your feet [in triumphant conquest]"? 















###### 14 







Are not all the angels ministering spirits sent out [by God] to serve (accompany, protect) those who will inherit salvation?

[^b]: Hebrews 1:4 In Greek “name” occurs last in this verse to emphasize that Jesus alone bears the name _Son_. No angel is superior to the Son. [^c]: Hebrews 1:6 Most likely a reference to the second coming of Christ when He will be acknowledged as divine and worshiped as the Son of God. Another view suggests that this may be a reference to His incarnation as Jesus of Nazareth. [^d]: Hebrews 1:8 The Son is recognized as deity by being addressed by the Father as “God.” [^e]: Hebrews 1:8 I.e. symbol of authority. [^f]: Hebrews 1:8 Late mss read _Your_. [^g]: Hebrews 1:10 The deity of Jesus is acclaimed by the designation “You, Lord.” [^h]: Hebrews 1:12 Since He is deity, the eternality of Jesus is recognized.

# Hebrews 10

***
















###### 1 







For since the Law has only a shadow [just a pale representation] of the good things to come--not the very image of those things--it can never, by offering the same sacrifices continually year after year, make [^a]perfect those who approach [its altars]. 















###### 2 







For if it were otherwise, would not these sacrifices have stopped being offered? For the worshipers, having once [for all time] been cleansed, would no longer have a consciousness of sin. 















###### 3 







But [as it is] these [continual] _sacrifices_ bring a fresh reminder of sins [to be atoned for] year after year, 















###### 4 







for it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins. 















###### 5 







Therefore, when Christ enters into the world, He says, "Sacrifice and offering You have not desired, But [instead] You have prepared a body for Me [to offer]; 















###### 6 







In burnt offerings and _sacrifices_ for sin You have taken no delight. 















###### 7 







"Then I said, 'Behold, I have come To do Your will, O God-- [To fulfill] what is written of Me in the scroll of the book.'" 















###### 8 







After saying [in the citation] above, "You have neither desired, nor have You taken delight in sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and _sacrifices_ for sin" **(**which are offered according to the Law**)** 















###### 9 







then He said, "Behold, I have come to do Your will." [And so] He does away with the first [covenant as a means of atoning for sin based on animal sacrifices] so that He may inaugurate _and_ establish the second [covenant by means of obedience]. 















###### 10 







And in accordance with this will [of God] we [who believe in the message of salvation] have been sanctified [that is, set apart as holy for God and His purposes] through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed) once for all. 















###### 11 







Every priest stands [at his altar of service] ministering daily, offering the same sacrifices over and over, which are never able [^b]to strip away sins [that envelop and cover us]; 















###### 12 







whereas Christ, having offered the one sacrifice [the all-sufficient sacrifice of Himself] for sins for all time, sat down [signifying the completion of atonement for sin] at the right hand of God [the position of honor], 















###### 13 







waiting from that time onward until his enemies are made a footstool for His feet. 















###### 14 







For by the one offering He has perfected forever _and_ completely cleansed those who are being sanctified [bringing each believer to spiritual completion and maturity]. 















###### 15 







And the Holy Spirit also adds His testimony to us [in confirmation of this]; for after having said, 















###### 16 







"This is the covenant that I will make with them After those days, says the Lord: I will imprint My laws upon their heart, And on their mind I will inscribe them [producing an inward change]," _He then says_, 















###### 17 







"And their sins and their lawless acts I will remember no more [no longer holding their sins against them]." 















###### 18 







Now where there is [absolute] forgiveness _and_ complete cancellation of the penalty of these things, there is no longer any offering [to be made to atone] for sin. ## A New and Living Way 















###### 19 







Therefore, [^c]believers, since we have confidence _and_ full freedom to enter the Holy Place [the place where God dwells] by [means of] the blood of Jesus, 















###### 20 







by this new and living way which He initiated _and_ opened for us through the veil [as in the Holy of Holies], that is, through His flesh, 















###### 21 







and since we have a great _and_ wonderful Priest [Who rules] over the house of God, 















###### 22 







let us approach [God] with a true _and_ sincere heart in unqualified assurance of faith, having had our hearts sprinkled _clean_ from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water. 















###### 23 







Let us seize _and_ hold tightly the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is reliable _and_ trustworthy _and_ faithful [to His word]; 















###### 24 







and let us consider [thoughtfully] how we may encourage one another to love and to do good deeds, 















###### 25 







not forsaking our meeting together [as believers for worship and instruction], as is the habit of some, but encouraging _one another_; and all the more [faithfully] as you see the day [of Christ's return] approaching. ## Christ or Judgment 















###### 26 







For if we go on willfully _and_ deliberately sinning after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice [to atone] for our sins [that is, no further offering to anticipate], 















###### 27 







but a kind of awful _and_ terrifying expectation of [divine] judgment and the fury of a fire _and_ burning wrath which will consume the adversaries [those who put themselves in opposition to God]. 















###### 28 







Anyone who has ignored _and_ set aside the Law of Moses is put to death without mercy on _the testimony of_ two or three witnesses. 















###### 29 







How much greater punishment do you think he will deserve who has rejected _and_ trampled under foot the Son of God, and has considered unclean _and_ common the blood of the covenant that [^d]sanctified him, and has insulted the Spirit of grace [who imparts the unmerited favor and blessing of God]? 















###### 30 







For we know Him who said, "Vengeance is Mine [retribution and the deliverance of justice rest with Me], I will repay [the wrongdoer]." And again, "The Lord will judge His people." 















###### 31 







It is a fearful _and_ terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God [incurring His judgment and wrath]. 















###### 32 







But remember the earlier days, when, after being [spiritually] enlightened, you [patiently] endured a great conflict of sufferings, 















###### 33 







sometimes by being made a spectacle, publicly exposed to insults and distress, and sometimes by becoming companions with those who were so treated. 















###### 34 







For you showed sympathy _and_ deep concern for those who were imprisoned, and you joyfully accepted the [unjust] seizure of your belongings _and_ the confiscation of your property, conscious of the fact that you have a better possession and a lasting one [prepared for you in heaven]. 















###### 35 







Do not, therefore, fling away your [fearless] confidence, for it has a glorious _and_ great reward. 















###### 36 







For you have need of patient endurance [to bear up under difficult circumstances without compromising], so that when you have carried out the will of God, you may receive _and_ enjoy to the full what is promised. 















###### 37 







For yet in a very little while, He who is coming will come, and will not delay. 















###### 38 







But My righteous one [the one justified by faith] shall live by faith [respecting man's relationship to God and trusting Him]; And if he draws back [shrinking in fear], My soul has no delight in him. 















###### 39 







But [^e]our way is not that of those who shrink back to destruction, but [we are] of those who believe [relying on God through faith in Jesus Christ, the Messiah] _and_ by this confident faith preserve the soul. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

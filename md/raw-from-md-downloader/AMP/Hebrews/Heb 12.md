# Hebrews 12

***
















###### 1 







Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of [^a]witnesses [who by faith have testified to the truth of God's absolute faithfulness], stripping off every unnecessary weight and the sin which so easily _and_ cleverly entangles us, let us run with endurance _and_ active persistence the race that is set before us, 















###### 2 







[looking away from all that will distract us and] focusing our eyes on Jesus, who is the Author and Perfecter of faith [the first incentive for our belief and the One who brings our faith to maturity], who for the joy [of accomplishing the goal] set before Him endured the cross, [^b]disregarding the shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God [revealing His deity, His authority, and the completion of His work]. 















###### 3 







Just consider _and_ meditate on Him who endured from sinners such bitter hostility against Himself [consider it all in comparison with your trials], so that you will not grow weary and lose heart. ## A Father's Discipline 















###### 4 







You have not yet struggled to the point of shedding blood in your striving against sin; 















###### 5 







and you have [^c]forgotten the divine word of encouragement which is addressed to you as sons, "My son, do not make light of the discipline of the Lord, And do not lose heart _and_ give up when you are corrected by Him; 















###### 6 







For the Lord disciplines _and_ corrects those whom He loves, And He punishes every son whom He receives _and_ welcomes [to His heart]." 















###### 7 







You must submit to [correction for the purpose of] discipline; God is dealing with you as with sons; for [^d]what son is there whom his father does not discipline? 















###### 8 







Now if you are exempt from correction _and_ without discipline, in which all [of God's children] share, then you are illegitimate children and not sons [at all]. 















###### 9 







Moreover, we have had earthly fathers who disciplined us, and we submitted _and_ respected them [for training us]; shall we not much more willingly submit to the Father of [^e]spirits, and live [by learning from His discipline]? 















###### 10 







For our earthly fathers disciplined us for only a short time as seemed best to them; but He _disciplines us_ for our good, so that we may share His holiness. 















###### 11 







For the time being no discipline brings joy, but seems sad _and_ painful; yet to those who have been trained by it, afterwards it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness [right standing with God and a lifestyle and attitude that seeks conformity to God's will and purpose]. 















###### 12 







So then, strengthen hands that are weak and knees that tremble. 















###### 13 







Cut through _and_ make smooth, straight paths for your feet [that are safe and go in the right direction], so that _the leg_ which is lame may not be put out of joint, but rather may be healed. 















###### 14 







_Continually_ pursue peace with everyone, and the sanctification without which no one will [ever] see the Lord. 















###### 15 







See to it that no one falls short of God's grace; that no root of resentment springs up and causes trouble, and by it many be defiled; 















###### 16 







and [see to it] that no one is immoral or godless like Esau, who sold his own birthright for a _single_ meal. 















###### 17 







For you know that later on, when he wanted [to regain title to] his inheritance of the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no opportunity for repentance [there was no way to repair what he had done, no chance to recall the choice he had made], even though he sought for it with [bitter] tears. ## Contrast of Sinai and Zion 















###### 18 







For you have not come [as did the Israelites in the wilderness] to _a mountain_ that can be touched and to a blazing fire, and to gloom and darkness and a raging windstorm, 















###### 19 







and to the blast of a trumpet and a sound of words [such that] those who heard it begged that nothing more be said to them. 















###### 20 







For they could not bear the command, "If even a wild animal touches the mountain, it will be stoned [to death]." 















###### 21 







In fact, so terrifying was the sight, that Moses said, "I am filled with fear and trembling." 















###### 22 







But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels [in festive gathering], 















###### 23 







and to the general assembly and assembly of the firstborn who are registered [as citizens] in heaven, and to God, who is Judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous (the redeemed in heaven) who have been made perfect [bringing them to their final glory], 















###### 24 







and to Jesus, the Mediator of a new covenant [uniting God and man], and to the sprinkled blood, which speaks [of mercy], a better _and_ nobler _and_ more gracious message than _the blood_ of Abel [which cried out for vengeance]. ## The Unshaken Kingdom 















###### 25 







See to it that you do not refuse [to listen to] Him who is speaking [to you now]. For if those [sons of Israel] did not escape when they refused [to listen to] him who warned them on earth [revealing God's will], how much less will we _escape_ if we turn our backs on Him who warns from heaven? 















###### 26 







His voice shook the earth [at Mount Sinai] then, but now He has given a promise, saying, "Yet once more I will shake not only the earth, but also the [starry] heaven." 















###### 27 







Now this [expression], "Yet once more," indicates the removal _and_ final transformation of all those things which can be shaken--that is, of that which has been created--so that those things which cannot be shaken may remain. 















###### 28 







Therefore, since we receive a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us show gratitude, and offer to God pleasing service _and_ acceptable worship with reverence and awe; 















###### 29 







for our God is [indeed] a consuming fire. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

See 11:2, 39. [^b]: Hebrews 12:2 Sometimes the public shame of the cross is overlooked when one thinks of the pain and agony inflicted by it, but in the Roman Empire crucifixion was a shameful and disgraceful way to die, a form of capital punishment from which Roman citizens were exempt; and in Roman comedy it was used in a curse: “Go to a bad cross!” [^c]: Hebrews 12:5 Or _have you forgotten_. [^d]: Hebrews 12:7 Or _who is a son whom_. [^e]: Hebrews 12:9 The meaning seems to be that God is the Father of that which is spiritual as well as that which is physical.

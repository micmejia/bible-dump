# Hebrews 2

***
















###### 1 







[^a]For this reason [that is, because of God's final revelation in His Son Jesus and because of Jesus' superiority to the angels] we must pay much closer attention than ever to the things that we have heard, so that we do not [in any way] drift away from truth. 















###### 2 







For if the message given [^b]through angels [the Law given to Moses] was authentic _and_ unalterable, and every violation and disobedient act received an appropriate penalty, 















###### 3 







how will we escape [the penalty] if we ignore such a great salvation [the gospel, the new covenant]? For it was spoken at first by the Lord, and it was confirmed to us _and_ proved authentic by those who _personally_ heard [Him speak], 















###### 4 







[and besides this evidence] God also testifying with them [confirming the message of salvation], both by signs and wonders and by various miracles [carried out by Jesus and the apostles] and by [granting to believers the] gifts of the Holy Spirit according to His own will. ## Earth Subject to Man 















###### 5 







It was not to angels that God subjected the [inhabited] world of the future [when Christ reigns], about which we are speaking. 















###### 6 







But one has [solemnly] testified somewhere [in Scripture], saying, "What is man, that You are mindful of him, Or the son of man, that You graciously care for him? 















###### 7 







"You have made him for a little while lower [in status] than the angels; You have crowned him with glory and honor, [^c]And set him over the works of Your hands; 















###### 8 







You have put all things in subjection under his feet [confirming his supremacy]." Now in putting all things in subjection to man, He left nothing outside his control. But at present we do not yet see all things subjected to him. ## Jesus Briefly Humbled 















###### 9 







But we do see Jesus, who was made lower than the angels for a little while [by taking on the limitations of humanity], crowned with glory and honor because of His suffering of death, so that by the grace of God [extended to sinners] He might experience death for [the sins of] everyone. 















###### 10 







For it was fitting for God [that is, an act worthy of His divine nature] that He, for whose sake are all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, should make the [^d]author _and_ founder of their salvation perfect through suffering [bringing to maturity the human experience necessary for Him to be perfectly equipped for His office as High Priest]. 















###### 11 







Both Jesus who sanctifies and those who are sanctified [that is, spiritually transformed, made holy, and set apart for God's purpose] are all from one _Father_; for this reason He is not ashamed to call them [^e]brothers and sisters, 















###### 12 







saying, "I will declare Your (the Father's) name to My brethren (believers), In the midst of the congregation I will sing Your praise." 















###### 13 







And again [[^f]He says], "My trust _and_ confident hope will be placed in Him." And again, "Here I am, I and the children whom God has given Me." 















###### 14 







Therefore, since [these His] children share in flesh and blood [the physical nature of mankind], He Himself in a similar manner also shared in the same [physical nature, but without sin], so that through [experiencing] death He might make powerless (ineffective, impotent) him who had the power of death--that is, the devil-- 















###### 15 







and [that He] might free all those who through [the haunting] fear of death were held in slavery throughout their lives. 















###### 16 







For, as we all know, He (Christ) does not take hold of [the fallen] angels [to give them a helping hand], but He does take hold of [the fallen] descendants of Abraham [extending to them His hand of deliverance]. 















###### 17 







Therefore, _it was essential that_ He had to be made like His brothers (mankind) in every respect, so that He might [by experience] become a merciful and faithful High Priest in things related to God, to make atonement (propitiation) for the people's sins [thereby wiping away the sin, satisfying divine justice, and providing a way of reconciliation between God and mankind]. 















###### 18 







Because He Himself [in His humanity] has suffered in being tempted, He is able to help _and_ provide immediate assistance to those who are being tempted _and_ exposed to suffering. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: Hebrews 2:2 It was a tradition in Judaism that angels, whom the Jews highly regarded, had an important role in God’s giving of the Law to Moses. See Acts 7:38; Gal 3:19. [^c]: Hebrews 2:7 Two early mss do not contain “And...hands.” [^d]: Hebrews 2:10 Or _pioneer, originator, champion_. [^e]: Hebrews 2:11 Lit _brethren_. [^f]: Hebrews 2:13 By placing these two OT quotations on the lips of Jesus the author illustrates: 1) his high view of Scripture, and 2) that he views even written Scripture as the words of Jesus.

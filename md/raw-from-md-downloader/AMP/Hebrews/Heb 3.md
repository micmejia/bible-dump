# Hebrews 3

***
















###### 1 







Therefore, [^a]holy brothers and sisters, who share in the heavenly calling, [thoughtfully and attentively] consider the Apostle and High Priest whom we confessed [as ours when we accepted Him as Savior], namely, [^b]Jesus; 















###### 2 







He was faithful to Him who appointed Him [Apostle and High Priest], as Moses also was _faithful_ in all God's house. 















###### 3 







Yet Jesus has been considered worthy of much greater glory _and_ honor than Moses, just as the builder of a house has more honor than the house. 















###### 4 







For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God. 















###### 5 







Now Moses was faithful in [the administration of] all God's house, [but only] as a _ministering_ servant, [his ministry serving] as a testimony of the things which were to be spoken afterward [the revelation to come in Christ]; 















###### 6 







but Christ is faithful as a Son over His [Father's] house. And we are His house if we hold fast our confidence and sense of triumph in our hope [in Christ]. 















###### 7 







Therefore, just as the Holy Spirit says, "Today if you hear His voice, 















###### 8 







Do not harden your hearts as [your fathers did] in the rebellion [of Israel at [^c]Meribah], On the day of testing in the wilderness, 















###### 9 







Where your fathers tried Me by testing [My forbearance and tolerance], And saw My works for forty years [And found I stood their test]. 















###### 10 







"Therefore I was angered with this generation, And I said, 'They always go astray in their heart, And they did not know My ways [nor become progressively better and more intimately acquainted with them]'; 















###### 11 







So I swore [an oath] in My wrath, 'They shall not enter My rest [the promised land].'" ## The Peril of Unbelief 















###### 12 







Take care, brothers and sisters, that there not be in any one of you a wicked, unbelieving [^d]heart [which refuses to trust and rely on the Lord, a heart] that turns away from the living God. 















###### 13 







But continually encourage one another every day, as long as it is called "Today" [and there is an opportunity], so that none of you will be hardened [into settled rebellion] by the deceitfulness of sin [its cleverness, delusive glamour, and sophistication]. 















###### 14 







For we [believers] have become partakers of Christ [sharing in all that the Messiah has for us], if only we hold firm our newborn confidence [which originally led us to Him] until the end, 















###### 15 







while it is said, "Today [while there is still opportunity] if you hear His voice, Do not harden your heart, as when they provoked Me [in the rebellion in the desert at Meribah]." 















###### 16 







For who were they who heard and yet provoked _Him_ [with rebellious acts]? Was it not all those who came out of Egypt led by Moses? 















###### 17 







And with whom was He angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose dead bodies were scattered in the desert? 















###### 18 







And to whom did He swear [an oath] that they would not enter His rest, but to those who disobeyed [those who would not listen to His word]? 















###### 19 







So we see that they were not able to enter [into His rest--the promised land] because of unbelief _and_ an unwillingness to trust in God. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Hebrews 4

***
















###### 1 







Therefore, while the promise of entering His rest still remains _and_ is freely offered today, let us fear, in case any one of you may seem to come short of reaching it _or_ think he has come too late. 















###### 2 







For indeed we have had the good news [of salvation] preached to us, just as the Israelites also [when the good news of the promised land came to them]; but the message they heard did not benefit them, because it was not united with faith [in God] by those who heard. 















###### 3 







For we who believe [that is, we who personally trust and confidently rely on God] enter that rest [so we have His inner peace now because we are confident in our salvation, and assured of His power], just as He has said, "As I swore [an oath] in My wrath, They shall not enter My rest," [this He said] although His works were [^a]completed from the foundation of the world [waiting for all who would believe]. 















###### 4 







For somewhere [in Scripture] He has said this about the seventh day: "And God rested on the seventh day from all His works"; 















###### 5 







and again in this, "They shall not enter My rest." 















###### 6 







Therefore, since the promise remains for some to enter His rest, and those who formerly had the good news preached to them failed to [grasp it and did not] enter because of [their unbelief evidenced by] disobedience, 















###### 7 







He again sets a definite day, [a new] "Today," [providing another opportunity to enter that rest by] saying through David after so long a time, just as has been said before [in the words already quoted], "Today if you hear His voice, Do not harden your hearts." 















###### 8 







[This mention of a rest was not a reference to their entering into Canaan.] For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not speak about another day [of opportunity] after that. 















###### 9 







So there remains a [full and complete] Sabbath rest for the people of God. 















###### 10 







For the one who has once entered His rest has also rested from [the weariness and pain of] his [human] labors, just as God rested from [those labors uniquely] His own. 















###### 11 







Let us therefore make every effort to enter that rest [of God, to know and experience it for ourselves], so that no one will fall by _following_ the same example of disobedience [as those who died in the wilderness]. 















###### 12 







For the word of God is living and active _and_ full of power [making it operative, energizing, and effective]. It is sharper than any two-edged [^b]sword, penetrating as far as the division of the [^c]soul and spirit [the completeness of a person], and of both joints and marrow [the deepest parts of our nature], exposing _and_ judging the very thoughts and intentions of the heart. 















###### 13 







And not a creature exists that is concealed from His sight, but all things are open _and_ exposed, and revealed to the eyes of Him with whom we have to give account. 















###### 14 







Inasmuch then as we [believers] have a great High Priest who has [already ascended and] passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession [of faith and cling tenaciously to our absolute trust in Him as Savior]. 















###### 15 







For we do not have a High Priest who is unable to sympathize _and_ understand our weaknesses _and_ temptations, but One who has been tempted [knowing exactly how it feels to be human] in every respect as _we are, yet_ without [committing any] sin. 















###### 16 







Therefore let us [with privilege] approach the throne of grace [that is, the throne of God's gracious favor] with confidence _and_ without fear, so that we may receive mercy [for our failures] and find [His amazing] grace to help in time of need [an appropriate blessing, coming just at the right moment]. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

In human terms this expression is used when a lawyer completes his presentation in a court of law; he “rests” his case—everything is in evidence, there is nothing left to present. [^b]: Hebrews 4:12 In addition to “sword,” the word in Greek was used for the knife used by the priests to slit the throats of the sacrificial lambs and for the knife (scalpel) used by a surgeon. [^c]: Hebrews 4:12 “soul and spirit” used here to emphasize the whole person, not two separate entities as in other passages.

# Hebrews 5

***
















###### 1 







For every high priest chosen from among men is appointed [to act] on behalf of men in things relating to God, so that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins. 















###### 2 







He is able to deal gently with the _spiritually_ ignorant and misguided, since he is also subject to _human_ weakness; 















###### 3 







and because of this [human weakness] he is required to offer _sacrifices_ for sins, for himself as well as for the people. 















###### 4 







And besides, one does not appropriate for himself the honor [of being high priest], but he who is called by God, just as Aaron was. 















###### 5 







So too Christ did not glorify Himself so as to be made a high priest, but He [was exalted and appointed by the One] who said to Him, "You are My Son, Today I have begotten (fathered) You [declared Your authority and rule over the nations]"; 















###### 6 







just as He also says in another place, "You are a priest [appointed] forever According to the order of [^a]Melchizedek." 















###### 7 







In the days of His earthly life, Jesus offered up both [specific] petitions and [urgent] supplications [for that which He needed] with fervent crying and tears to the One who was [always] able to save Him from death, and He was heard because of His reverent submission toward God [His sinlessness and His unfailing determination to do the Father's will]. 















###### 8 







Although He was a Son [who had never been disobedient to the Father], He learned [active, special] obedience through what He suffered. 















###### 9 







And having been made perfect [uniquely equipped and prepared as Savior and retaining His integrity amid opposition], He became the source of eternal salvation [an eternal inheritance] to all those who obey Him, 















###### 10 







being designated by God as High Priest according to the order of [^b]Melchizedek. 















###### 11 







Concerning this we have much to say, and it is hard to explain, since you have become dull _and_ sluggish in [your spiritual] hearing _and_ disinclined to listen. 















###### 12 







For though by this time you ought to be teachers [because of the time you have had to learn these truths], you actually need someone to teach you again the elementary principles of God's word [from the beginning], and you have come to be _continually_ in need of milk, not solid food. 















###### 13 







For everyone who lives on milk is [doctrinally inexperienced and] unskilled in the word of righteousness, since he is a _spiritual_ infant. 















###### 14 







But solid food is for the [spiritually] mature, whose senses are trained by practice to distinguish between what is morally good and _what is_ evil. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Hebrews 8

***
















###### 1 







Now the main point of what we have to say _is this_: we have such a High Priest, [the Christ] who is seated [in the place of honor] at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty (God) in heaven, 















###### 2 







a Minister (Officiating Priest) in the holy places and in the true tabernacle, which is erected not by man, but by the Lord. 















###### 3 







For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices; so it is essential for this One also to have something to offer. 















###### 4 







Now if He were [still living] on earth, He would not be a priest at all, for there are priests who offer the gifts [to God] in accordance with the Law. 















###### 5 







They serve as a pattern and foreshadowing of [what has its true existence and reality in] the heavenly things (sanctuary). For when Moses was about to erect the tabernacle, he was warned _by God_, saying, "See that you make it all [exactly] according to the pattern which was shown to you on the mountain." 















###### 6 







But as it is, Christ has acquired a [priestly] ministry which is more excellent [than the old Levitical priestly ministry], for He is the Mediator (Arbiter) of a better covenant [uniting God and man], which has been enacted _and_ rests on better promises. ## A New Covenant 















###### 7 







For if that first _covenant_ had been faultless, there would have been no occasion for a second one _or_ an attempt to institute another one [the new covenant]. 















###### 8 







However, God finds fault with them [showing its inadequacy] when He says, "Behold, the days will come, says the Lord, When I will make _and_ ratify a new covenant With the house of Israel and with the house of Judah; 















###### 9 







Not like the covenant that I made with their fathers On the day when I took them by the hand To lead them out of the land of Egypt; For they did not abide in My covenant, And so I withdrew My favor _and_ disregarded them, says the Lord. 















###### 10 







"For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel After those days, says the Lord: I will imprint My laws upon their minds [even upon their innermost thoughts and understanding], And engrave them upon their hearts [effecting their regeneration]. And I will be their God, And they shall be My people. 















###### 11 







"And it will not be [necessary] for each one to teach his fellow citizen, Or each one his brother, saying, 'Know [by experience, have knowledge of] the Lord,' For all will know [Me by experience and have knowledge of] Me, From the least to the greatest of them. 















###### 12 







"For I will be merciful _and_ gracious toward their wickedness, And I will remember their sins no more." 















###### 13 







When God speaks of "A new _covenant_," He makes the first one obsolete. And whatever is becoming obsolete (out of use, annulled) and growing old is ready to disappear. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Hebrews 9

***
















###### 1 







Now even the first _covenant_ had regulations for divine worship and for the earthly sanctuary. 















###### 2 







A tabernacle (sacred tent) was put up, the outer one _or_ first section, in which were the lampstand and the table with [its loaves of] the sacred showbread; this is called the Holy Place. 















###### 3 







Behind the second veil there was another tabernacle [the inner one or second section] known as the Holy of Holies, 















###### 4 







[^a]having the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered entirely with gold. This contained a golden jar which held the manna, and the rod of Aaron that sprouted, and the [two stone] tablets of the covenant [inscribed with the Ten Commandments]; 















###### 5 







and above the ark were the [golden] cherubim of glory overshadowing [^b]the mercy seat; but we cannot now go into detail about these things. 















###### 6 







Now when these things have been prepared in this way, the priests continually enter the outer [or first section of the] tabernacle [that is, the Holy Place] performing [their ritual acts of] the divine worship, 















###### 7 







but into the second [inner tabernacle, the Holy of Holies], only the high priest _enters_ [and then only] once a year, and never without [bringing a sacrifice of] blood, which he offers [as a substitutionary atonement] for himself and for the sins of the people committed in ignorance. 















###### 8 







By this the Holy Spirit signifies that the way into the Holy Place [the true Holy of Holies and the presence of God] has not yet been disclosed as long as the [^c]first _or_ outer tabernacle is still standing [that is, as long as the Levitical system of worship remains a recognized institution], 















###### 9 







for this [first or outer tabernacle] is a symbol [that is, an archetype or paradigm] for the present time. Accordingly both gifts and sacrifices are offered which are incapable of perfecting the conscience _and_ renewing the [inner self of the] worshiper. 















###### 10 







For they [the gifts, sacrifices, and ceremonies] deal only with [clean and unclean] food and drink and various ritual washings, [mere] external regulations for the body imposed [to help the worshipers] until the time of reformation [that is, the time of the new order when Christ will establish the reality of what these things foreshadow--a better covenant]. 















###### 11 







But when Christ appeared as a High Priest of the good things to come [that is, true spiritual worship], _He entered_ through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not a part of this [material] creation. 















###### 12 







He went once for all into the Holy Place [the Holy of Holies of heaven, into the presence of God], and not through the blood of goats and calves, but through His own blood, having obtained _and_ secured eternal redemption [that is, the salvation of all who personally believe in Him as Savior]. 















###### 13 







For if the sprinkling of [ceremonially] defiled persons with the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a [burnt] heifer is sufficient for the cleansing of the body, 















###### 14 







how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal [Holy] Spirit _willingly_ offered Himself unblemished [that is, without moral or spiritual imperfection as a sacrifice] to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works _and_ lifeless observances to serve the ever living God? 















###### 15 







For this reason He is the Mediator _and_ Negotiator of a new covenant [that is, an entirely new agreement uniting God and man], so that those who have been called [by God] may receive [the fulfillment of] the promised eternal inheritance, since a death has taken place [as the payment] which redeems them from the sins _committed_ under the _obsolete_ first covenant. 















###### 16 







For where there is a will _and_ [^d]testament involved, the death of the one who made it must be established, 















###### 17 







for a will _and_ testament takes effect [only] at death, since it is never in force as long as the one who made it is alive. 















###### 18 







So even the first _covenant_ was not put in force without [the shedding of] blood. 















###### 19 







For when every commandment in the Law had been read by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of the calves and goats [which had been sacrificed], together with water and scarlet wool and with a bunch of hyssop, and he sprinkled both the scroll itself and all the people, 















###### 20 







saying, "This is the blood of the covenant [that seals and ratifies the agreement] which God ordained _and_ commanded [me to deliver to] you." 















###### 21 







And in the same way he sprinkled both the tabernacle and all the containers _and_ sacred utensils of worship with the blood. 















###### 22 







In fact under the Law almost everything is cleansed with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness [neither release from sin and its guilt, nor cancellation of the merited punishment]. 















###### 23 







Therefore it was necessary for the [earthly] copies of the heavenly things to be cleansed with these, but the heavenly things themselves required far better sacrifices than these. 















###### 24 







For Christ did not enter into a holy place made with hands, a mere copy of the true one, but [He entered] into heaven itself, now to appear in the very presence of God on our behalf; 















###### 25 







nor did He [enter into the heavenly sanctuary to] offer Himself again and again, as the high priest enters the Holy Place every year with blood that is not his own. 















###### 26 







Otherwise, He would have needed to suffer over and over since the foundation of the world; but now once for all at the consummation of the ages He has appeared _and_ been publicly manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself. 















###### 27 







And just as it is appointed _and_ destined for all men to die once and after this [comes certain] judgment, 















###### 28 







so Christ, having been offered once _and_ once for all to bear [as a burden] [^e]the sins of many, will appear a second time [when he returns to earth], not to deal with sin, but to bring salvation to those who are eagerly _and_ confidently waiting for Him. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: Hebrews 9:5 I.e. the lid of the ark where blood was sprinkled by the high priest. [^c]: Hebrews 9:8 During the age of the old covenant a worshiper had no direct access to God. [^d]: Hebrews 9:16 This Greek word may also be translated “covenant” as in v 18 and the author may be engaging in deliberate word play here playing off of both meanings. [^e]: Hebrews 9:28 See Is 53:10-12.

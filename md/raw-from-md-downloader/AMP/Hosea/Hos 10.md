# Hosea 10

***
















###### 1 







Israel is a luxuriant _and_ prolific vine; He produces fruit for himself. The more his fruit, The more altars he made [to Baal]; The richer his land, The better he made the [idolatrous] pillars. 















###### 2 







Their heart is divided (faithless); Now they must bear their guilt _and_ punishment. The LORD will break down [the horns of] their altars; He will destroy their _idolatrous_ pillars. 















###### 3 







Surely now they will say [in despair], "We have no [true] king, For we do not revere the LORD; And as for the king, what can he do for us [to rescue us]?" 















###### 4 







They have spoken _empty (disingenuous)_ words, Swearing falsely to make covenants [they intend to break]; Therefore, judgment springs up like poisonous weeds in the furrows of the field. 















###### 5 







The people of Samaria will fear _and_ tremble For the [idolatrous] calf of [^a]Beth-aven (House of Wickedness). Indeed, its people will mourn over it And its idolatrous priests will cry out _and_ wail over it, Over its glory, because the glory [of their calf god] has departed from it. 















###### 6 







The golden calf itself will be carried to Assyria As tribute to King Jareb; Ephraim will be seized with shame And Israel will be ashamed of his own counsel [to worship the calf and separate Israel from Judah]. 















###### 7 







As for Samaria, her king will be cut off _and_ float away Like a twig on the surface of the water. 















###### 8 







Also the high places of Aven (Beth-aven), the sin of Israel, will be destroyed; The thorn and the thistle will grow on their [pagan] altars, And [in despair] they will say to the mountains, "Cover us!" And to the hills, "Fall on us!" 















###### 9 







O Israel, you have [willfully] sinned since the days of Gibeah; There they (Israel) stand! Will not the battle against the sons of wickedness overtake them at Gibeah? 















###### 10 







When it is my desire [to defend My righteousness], I will chastise them; And [hostile] peoples will be gathered against them When they are bound _and_ punished for their double guilt [their revolt against the LORD and their worship of idols]. 















###### 11 







Ephraim is a trained heifer that loves to tread out the grain, But I will come over her fair neck _with a heavy yoke_ [for hard field work]. I will harness Ephraim; Judah will plow and Jacob will harrow _and_ rake for himself. 















###### 12 







Sow with a view to righteousness [that righteousness, like seed, may germinate]; Reap in accordance with mercy _and_ lovingkindness. Break up your uncultivated ground, For it is time to seek _and_ search diligently for the LORD [and to long for His blessing] Until He comes to rain righteousness _and_ His gift of salvation on you. 















###### 13 







You have plowed _and_ planted wickedness, you have reaped the [willful] injustice [of oppressors], You have eaten the fruit of lies. Because you have trusted in your own way _and_ your chariots, and in your many warriors, 















###### 14 







Therefore an uproar will arise among your people, And all your fortresses will be destroyed, As Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel on the day of battle, When mothers were dashed in pieces with their children. 















###### 15 







In this way it will be done to you at [idolatrous] Bethel because of your great wickedness; At daybreak the king of Israel will be completely cut off. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Hosea 11

***
















###### 1 







When Israel was a child [a young nation], I loved him, And I called My son out of Egypt. 















###### 2 







The more they [the prophets] called them [to repentance and obedience], The more they went away from them; They kept sacrificing to the Baals And burning incense to the carved images. 















###### 3 







Yet it is I who taught Ephraim to walk, Taking them in My arms [nurturing the young nation]; But they did not know that I healed them. 















###### 4 







I led them _gently_ with cords of a man, with bonds of love [guiding them], And I was to them as one who lifts up _and_ eases the yoke [of the law] over their jaws; And I bent down to them and fed them. 















###### 5 







They will not return to the land of Egypt, But Assyria will be their king [bringing them into captivity] Because they refused to return _to Me_. 















###### 6 







The sword will whirl against _and_ fall on their cities, And will demolish the bars of their gates _and_ fortifications And will consume them because of their counsels. 















###### 7 







My people are bent on turning from Me; Though the prophets call them to _the One_ on high, None at all exalts _Him_. 















###### 8 







How can I give you up, O Ephraim? How can I surrender you, O Israel? How can I make you like Admah? How can I treat you like [^a]Zeboiim? My heart recoils within Me; All My compassions are kindled together [for My nation of Israel]. 















###### 9 







I will not execute the fierceness of My anger; I will not return to Ephraim to destroy him again. For I am God and not man, the Holy One in your midst [who will not revoke My covenant], And I will not come in wrath _or_ enter the city [in judgment]. 















###### 10 







They will walk after the LORD [in obedience and worship], Who will roar like a lion; He will roar [summoning them] And _His_ sons will come trembling from the west. 















###### 11 







They will come trembling _and_ hurriedly like birds from Egypt And like doves from the land of Assyria; And I will settle them in their houses [in the land of their inheritance], declares the LORD. 















###### 12 







Ephraim surrounds Me with lies And the house of Israel with deceit; Judah is also unruly against God, Even against the faithful Holy One. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

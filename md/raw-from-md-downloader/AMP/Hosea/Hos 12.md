# Hosea 12

***
















###### 1 







Ephraim feeds on the [emptiness of the] wind And [continually] pursues the [parching] east wind [which brings destruction]; Every day he multiplies lies and violence. Further, he makes a covenant with Assyria And (olive) oil is carried to Egypt [to seek alliances]. 















###### 2 







The LORD also has a dispute [a legal complaint and an indictment] with Judah, And He will punish Jacob in accordance with his ways; He will repay him in accordance with his deeds. 















###### 3 







In _their mother's_ womb he took his brother by the heel, And in his maturity he contended with God. 















###### 4 







He wrestled with the angel and prevailed; He wept [in repentance] and sought His favor. He met Him at Bethel And there God spoke with [him and through him with] us-- 















###### 5 







Even the LORD, the God of hosts, The name of Him [who spoke with Jacob] is the LORD. 















###### 6 







Therefore, return [in repentance] to your God, Observe _and_ highly regard kindness and justice, And wait [expectantly] for your God continually. 















###### 7 







A merchant, in whose hand are false _and_ fraudulent balances; He loves to oppress _and_ exploit. 















###### 8 







Ephraim said, "I have indeed become rich [and powerful as a nation]; I have found wealth for myself. In all my labors they will not find in me Any wickedness that _would be_ sin." 















###### 9 







But I _have been_ the LORD your God since [you became a nation in] the land of Egypt; I will make you live in tents again, As in the days of the appointed _and_ solemn [^a]festival. 















###### 10 







I have also spoken to [you through] the prophets, And I gave [them] many visions [to make My will known], And through the prophets I gave parables [to appeal to your sense of right and wrong]. 















###### 11 







Is there wickedness (idolatry) in Gilead? Surely the people there are worthless. In Gilgal [they defy Me when] they sacrifice bulls, Yes, [after My judgment] their [pagan] altars are like the stone heaps In the furrows of the fields. 















###### 12 







Now Jacob (Israel) fled into the open country of Aram (Paddan-aram), And [there] Israel (Jacob) worked _and_ served for a wife, And for a wife he kept _sheep_. 















###### 13 







And by a prophet (Moses) the LORD brought Israel up from Egypt, And by a prophet Israel was preserved. 















###### 14 







Ephraim has provoked most bitter anger; So his Lord will leave his bloodguilt on him [invoking punishment] And bring back to him his shame _and_ dishonor. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Hosea 13

***
















###### 1 







When Ephraim spoke, _there was_ trembling _and_ terror. He exalted himself [above the other tribes] in Israel; But through [the worship of] Baal he became guilty and died [spiritually, and then came ruin, sealing Israel's doom as a nation]. 















###### 2 







And now they sin more and more, And make for themselves molten images, Idols skillfully made from their silver [as it pleased them], All of them the work of the craftsmen. They say of these [very works of their hands], "Let those who sacrifice kiss _and_ show respect to the calves [as if they were living gods]!" 















###### 3 







Therefore they will be [swiftly dissipated] like the morning cloud Or like dew which soon disappears, Like chaff which swirls with the whirlwind from the threshing floor, And like smoke from the chimney _or_ through the window [worthless and without substance --they will vanish]. 















###### 4 







Yet I _have been_ the LORD your God Since [the time you became a nation in] the land of Egypt; And you were not to know any god except Me, For there is no savior besides Me. 















###### 5 







I knew _and_ regarded you _and_ cared for you in the wilderness, In the land of drought. 















###### 6 







When _they had_ their pasture, they became satisfied, And being satisfied, their heart became proud (self-centered); Therefore they forgot Me. 















###### 7 







So I will be like a lion to them; Like a leopard I will watch _and_ lie in wait [ready to attack] by the road [to Assyria]. 















###### 8 







I will encounter them like a bear robbed of her cubs, And I will tear open their chests; There I will also devour them like a lioness, As a wild beast would tear them. 















###### 9 







It is your destruction, O Israel, Because _you are_ against Me, [and have rebelled] against your help. 















###### 10 







Where now is your king That he may save you [when you are attacked] in all your cities? And your judges of whom you asked, "Give me a king and princes"? 















###### 11 







I gave you a king in My anger, And I took him away in My wrath [as punishment]. 















###### 12 







The wickedness of Ephraim [which is not yet completely punished] is bound up [as in a bag]; His sin is stored up [for judgment and destruction]. 















###### 13 







The pains of childbirth come on him; But he is not a wise son, For it is not the time to delay [his chance at a new birth] as the womb opens [but he ignores the opportunity to change]. 















###### 14 







Shall I ransom them from the power of Sheol (the place of the dead)? Shall I redeem them from death? [^a]O death, where are your thorns? O Sheol, where is your sting? Compassion is hidden from My eyes [because of their failure to repent]. 















###### 15 







For though he flourishes among the reeds (his fellow tribes), An east wind (Assyria) will come, The breath of the LORD rising from the desert; And Ephraim's spring will become dry And his fountain will be dried up. Assyria will plunder his treasury of every precious object. 















###### 16 







Samaria will be found guilty [and become desolate], Because she rebelled against her God; They will fall by the sword, Their infants will be dashed in pieces, And their pregnant women will be ripped open. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

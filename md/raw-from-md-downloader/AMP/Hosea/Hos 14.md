# Hosea 14

***
















###### 1 







O Israel, return [in repentance] to the LORD your God, For you have stumbled _and_ fallen [visited by tragedy], because of your sin. 















###### 2 







Take the words [confessing your guilt] with you and return to the LORD. Say to Him, "Take away all our wickedness; Accept what is good _and_ receive us graciously, So that we may present the fruit of our lips (gratitude). 















###### 3 







"Assyria will not save us; We will not ride on horses [relying on military might], Nor will we say again to [the idols who are] the work of our hands, 'You are our gods.' For in You [O LORD] the orphan finds love _and_ compassion _and_ mercy." 















###### 4 







I will heal their apostasy _and_ faithlessness; I will love them freely, For My anger has turned away from Israel. 















###### 5 







I shall be like the dew to Israel; He will blossom like the lily, And he will take root like _the cedars of_ Lebanon. 















###### 6 







His shoots will sprout, And his beauty will be like the olive tree And his fragrance like _the cedars of_ Lebanon. 















###### 7 







Those who live in his shadow Will again raise grain, And they will blossom like the vine. His renown _will be_ like the wine of Lebanon. 















###### 8 







O Ephraim, what more have I to do with idols? It is I who have answered and will care for you _and_ watch over you. I am like a luxuriant cypress tree; With Me your fruit is found [which is to nourish you]. 















###### 9 







Whoever is [spiritually] wise, let him understand these things; _Whoever_ is [spiritually] discerning _and_ understanding, let him know them. For the ways of the LORD are right, And the righteous will walk in them, But transgressors will stumble _and_ fall in them. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

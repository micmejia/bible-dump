# Hosea 3

***
















###### 1 







Then the LORD said to me, "Go again, love a woman ([^a]Gomer) who is beloved by her husband and yet is an adulteress, even as the LORD loves the [^b]children of Israel, though they turn to other gods and love the raisin cakes [used in the feasts in pagan worship]." 















###### 2 







So I bought her for myself for [^c]fifteen pieces of silver and a homer and a half of barley [the price of a common slave]. 















###### 3 







And I said to her, "You shall stay with me for many days. You shall not play the prostitute nor shall you have a man; so I will also be toward you [until you have proved your faithfulness]." 















###### 4 







For the sons of Israel will remain for many days without king or prince, without sacrifice or [idolatrous] pillar, and without [^d]ephod or teraphim (household idols). 















###### 5 







Afterward the sons of Israel will return [in deep repentance] and seek the LORD their God and [seek from the line of] David their king [the King of kings--the Messiah]; and they will come trembling to the LORD and to His goodness _and_ blessing in the last days. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

Also, the application of the symbolism to God’s relationship with Israel seems to depend upon the woman’s being Gomer. The purpose of the ambiguities probably is to reflect the emotional estrangement between Hosea and Gomer and the contempt that she deserved for her behavior. Matthew’s anonymous reference to Bathsheba literally as “wife of Uriah” (Matt 1:6). [^b]: Hosea 3:1 See note 1:10. [^c]: Hosea 3:2 Hosea bought Gomer back after she had become a slave. The silver and barley together totaled about thirty pieces of silver. See Ex 21:7, 32; 2 Kin 7:1, 16, 18. [^d]: Hosea 3:4 A garment worn by priests when seeking divine counsel.

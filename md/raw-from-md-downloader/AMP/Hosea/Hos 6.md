# Hosea 6

***
















###### 1 







"Come and let us return [in repentance] to the LORD, For He has torn us, but He will heal us; He has wounded us, but He will bandage us. 















###### 2 







"After two days He will revive us; On the third day He will raise us up That we may live before Him. 















###### 3 







"So let us know _and_ become personally acquainted with Him; let us press on to know _and_ understand fully the [greatness of the] LORD [to honor, heed, and deeply cherish Him]. His appearing is prepared _and_ is as certain as the dawn, And He will come to us [in salvation] like the [heavy] rain, Like the spring rain watering the earth." ## The Reply of the Lord 















###### 4 







O Ephraim, what shall I do with you? O Judah, what shall I do with you? For your [wavering] loyalty _and_ kindness are [transient] like the morning cloud And like the dew that goes away early. 















###### 5 







Therefore, I have hewn them in pieces by [the words of] the prophets; I have slain them by the words of My mouth; My judgments [pronounced upon them by the prophets] are like the light that shines forth [obvious to all]. 















###### 6 







For I desire _and_ delight in [steadfast] loyalty [faithfulness in the covenant relationship], rather than sacrifice, And in the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings. 















###### 7 







But they, like Adam, have transgressed the covenant; There they have dealt treacherously against Me. 















###### 8 







Gilead is a city of wrongdoers; It is tracked with bloody _footprints_. 















###### 9 







And as bands of robbers [lie in] wait for a man, So a band of priests murder on the road toward [^a]Shechem [covering their crimes in that city of refuge]; Certainly they have committed crimes _and_ outrages. 















###### 10 







I have seen a horrible thing [sins of every kind] in the house of Israel! Ephraim's prostitution (idolatry) is there; Israel has defiled itself. 















###### 11 







Also, O Judah, there is a harvest [of divine judgment] appointed for you, When I restore the fortunes of My people [who have been slaves to the misery of sin]. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

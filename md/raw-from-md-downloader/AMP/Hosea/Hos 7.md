# Hosea 7

***
















###### 1 







When I would heal Israel, The sin (guilt) of Ephraim is uncovered, And the wickedness of [^a]Samaria, Because they practice false dealing; The thief enters, Bandits ravage _and_ raid outside. 















###### 2 







But they do not consider in their hearts (minds) That I remember [always] all their wickedness. Now their deeds surround _and_ entangle them; They are before My face. 















###### 3 







They make the king glad with their wickedness, And the princes with their lies. 















###### 4 







They are all adulterers; Like the heat of an oven When the baker ceases to stir _the fire_, [their passion smolders] From the kneading of the dough until it is leavened. 















###### 5 







On the [special] day of our king, the princes became sick with the heat of wine; The king stretched out his hand [in association] with scoffers (lawless people). 















###### 6 







As they approach their plotting, Their mind burns [with intrigue] like an oven [while they lie in wait]. Their anger smolders all night; In the morning it blazes like a flaming fire. 















###### 7 







They are all hot like an oven And they consume their judges (rulers); All their kings have fallen. There is no one among them who calls to Me. 















###### 8 







Ephraim mixes himself with the [Gentile] nations [seeking favor with one country, then another]; Ephraim is a cake not turned [worthless; ready to be thrown away]. 















###### 9 







Strangers have devoured his strength, Yet he does not know it; Gray hairs are sprinkled on him, Yet he does not know. 















###### 10 







Though the pride of Israel testifies against him, Yet they do not return [in repentance] to the LORD their God, Nor seek _nor_ search for _nor_ desire Him [as essential] in spite of all this. 















###### 11 







Ephraim also is like a silly dove, without heart _or_ good sense; They call to Egypt [for help], they go to Assyria. 















###### 12 







When they go, I will spread My net over them; I will bring them down like birds of the heavens [into Assyrian captivity]. I will chastise them in accordance with the proclamation (prophecy) to their congregation. 















###### 13 







Woe (judgment is coming) to them, for they have wandered away from Me! Devastation is theirs, because they have rebelled _and_ trespassed against Me! I would redeem them, but they speak lies against Me. 















###### 14 







They do not cry out to Me from their heart When they wail on their beds [in unbelieving despair]; For the sake of grain and new wine they [^b]assemble themselves [as if worshiping Baal]; They rebel against Me. 















###### 15 







Although I trained and strengthened their arms [for victory over their enemies], Yet they devise evil against Me. 















###### 16 







They turn, but they do not turn upward to the Most High. They are like a poorly crafted bow [that misses the mark]; Their princes shall fall by the sword Because of the insolence of their tongue. This _will be_ cause for their mockery _and_ disdain in the land of Egypt. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

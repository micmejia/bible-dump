# Hosea 8

***
















###### 1 







Set the trumpet to your lips [announcing impending judgment]! Like a [great] vulture _the enemy comes_ against the house of the LORD, Because they have broken My covenant And transgressed _and_ rebelled against My law. 















###### 2 







Then they will cry out to Me, "My God, we of Israel know You!" 















###### 3 







Israel has rejected the good; The enemy shall pursue him. 















###### 4 







They set up kings, but not from Me [therefore without My blessing]; They have appointed princes, but I did not know it. With their silver and their gold they made idols for themselves, That they might be cut off. 















###### 5 







He has rejected your [pagan] calf, O Samaria, _saying_, "My wrath burns against them." How long will they be incapable of innocence? 















###### 6 







For even this [loathsome calf] is from Israel. A craftsman made it, so it is not God; Surely the calf of Samaria will be broken to pieces _and_ go up in flames. 















###### 7 







For they sow the wind [in evil] And they reap the whirlwind [in disaster]. The standing grain has no growth; It yields no grain. If it were to yield, strangers would swallow it up. 















###### 8 







Israel is [as if] swallowed up [by enemies]; They are now among the nations Like a vessel [of cheap, coarse pottery] that is useless. 















###### 9 







For they have gone up to Assyria, Like a wild donkey wandering alone _and_ taking her own way; Ephraim has hired lovers (pagan allies). 















###### 10 







Yes, even though [with presents] they hire _allies_ among the nations, Now I will gather them up; And [in a little while] they will begin [^a]to grow weak _and_ diminish Because of the burden imposed by the king of princes [the king of Assyria]. 















###### 11 







For Ephraim has constructed many altars for sin; They are altars intended for sinning [which multiply his guilt]. 















###### 12 







I wrote for him the ten thousand _precepts_ of My law, But they are regarded as a strange thing [which does not concern him]. 















###### 13 







As for My sacrificial offerings, They sacrifice the meat [as a mere formality] and eat it, But the LORD is not pleased with them _and_ does not accept them. Now He will remember _and_ take into account their wickedness _and_ guilt, And punish them for their sins. They will return [in captivity] to [another] Egypt [that is, Assyria]. 















###### 14 







For Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces [and pagan temples], And Judah has built many fortified cities; But I will send a fire upon their cities so that it may consume their palaces _and_ fortresses. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

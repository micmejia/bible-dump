# Hosea 9

***
















###### 1 







Do not rejoice, O Israel, with exultation as do the [pagan] peoples, For you have played the prostitute, _turning_ away from your God. You have loved _prostitutes_' earnings on every threshing floor [attributing the harvest to the Baals instead of to God]. 















###### 2 







The threshing floor and the wine press will no longer feed them, And the new wine will fail them [because they failed to honor the God who provides]. 















###### 3 







They will not remain in the land of the LORD, But Ephraim will return to [another] Egypt [in bondage] And they will eat [ceremonially] unclean _food_ in Assyria. 















###### 4 







They will not pour out drink offerings of wine to the LORD; Their sacrifices will not please Him. _Their bread will be_ like mourners' bread [eaten at funerals]; All who eat it will be [ceremonially] unclean, For their bread will be for themselves; It will not enter the house of the LORD [to be consecrated]. 















###### 5 







What will you do on the day of the appointed festival And on the day of the feast of the LORD [when you are in exile]? 















###### 6 







For behold, they will go away because of devastation _and_ destruction; Egypt will gather them up, Memphis will bury them. Weeds will take over their treasures of silver; Thorns _will grow_ in their tents. 















###### 7 







The days of punishment have come; The days of retribution are at hand; Let Israel know this! The prophet is [considered] a fool; The man [of God] who is inspired is [treated as if] demented, Because of the abundance of your wickedness _and_ guilt, And _because_ your deep antagonism [toward God and the prophets] is so great. 















###### 8 







Ephraim was a watchman with my God, a [true] prophet [to warn the nation]; But the snare of a bird catcher was laid in all his paths. And there is _only_ deep hostility in the house of his God (the land of Israel). 















###### 9 







They have deeply corrupted (perverted) themselves As in the days of Gibeah. The LORD will remember their wickedness _and_ guilt; He will punish their sins. 















###### 10 







I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness [an unexpected and refreshing delight]; I saw your fathers (ancestors) as the first ripe fruit on the fig tree in its first _season_, But they came to Baal-peor and consecrated themselves to shamefulness [the worship of Baal], And [because of their spiritual and physical adultery] they became as detestable _and_ loathsome as the thing they loved. 















###### 11 







As for Ephraim, their glory will fly away like a bird; No birth, no pregnancy, and [because of their impurity] no conception. 















###### 12 







Even though they bring up their children, Yet I will bereave them until not one is left. Indeed, woe (judgment is coming) to them when I look away _and_ withdraw [My blessing] from them! 















###### 13 







Ephraim, as I have seen, Is planted in a pleasant [and prosperous] meadow like Tyre; But Ephraim will bring out his children to the executioner [for slaughter]. 















###### 14 







Give them [the punishment they deserve], O LORD! What will You give? Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts. 















###### 15 







All their wickedness [says the LORD] is focused in Gilgal; Indeed, I came to hate them there! Because of the wickedness of their [idolatrous] practices I will drive them out of My house (the land of Israel)! I will love them no longer; All their princes are rebels. 















###### 16 







Ephraim is stricken, their root is dried up, They will bear no fruit. Even though they give birth, I will slay the precious children of their womb. 















###### 17 







My God will reject them _and_ cast them away Because they did not listen to Him; And they will be wanderers (fugitives) among the nations. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Isaiah 15

***
















###### 1 







The [mournful, inspired] oracle ([^a]a burden to be carried) concerning Moab: Because in a night Ar of Moab is devastated and ruined; Because in a night Kir of Moab is devastated and ruined. 















###### 2 







They have gone up to the temple and to Dibon, to the high places to weep. Moab wails over Nebo and over Medeba; Everyone's head is shaved, and every beard is cut off [in mourning]. 















###### 3 







In their streets they have wrapped themselves with sackcloth; On their [flat] housetops and in their open squares Everyone is wailing, dissolved in tears. 















###### 4 







Heshbon and Elealeh [cities claimed by Moab] cry out; Their voice is heard as far as Jahaz. Therefore the armed men of Moab cry out; Moab's soul trembles within him. 















###### 5 







My heart cries out for Moab; His fugitives are [fleeing] as far as Zoar and Eglath-shelishiyah. For they go up the ascent of Luhith weeping; For on the road to Horonaim they raise a cry of distress over their destruction. 















###### 6 







For the waters of Nimrim are desolate. Indeed the grass is withered, the new growth dies; There is no green thing. 















###### 7 







Therefore the abundance _which_ they have acquired and stored away They carry off over the Brook of the Willows. 















###### 8 







For the cry of distress has echoed around the territory of Moab; The wailing _goes_ as far as Eglaim and the mournful cry to Beer-elim. 















###### 9 







For the waters of Dimon are full of blood; Yet I will bring even more _woes_ on Dimon-- A lion upon those of Moab who escape and upon the remnant of the land. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

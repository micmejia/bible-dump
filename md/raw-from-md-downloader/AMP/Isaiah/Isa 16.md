# Isaiah 16

***
















###### 1 







Send lambs to the ruler of the land [[^a]you Moabites], From Sela [that is, Petra in Edom] through the wilderness to the mountain of the Daughter of Zion (Jerusalem). 















###### 2 







For like wandering birds or scattered nestlings, The daughters of Moab will be at the fords of the [river] Arnon. 















###### 3 







[Say to the ruler] "Give us advice, make a decision [for Moab, king of Judah]; Cast your shadow [over us] like night in the midst of noon; Hide the outcasts, do not betray the fugitive [to his pursuer]. 















###### 4 







"Let our outcasts of Moab live among you; Be a [sheltered] hiding place to them from the destroyer." For the extortioner has come to an end, destruction has ceased, Oppressors [who trample men] have completely _disappeared_ from the land, 















###### 5 







A throne will be established in lovingkindness, And One will sit on it in faithfulness in the tent (dynasty, family) of David; Judging _and_ seeking justice And being prompt to do righteousness. 















###### 6 







We have heard of the pride of Moab, an excessive pride-- Even of his arrogance, his conceit, his rage, His untruthful boasting. 















###### 7 







Therefore Moab will wail for Moab; everyone will wail. You will mourn for the raisin cakes of Kir-hareseth, As those who are utterly stricken _and_ discouraged. 















###### 8 







For the fields of Heshbon have languished _and_ withered, and the vines of Sibmah _as well_; The lords of the nations have trampled down [Moab's] choice vine branches, Which reached as far as Jazer and wandered into the wilderness; Its tendrils stretched out, they passed over [the shores of] the [Dead] Sea. 















###### 9 







Therefore I (Isaiah) will weep bitterly for Jazer, for the vines of Sibmah. I will drench you with my tears, O Heshbon and Elealeh; For the war-cry [of the enemy] has fallen on your summer fruits and your harvest. 















###### 10 







Gladness and joy are taken away from the fruitful field; In the vineyards there will be no singing or joyful sound; No treader treads out wine in the presses, For I (God) put an end to the joyful shouting. 















###### 11 







Therefore my heart sounds like a harp [in mournful compassion] for Moab, And my inner being _mourns_ for Kir-hareseth. 















###### 12 







So it will come to pass when Moab presents himself, When he wearies himself [worshiping] on his high place [of idolatry] And comes to his sanctuary [of Chemosh, god of Moab] to pray, That he will not prevail. 















###### 13 







This is the word which the LORD spoke earlier concerning Moab [when Moab's pride and resistance to God were first known]. 















###### 14 







But now the LORD speaks, saying, "Within [^b]three years, as the years of a hired man [who will not serve longer than the agreed time], the glory of Moab will be degraded along with all [^c]the great population, and the remnant [that survives] will be very small and of no account." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: Isaiah 16:14 This prophecy was fulfilled after the death of King Ahaz of Judah (Is 14:28), about the third year of King Hezekiah’s reign. Moab was not left completely without population at this time; there was still a “remnant.” The final desolation of Moab was reserved for King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon in 582 b.c., some five years after the taking of Jerusalem. The ruins of Elealeh, Heshbon, Medeba, Dimon, etc., still exist to confirm through modern research the accuracy of the fulfillment of this prophecy. [^c]: Isaiah 16:14 Lit _all the great number_.

# Isaiah 19

***
















###### 1 







The [mournful, inspired] oracle ([^a]a burden to be carried) concerning Egypt: Listen carefully, the LORD is riding on a swift cloud and is about to come to Egypt; The idols of Egypt will tremble at His presence, And the heart of the Egyptians will melt within them. 















###### 2 







"So I will provoke Egyptians against Egyptians; And they will fight, each one against his brother and each one against his neighbor, City against city, kingdom against kingdom. 















###### 3 







"Then the spirit of the Egyptians will become exhausted within them _and_ emptied out; And I will confuse their strategy, So that they will consult the idols and the spirits of the dead, And mediums and soothsayers. 















###### 4 







"And I will hand over the Egyptians to a hard _and_ cruel master, And a mighty king will rule over them," declares the Lord God of hosts. 















###### 5 







The waters from the sea will dry up, And the river will be parched and dry. 















###### 6 







The canals will become foul-smelling, The streams of Egypt will thin out and dry up, The reeds and the rushes will rot away. 















###### 7 







The meadows by the Nile, by the edge of the Nile, And all the sown fields of the Nile Will become dry, be blown away, and be no more. 















###### 8 







The fishermen will lament (cry out in grief), And all those who cast a hook into the Nile will mourn, And those who spread nets upon the waters will languish. 















###### 9 







Moreover, those who make linen from combed flax And those who weave white cloth will be ashamed. 















###### 10 







[Those who are] the pillars _and_ foundations _of Egypt_ will be crushed; And all those who work for wages will be grieved in soul. 















###### 11 







The princes of [^b]Zoan are complete fools; The counsel of the Pharaoh's wisest advisors has become stupid. How can you say to Pharaoh, "I am a son of the wise, a son of ancient kings?" 















###### 12 







Where then are your wise men? Please let them tell you, And let them understand what the LORD of hosts Has purposed against Egypt [if they can]. 















###### 13 







The princes of Zoan have acted like fools, The princes of Memphis are deluded [and entertain false hope]; _Those who are_ the cornerstone of her tribes Have led Egypt astray. 















###### 14 







The LORD has mixed a spirit of distortion within her; Her leaders have caused Egypt to stagger in all that she does, As a drunken man staggers in his vomit. 















###### 15 







There will be no work for Egypt Which head or tail, [high] palm branch or [low] bulrush, may do. 















###### 16 







In that day the Egyptians will become like [helpless] women, and they will tremble and be frightened because of the waving of the hand of the LORD of hosts, which He is going to wave over them. 















###### 17 







The land of Judah [Assyria's ally] will become a terror to the Egyptians; everyone to whom Judah is mentioned will be in dread of it, because of the purpose of the LORD of hosts which He is planning against Egypt. 















###### 18 







In that day five cities in the land of Egypt will speak the language of [the Hebrews of] Canaan and swear _allegiance_ to the LORD of hosts. One [of them] will be called the City of [^c]Destruction. 















###### 19 







In that day there will be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a memorial stone to the LORD near its border. 















###### 20 







It will become a sign and a witness to the LORD of hosts in the land of Egypt; for they will cry to the LORD because of oppressors, and He will send them a Savior, a [Great] Defender, and He will rescue them. 















###### 21 







And so the LORD will make Himself known to Egypt, and the Egyptians will know [heed, honor, and cherish] the LORD in that day. They will even worship with sacrifices [of animals] and offerings [of produce]; they will make a vow to the LORD and fulfill it. 















###### 22 







The LORD will strike Egypt, striking but healing it; so they will return to the LORD, and He will respond to them and heal them. 















###### 23 







In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrians will come into Egypt and the Egyptians into Assyria; and the Egyptians will worship _and_ serve [the LORD] with the Assyrians. 















###### 24 







In that day Israel will be the third _party_ with Egypt and with Assyria [in a Messianic league], a blessing in the midst of the earth, 















###### 25 







whom the LORD of hosts has blessed, saying, "Blessed is Egypt My people, and Assyria the work of My hands, and Israel My heritage." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

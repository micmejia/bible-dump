# Isaiah 2

***
















###### 1 







The word [from God] which Isaiah son of Amoz saw [in a vision] concerning [the nation of] Judah and [its capital city] Jerusalem. 















###### 2 







Now it will come to pass that In the last days The mountain of the house of the LORD Will be [firmly] established as the [^a]highest of the mountains, And will be exalted above the hills; And all the nations will stream to it. 















###### 3 







And many peoples shall come and say, "Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, To the house (temple) of the God of Jacob; That He may teach us His ways And that we may walk in His paths." For the law will go out from Zion And the word of the LORD from Jerusalem. 















###### 4 







And He will judge between the nations, And will mediate [disputes] for many peoples; And they will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not lift up the sword against nation, And never again will they learn war. 















###### 5 







O house of Jacob, come, let us walk in the light of the LORD. 















###### 6 







Most certainly [LORD] You have abandoned your people, the house of Jacob, Because they are filled _with influences_ from the east, And they are soothsayers [who foretell] like the Philistines; Also they strike _bargains_ with the children of foreigners (pagans). 















###### 7 







Their land has also been filled with silver and gold And there is no end to their treasures; Their land has also been filled with horses And there is no end to their chariots. 















###### 8 







Their land has also been filled with idols; They worship the work of their hands, That which their own fingers have made. 















###### 9 







So the _common_ man has been humbled [before idols] And the man _of importance_ has been degraded, Therefore do not forgive them [O LORD]. 















###### 10 







Go among the rocks and hide in the dust From the terror of the LORD and from the splendor of His majesty. 















###### 11 







The proud look of man will be degraded And the arrogance of men will be humbled, And the LORD alone will be exalted in that day. ## A Day of Reckoning Coming 















###### 12 







For the LORD of hosts will have a day _of reckoning_ Against all who are proud and arrogant And against all who are lifted up, That they may be degraded. 















###### 13 







And the wrath of God will be against all the cedars of Lebanon [west of the Jordan] that are high and lifted up, Against all the oaks of Bashan [east of the Jordan], 















###### 14 







Against all the high mountains, Against all the hills that are lifted up, 















###### 15 







Against every high tower, Against every fortified wall, 















###### 16 







Against all the ships of Tarshish And against all the beautiful craft. 















###### 17 







Then the pride of man will be humbled And the arrogance of men will be degraded; The LORD alone shall be exalted in that day, 















###### 18 







And the idols will completely vanish (be abolished). 















###### 19 







They [the stricken, deprived of all in which they had trusted] will go into the caves of the rocks And into the holes of the ground [fleeing] From the terror _and_ dread of the LORD And from the splendor of His majesty, When He arises to terrify the earth. 















###### 20 







In that day men will throw away to the moles and to the bats Their idols of silver and their idols of gold, Which they made for themselves [as objects] to worship, 















###### 21 







To go into the caverns of the rocks and into the clefts of the [ragged] cliffs [as they flee] From the terror _and_ dread of the LORD and the splendor of His majesty, When He arises to terrify the earth. 















###### 22 







Stop regarding man, whose breath [of life] is in his nostrils [for so little time]; For why should he be esteemed? ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Isaiah 20

***
















###### 1 







In the year that the Tartan [the Assyrian commander in chief] came to Ashdod [in Philistia], when Sargon king of Assyria sent him and he fought against Ashdod and captured it, 















###### 2 







at that time the LORD spoke through Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, "Go, untie the [^a]sackcloth from your hips and take your sandals off your feet." And he did so, walking around [^b]stripped [to his loincloth] and barefoot. 















###### 3 







And the LORD said, "Even as My servant Isaiah has walked [^c]stripped and barefoot for three years as a sign and forewarning concerning Egypt and Cush (Ethiopia), 















###### 4 







in the same way the king of Assyria will lead away the Egyptian captives and the Cushite exiles, young and old, stripped and barefoot, even with buttocks uncovered--to the [^d]shame of Egypt. 















###### 5 







Then they will be dismayed and ashamed because of Cush their hope and Egypt their boast. 















###### 6 







So the inhabitants of this coastland [the Israelites and their neighbors] will say in that day, 'Look what has happened to those in whom we hoped _and_ trusted and to whom we fled for help to be spared from the king of Assyria! But we, how will we escape [captivity and exile]?'" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: Isaiah 20:2 Or _naked_. The Hebrew can refer to someone completely naked, or only stripped to the underwear (i.e. a loincloth); see note v 4. The ancient rabbis were particularly sensitive to the issue, and some maintained (contrary to the text) that Isaiah was wearing worn-out clothes and patched shoes or sandals. [^c]: Isaiah 20:3 Stripping off the outer garments was an act symbolizing disgrace and humiliation. [^d]: Isaiah 20:4 Lit _nakedness_. As noted for v 2, the Hebrew can refer to complete nakedness or to being stripped to the underwear. A loincloth might leave the buttocks exposed to a greater or lesser extent.

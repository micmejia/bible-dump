# Isaiah 21

***
















###### 1 







The [mournful, inspired] oracle ([^a]a burden to be carried) concerning the Desert of the [^b]Sea (the seasonally flooded plains just south of Babylon): As windstorms in the Negev (the South) sweep through, So it (God's judgment) comes from the desert, from [the hostile armies of] a terrifying land. 















###### 2 







A harsh vision has been shown to me; The treacherous one deals treacherously, and the destroyer destroys. Go up, Elam! Lay siege, Media! All the groaning [caused by Babylon's ruthless oppressions] I [the LORD] have brought to an end. 















###### 3 







Therefore [continues Isaiah] my loins are filled with anguish; Pains have seized me like the pains of a woman in childbirth; I am so bent _and_ bewildered that I cannot hear, I am so terrified that I cannot see. 















###### 4 







My mind reels, horror overwhelms me; The twilight I longed for has been [^c]turned into fear _and_ trembling for me. 















###### 5 







They set the table [for the doomed banquet], they spread out the cloth, they eat, they drink; "Rise up, captains [of Belshazzar's court], oil your shields [for battle, for your enemy is at the gates]!" 















###### 6 







This is what the Lord says to me, "Go, station the lookout, let him report what he sees. 















###### 7 







"When he sees a chariot, horsemen in pairs, A train of donkeys and a train of camels, Let him pay attention _and_ listen closely, very closely." 















###### 8 







And the lookout called _like_ a lion, "O Lord, I stand continually on the watchtower by day, And I am stationed every night at my guard post. 















###### 9 







"Now look! Here comes a troop of riders, horsemen in pairs." And one said, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon; And all the carved images of her gods are shattered on the ground." 















###### 10 







O my threshed _people_ [Judah, who must be judged and trampled down by Babylon], my afflicted of the threshing floor. What I have heard from the LORD of hosts, The God of Israel, I have [joyfully] announced to you [that Babylon is to fall]. ## Oracles about Edom and Arabia 















###### 11 







The [mournful, inspired] oracle ([^d]a burden to be carried) concerning Dumah (Edom): Someone keeps calling to me from Seir (Edom), "Watchman, what is left of the night [of Assyrian oppression]? Watchman, what is left of the night? [How long until morning?]" 















###### 12 







The watchman says, "The morning comes [only briefly], but also [comes] the night [of Babylonian oppression]. If you would ask [of me then], ask [again, if Edom really wishes to know]; Come back again." 















###### 13 







The [mournful, inspired] oracle ([^e]a burden to be carried) concerning Arabia: In the thickets of Arabia you must spend the night, Caravans of Dedanites. 















###### 14 







Bring water for the thirsty [Dedanites], O inhabitants of the land of Tema [in Arabia]; Meet the fugitive with bread. 















###### 15 







For they have fled from the swords, From the drawn sword, from the bent bow And from the press of battle _and_ grief of war. 















###### 16 







For the Lord has said this to me, "Within a year, according to the years of a hired man [who will work no longer than was agreed], all the splendor of [the tribe of] Kedar will end; 















###### 17 







and the remainder of the number of archers, the mighty men of the sons of Kedar, will be few; for the LORD, the God of Israel, has spoken." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

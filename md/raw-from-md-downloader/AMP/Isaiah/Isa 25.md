# Isaiah 25

***
















###### 1 







O LORD, You are my God; I will exalt You, I will praise _and_ give thanks to Your name; For You have done miraculous things, Plans _formed_ long, long ago, [fulfilled] with perfect faithfulness. 















###### 2 







For You have made a city into a heap [of trash], A fortified city into a ruin; A palace of [^a]foreigners is no longer a city, It will never be rebuilt. 















###### 3 







Therefore a strong people will honor You; Cities of terrible _and_ violent nations will fear You. 















###### 4 







For You have been a stronghold for the helpless, A stronghold for the poor in his distress, A shelter from the storm, a shade from the heat; For the breath of tyrants Is like a rainstorm _against_ a wall. 















###### 5 







Like heat in a dry land, You will subdue the noise of foreigners [rejoicing over their enemies]; Like heat in the shadow of a cloud, the song of the tyrants is [^b]silenced. 















###### 6 







On this mountain [Zion] the LORD of hosts will prepare a lavish banquet for all peoples [to welcome His reign on earth], A banquet of aged wines--choice pieces [flavored] with marrow, Of refined, aged wines. 















###### 7 







And on this mountain He will destroy the covering that is [cast] over all peoples, And the veil [of death] that is woven _and_ spread over all the nations. 















###### 8 







He will swallow up death [and abolish it] for all time. And the Lord God will wipe away tears from all faces, And He will take away the disgrace of His people from all the earth; For the LORD has spoken. 















###### 9 







It will be said in that day, "Indeed, this is our God for whom we have waited that He would save us. This is the LORD for whom we have waited; Let us shout for joy and rejoice in His salvation." 















###### 10 







For the hand of the LORD will rest on this mountain [Zion], And Moab will be trampled down in his place As straw is trampled down in the [filthy] water of a manure pile. 















###### 11 







And Moab will spread out his hands in the middle of the filth As a swimmer spreads out _his hands_ to swim, But _the Lord_ will humiliate his pride in spite of the [skillful] movements of his hands. 















###### 12 







The high fortifications of your walls He will bring down, Lay low, and cast to the ground, to the dust. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Isaiah 26

***
















###### 1 







In that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah: "We have a strong city; He sets up salvation as walls and ramparts. 















###### 2 







"Open the gates, that the righteous nation may enter, The one that [^a]remains faithful _and_ trustworthy. 















###### 3 







"You will keep in [^b]perfect _and_ constant peace _the one_ whose mind is steadfast [that is, committed and focused on You--in both [^c]inclination and character], Because he trusts _and_ takes refuge in You [with hope and confident expectation]. 















###### 4 







"Trust [confidently] in the LORD forever [He is your fortress, your shield, your banner], For the Lord God is an everlasting Rock [the Rock of Ages]. 















###### 5 







"For He has thrown down the [arrogant] ones who dwell on high, the lofty _and_ inaccessible city; He lays it low, He lays it low to the ground, He hurls it to the dust. 















###### 6 







"The foot will trample it, _Even_ the feet of the suffering, and the steps of the helpless." 















###### 7 







The way of the righteous [those in right-standing with God--living in moral and spiritual integrity] is smooth _and_ level; O Upright One, make a level path for the just _and_ righteous. 















###### 8 







Indeed, in the path of Your judgments, O LORD, We have waited expectantly for You; Your name, even Your memory, is the desire _and_ deep longing of our souls. 















###### 9 







In the night my soul longs for You [O LORD], Indeed, my spirit within me seeks You diligently; For [only] when Your judgments are experienced on the earth Will the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness. 















###### 10 







_Though_ the wicked is shown compassion _and_ favor, He does not learn righteousness; In the land of uprightness he deals unjustly, And refuses to see the majesty of the LORD. 















###### 11 







_Though_ Your hand is lifted up [to strike], O LORD, the wicked do not see it. Let them see Your zeal for _Your_ people and be put to shame; Indeed, let the fire reserved for Your enemies consume them. 















###### 12 







LORD, You will establish peace for us, Since You have also performed for us all that we have done. 















###### 13 







O LORD our God, other masters besides You have ruled over us; But through You alone we confess Your name. 















###### 14 







The [wicked] dead will not live [again], the spirits of the dead will not rise _and_ return; Therefore You have punished and destroyed them, And You have wiped out every memory of them [every trace of them]. 















###### 15 







You have increased the nation, O LORD; You have increased the nation, You are glorified; You have extended all the borders of the land. 















###### 16 







O LORD, they sought You in distress; They managed only a prayerful whisper When Your discipline was upon them. 















###### 17 







As a woman with child approaches _the time_ to give birth, She is in pain _and_ struggles and cries out in her labor, So we were before You, O LORD. 















###### 18 







We have been with child, we have twisted _and_ struggled _in labor_; We gave birth, as it seems, _only_ to wind. We could not accomplish salvation for the earth, Nor were inhabitants of the world [^d]born. 















###### 19 







Your dead will live; [^e]Their dead bodies will rise. You who lie in the dust, awake and shout for joy! For your dew is a dew of [celestial] light [heavenly, supernatural], And the earth will give birth to the spirits of the dead. 















###### 20 







Come, my people, enter your chambers And shut your doors behind you; Hide for a little while Until the [Lord's] [^f]wrath is past. 















###### 21 







Listen carefully, the LORD is about to come out of His [heavenly] place To punish the inhabitants of the earth for their wickedness [their sin, their injustice, their wrongdoing]; The earth will reveal the [innocent] blood shed upon her And will no longer cover her slain. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: Isaiah 26:3 Lit _peace, peace_, a Hebrew idiom of emphasis. [^c]: Isaiah 26:3 The Hebrew word for _inclination_ became a technical term in Jewish tradition, and the rabbis frequently referred to the “evil inclination” much in the same sense as the sin nature. They also recognized a “good inclination,” which the righteous choose to follow, and urged people to make their good inclination king over the evil inclination. [^d]: Isaiah 26:18 Lit _fallen_. [^e]: Isaiah 26:19 So with some ancient versions; MT reads _My dead body_. [^f]: Isaiah 26:20 Lit _curse_.

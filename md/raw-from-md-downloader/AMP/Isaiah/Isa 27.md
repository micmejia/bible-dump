# Isaiah 27

***
















###### 1 







In that day the Lord will punish Leviathan the fleeing serpent With His fierce and great and mighty sword [rescuing Israel from her enemy], Even Leviathan the twisted serpent; And He will kill the dragon who _lives_ in the sea. 















###### 2 







In that day [it will be said of the redeemed nation of Israel], "A vineyard of [^a]wine, sing in praise of it! 















###### 3 







"I, the LORD, am its Keeper; I water it every moment. So that no one will harm it, I guard it night and day. 















###### 4 







"I have no wrath. Should anyone give Me briars _and_ thorns in battle, I would step on them, I would set them all on fire. 















###### 5 







"Or let him (Israel) cling to My strength _and_ rely on My protection [My stronghold], Let him make peace with Me, Let him make peace with Me." 















###### 6 







[^b]In the generations to come Jacob will take root; Israel will blossom and sprout, And they will fill the surface of the world with fruit. 















###### 7 







Like the striking [^c]by Him who has struck them, has He struck them? Or like the slaughter of His slain, have they been slain? 















###### 8 







You contended with them by exile, by driving them away [from Canaan]; He has expelled them with His fierce wind on the day of the east wind. 















###### 9 







Therefore through this the wickedness [the sin, the injustice, the wrongdoing] of Jacob (Israel) will be atoned for _and_ forgiven; And this will be [^d]the full price [that God requires] for taking away his sin: When Israel makes all the stones of the [pagan] altars like crushed chalk stones; When the Asherim and the incense altars will not stand. 















###### 10 







For the fortified city is isolated, A settlement deserted and abandoned like the desert; There the calf will graze, And there it will lie down and [^e]feed on its branches. 















###### 11 







When its branches are dry, they are broken off; The women come and [^f]make a fire with them. For they are not a people of understanding, Therefore He who made them will not have compassion on them, And He who created them will not be gracious to them. 















###### 12 







In that day the LORD will thresh [out His grain] from the flowing stream of the River [Euphrates] to the Brook of Egypt, and you will be gathered up one by one, O sons of Israel. 















###### 13 







It will come to pass in that day that a great trumpet will be blown, and those who were lost _and_ perishing in the land of Assyria and who were scattered in the land of Egypt will come and worship the LORD on the holy mountain at Jerusalem. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

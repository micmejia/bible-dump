# Isaiah 3

***
















###### 1 







Listen carefully, the Lord God of hosts is removing from Jerusalem and from Judah Both supply and support, the whole supply of bread And the whole supply of water; 















###### 2 







The brave man and the warrior [He is also removing], The judge and the prophet, The diviner and the elder, 















###### 3 







The captain of fifty and the man of honor, The counselor and the expert artisan, And the skillful enchanter. 















###### 4 







And I will make _mere_ boys their princes, And capricious (impulsive, unpredictable) children will rule over them. 















###### 5 







And the people will be oppressed, Each one by another, and each one by his neighbor; The boy will be arrogant _and_ insolent toward the elder And the vulgar (common) toward the honorable [person of rank]. 















###### 6 







When a man takes hold of his brother in the house of his father, _saying_, "You have a robe, you shall be our judge _and_ ruler, And this pile of ruins will be under your control," 















###### 7 







He will protest on that day, saying, "I will not be a [^a]governor; For in my house there is neither bread nor clothing; You should not make me a judge _and_ ruler of the people." 















###### 8 







For Jerusalem has stumbled and Judah has fallen, Because their words and their actions are against the LORD, To rebel against His glorious presence _and_ defiantly provoke Him. 















###### 9 







Their partiality testifies against them, They display their sin like Sodom; They do not even hide it. Woe (judgment is coming) to [^b]them! For they have brought evil on themselves [as a reward]. 















###### 10 







Say to the righteous that _it will go_ well with them, For they will eat the fruit of their [righteous] actions. 















###### 11 







Woe (judgment is coming) to the wicked! _It shall go_ badly _with him_, For what his hand has done shall be done to him. 















###### 12 







O My people! Children are their oppressors, And women rule over them. O My people! Your leaders lead you astray And confuse (destroy, swallow up) the direction of your paths. ## God Will Judge 















###### 13 







The LORD rises to contend, And stands to judge the people. 















###### 14 







The LORD enters into judgment with the elders of His people and their princes, "For it is you who have devoured the vineyard [with your oppression, you have robbed the people and ruined the country]; The plunder of the poor is in your houses. 















###### 15 







"What do you mean by crushing My people And grinding the face of the poor?" Declares the Lord God of hosts. ## Judah's Women Denounced 















###### 16 







Moreover, the LORD said, "Because the daughters of Zion are proud And walk with outstretched necks and seductive (flirtatious, alluring) eyes, And trip along with mincing steps _and_ an affected gait And walk with jingling [^c]anklets on their feet, 















###### 17 







Therefore the Lord will afflict the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion with scabs [making them bald], And the LORD will expose their foreheads (send them into captivity)." 















###### 18 







In that day the Lord will take away the beauty of their anklets, [braided] caps, crescent [head] ornaments, 















###### 19 







dangling earrings, bracelets, and the hanging veils _and_ scarves, 















###### 20 







head wraps (turbans), [short, jingling] ankle chains, sashes, perfume boxes, amulets (charms), 















###### 21 







signet [finger] rings, nose rings, 















###### 22 







festival robes, outer tunics, shawls, handbags, 















###### 23 







hand mirrors, [fine linen] undergarments, headbands, and veils [covering the entire body]. 















###### 24 







Now it will come to pass that instead of the sweet fragrance of spices there will be [the stench of] rottenness; Instead of a belt, a rope; Instead of well-set hair, baldness; Instead of fine clothes, a robe of sackcloth; And branding [of captives by the scorching heat] instead of beauty. 















###### 25 







Your men will fall by the sword And your mighty men in battle. 















###### 26 







And Jerusalem's gates will lament (cry out in grief) and mourn [as those who wail for the dead]; And she, being ruined _and_ desolate, will sit upon the ground. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

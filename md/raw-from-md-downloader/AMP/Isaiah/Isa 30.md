# Isaiah 30

***
















###### 1 







"Woe (judgment is coming) to the rebellious children," declares the LORD, "Who carry out a plan, but not Mine, And make an alliance [by pouring out a libation], but not of My Spirit, In order to add sin to sin; 















###### 2 







Who proceed down to Egypt Without consulting [^a]Me, To take refuge in the stronghold of Pharaoh And to take shelter in the shadow of Egypt! 















###### 3 







"Therefore the safety _and_ protection of Pharaoh will be your shame And the refuge in the shadow of Egypt, your humiliation _and_ disgrace. 















###### 4 







"For his princes are at Zoan And his ambassadors arrive at Hanes [in Egypt]. 















###### 5 







"All will be ashamed because of a people (the Egyptians) who cannot benefit them, Who are not a help or benefit, but a shame and also a disgrace." 















###### 6 







A [mournful, inspired] oracle ([^b]a burden to be carried) concerning the beasts of the Negev (the South): Through a land of trouble and anguish, From [^c]where _come_ lioness and lion, viper and [fiery] flying serpent, They carry their riches on the shoulders of young donkeys And their treasures on the humps of camels, To a people (Egyptians) who cannot benefit them. 















###### 7 







For Egypt's help is worthless and good for nothing. Therefore, I have called her "Rahab Who Has Been Exterminated." 















###### 8 







Now, go, write it on a tablet before them And inscribe it on a scroll, So that it may serve in the time to come As a witness [against them] forevermore. 















###### 9 







For this is a rebellious people, lying sons, Sons who refuse to listen to The law _and_ instruction of the LORD; 















###### 10 







Who say to the seers, "You must not see _visions from God_"; And to the prophets, "You must not prophesy to us what is right! Speak to us pleasant things _and_ smooth words, Prophesy [deceitful] illusions [that we will enjoy]. 















###### 11 







"Get out of the [true] way, turn aside from the path [of God], Stop bothering us with the Holy One of Israel." 















###### 12 







Therefore, the Holy One of Israel says this, "Because you have refused _and_ rejected this word [of Mine] And have put your trust in oppression and guile, and have relied on them, 















###### 13 







Therefore this wickedness [this sin, this injustice, this wrongdoing] will be to you Like a crack [in a wall] about to fall, A bulge in a high wall, Whose collapse comes suddenly in an instant, 















###### 14 







"Whose collapse is like the smashing of a potter's jar, Crushed so savagely that there cannot be found among its pieces a potsherd [large enough] To take [coals of] fire from a fireplace, Or to scoop water from a cistern." 















###### 15 







For the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel has said this, "In returning [to Me] and rest you shall be saved, In quietness and confident trust is your strength." But you were not willing, 















###### 16 







And you said, "No! We will flee on horses!" Therefore you will flee [from your enemies]! And [you said], "We will ride on swift horses!" Therefore those who pursue you shall be swift. 















###### 17 







A thousand _of you will flee_ at the threat of one _man_; You will flee at the threat of five, Until you are left like a flag on the top of a mountain, And like a signal on a hill. ## God Is Gracious and Just 















###### 18 







Therefore the LORD waits [expectantly] _and_ longs to be gracious to you, And therefore He waits on high to have compassion on you. [^d]For the LORD is a God of justice; Blessed (happy, fortunate) are all those who long for Him [since He will never fail them]. 















###### 19 







[^e]O people in Zion, inhabitant in Jerusalem, you will weep no longer. He will most certainly be gracious to you at the sound of your cry for help; when He hears it, He will answer you. 















###### 20 







Though the Lord gives you the bread of adversity and the water of oppression, yet your Teacher will no longer hide Himself, but your eyes will [constantly] see your Teacher. 















###### 21 







Your ears will hear a word behind you, "This is the way, walk in it," whenever you turn to the right or to the left. 















###### 22 







And you will defile your carved images overlaid with silver, and your cast images plated with gold. You will scatter them like a bloodstained _cloth_, and will say to them, "Be gone!" 















###### 23 







Then He will give you rain for the seed with which you sow the ground, and bread [grain] from the produce of the ground, and it will be rich and plentiful. In that day your livestock will graze in large _and_ roomy pastures. 















###### 24 







Also the oxen and the young donkeys that work the ground will eat salted fodder, which has been winnowed with shovel and pitchfork. 















###### 25 







On every lofty mountain and on every high hill there will be streams of water on the day of the great slaughter (the day of the LORD), when the towers fall [and all His enemies are destroyed]. 















###### 26 







The light of the full moon will be like the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be seven times _brighter_, like the light of seven days [concentrated in one], in the day the LORD binds up the fracture of His people and heals the wound He has inflicted [because of their sins]. 















###### 27 







Now look, the [^f]name of the LORD comes from far away, Burning with His anger, and heavy with [^g]smoke; His lips are full of [^h]indignation, And His tongue is like a consuming fire. 















###### 28 







His breath is like an overflowing river, Which reaches to the neck, To sift the nations back and forth in a sieve [of disaster], And _to put_ in the jaws of the peoples the bridle which leads to ruin. 















###### 29 







You will have a song as in the night when a holy feast is kept, And joy of heart as when one marches [in procession] with a flute, To go to the [temple on the] mountain of the LORD, to the Rock of Israel. 















###### 30 







And the LORD will make His majestic voice heard, And show the descending of His arm [striking] in [His] fierce anger, And in the flame of a devouring fire, In the crashing sound _of heavy rain_, cloudburst, and hailstones. 















###### 31 







For at the voice of the LORD the Assyrians will be terrified, _When_ He strikes [them] with the rod. 















###### 32 







And every blow of the rod of punishment, Which the LORD will lay on them, Will be to _the music of Israel's_ tambourines and lyres; And in battles, brandishing weapons, He will fight Assyria. 















###### 33 







For [^i]Topheth [in Hinnom] has long been ready; Indeed, it has been prepared for the [Assyrian] king. He has made it deep and wide, A pit of fire with plenty of wood; The breath of the LORD, like a river of brimstone (blazing sulfur), kindles _and_ fans it. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

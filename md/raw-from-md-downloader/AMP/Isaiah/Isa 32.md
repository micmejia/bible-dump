# Isaiah 32

***
















###### 1 







Behold, a [^a]King will reign in righteousness, And princes will rule with justice. 















###### 2 







Each [one of them] will be like a hiding place from the wind And a shelter from the storm, Like streams of water in a dry land, Like the shade of a huge rock in a parched _and_ weary land [to those who turn to them]. 















###### 3 







Then the eyes of those who see will not be blinded, And the ears of those who hear will listen attentively. 















###### 4 







The heart (mind) of those who act impulsively will discern the truth, And the tongue of the stammerers will hurry to speak clearly. 















###### 5 







The fool (the good-for-nothing) will no longer be called noble, Nor the rogue said to be generous. 















###### 6 







For the fool speaks nonsense, And his heart (mind) plans wickedness: To practice ungodliness and to speak error concerning the LORD, To keep the craving of the hungry unsatisfied And to deprive the thirsty of drink. 















###### 7 







As for the rogue, his weapons are evil; He conceives wicked plans To ruin the poor with lies, Even when the plea of the needy one is just _and_ right. 















###### 8 







But the noble man conceives noble _and_ magnificent things; And he stands by what is noble _and_ magnificent. 















###### 9 







Rise up, you women who are carefree, And hear my voice, You confident _and_ unsuspecting daughters! Listen to what I am saying. 















###### 10 







In little more than a year You will tremble [with anxiety], you unsuspecting _and_ complacent women; For the vintage has ended, And the harvest will not come. 















###### 11 







Tremble, you women who are carefree; Tremble with fear, you complacent ones! Strip, undress and wear _sackcloth_ on your waist [in grief], 















###### 12 







Beat your breasts [in mourning] for the beautiful fields, for the fruitful vine, 















###### 13 







For the land of my people growing over with thorns and briars-- Yes, [mourn] for all the houses of joy in the joyous city. 















###### 14 







For the palace has been abandoned, the populated city deserted; The hill [of the city] and the watchtower have become caves [for wild animals] forever, A delight for wild donkeys, a pasture for flocks, 















###### 15 







Until the Spirit is poured out upon us from on high, And the wilderness becomes a fertile field, And the fertile field is valued as a forest. 















###### 16 







Then justice will dwell in the wilderness, And righteousness will live in the fertile field. 















###### 17 







And the effect of righteousness will be peace, And the result of righteousness will be quietness and confident trust forever. 















###### 18 







Then my people will live in a peaceful surrounding, And in secure dwellings and in undisturbed resting places. 















###### 19 







But it will hail, when the forest comes down, And the [capital] city will fall in utter humiliation. 















###### 20 







Blessed (happy, fortunate) are you who cast your seed upon all waters [[^b]when the river overflows its banks and irrigates the land], You who allow the ox and the donkey to roam freely. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: Isaiah 32:20 This verse is challenging to interpret; the ancient rabbis allegorized it, interpreting the sowing as acts of charity and the waters as the Torah.

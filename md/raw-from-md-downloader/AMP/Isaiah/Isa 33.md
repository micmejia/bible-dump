# Isaiah 33

***
















###### 1 







Woe (judgment is coming) to you, O destroyer, You who were not destroyed, And he who is treacherous, while _others_ did not deal treacherously with him. As soon as you finish destroying, you will be destroyed; As soon as you stop dealing treacherously, _others_ will deal treacherously with you. 















###### 2 







O LORD, be gracious to us; we have waited [expectantly] for You. Be the arm of Your servants every morning [that is, their strength and their defense], Our salvation also in the time of trouble. 















###### 3 







At the sound of the tumult, the peoples flee; At the lifting up of Yourself nations scatter. 















###### 4 







Your spoil [of Israel's foe] is gathered [by the people of Jerusalem] as the caterpillar gathers; As locusts swarming so people swarm on it. 















###### 5 







The LORD is exalted, for He dwells on high; He has filled Zion with justice and righteousness. 















###### 6 







And He will be the security _and_ stability of your times, A treasure of salvation, wisdom and knowledge; The fear of the LORD is your treasure. 















###### 7 







Now look, their brave men shout outside; The ambassadors [seeking a treaty] of peace weep bitterly. 















###### 8 







The highways are deserted, the traveler has ceased [to appear]. _The enemy_ has broken the covenant, he has rejected the [^a]cities, He has no regard for [any] man. 















###### 9 







The land mourns and dries out, Lebanon is shamed and [its lush foliage] withers; [^b]Sharon is like a desert plain, And [^c]Bashan and [Mount] Carmel shake off _their leaves_. 















###### 10 







"Now I will arise," says the LORD. "Now I will be exalted; now I will be lifted up. 















###### 11 







"You have conceived dried grass, you will give birth to stubble; My breath is a fire that will consume you. 















###### 12 







"The peoples will be burned to lime, Like thorns cut down which are burned in the fire. 















###### 13 







"You who are far away, hear what I have done; And you who are near, acknowledge My might." 















###### 14 







The sinners in Zion are terrified; Trembling has seized the godless. [They cry] "Who among us can live with the consuming fire? Who among us can live with everlasting burning?" 















###### 15 







He who walks righteously and speaks with integrity, Who rejects gain from fraud _and_ from oppression, Who shakes his hand free from the taking of bribes, Who stops his ears from hearing about bloodshed And shuts his eyes to avoid looking upon evil; 















###### 16 







He will dwell on the heights, His place of defense will be the fortress of rocks, His bread will be given him; His water will be permanent. 















###### 17 







Your eyes will see the King in His beauty; They will see a far-distant land. 















###### 18 







Your mind will meditate on the terror [asking]: "Where is he who counts? Where is he who weighs [the tribute]? Where is he who counts the towers?" 















###### 19 







You will no longer see the fierce _and_ insolent people, A people of unintelligible speech which no one comprehends, Of a strange _and_ stammering tongue which no one understands. 















###### 20 







Look upon Zion, the city of our appointed feasts _and_ observances; Your eyes will see Jerusalem, a undisturbed settlement, A tent which will not be taken down; Not one of its stakes will ever be pulled up, Nor any of its ropes be severed. 















###### 21 







But there the mighty _and_ magnificent LORD will be for us A place of broad rivers and streams, Where no oar-driven boat will go, And on which no mighty _and_ stately ship will pass. 















###### 22 







For the LORD is our Judge, The LORD is our Ruler, The LORD is our King; He will save us. 















###### 23 







Your ship's ropes (tackle) hang loose; They cannot hold the base of their mast firmly, Nor spread out the sail. Then an abundance of spoil and plunder will be divided; Even the lame will take the plunder. 















###### 24 







And no inhabitant [of Zion] will say, "I am sick"; The people who dwell there will be forgiven their wickedness [their sin, their injustice, their wrongdoing]. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

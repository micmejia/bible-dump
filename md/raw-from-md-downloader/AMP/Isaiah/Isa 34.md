# Isaiah 34

***
















###### 1 







Come near, you nations, to hear; and listen, O peoples! Let the earth and all that is in it hear, and the world and all that comes forth from it. 















###### 2 







For the LORD is angry at all the nations, And _His_ wrath is against all their armies; He has [^a]utterly doomed them, He has given them over to slaughter. 















###### 3 







So their slain will be thrown out, And the stench of their corpses will rise, And the mountains will flow with their blood. 















###### 4 







All the host of heaven will be dissolved, And the skies will be rolled up like a scroll; All their hosts [the stars and the planets] will also wither away As a leaf withers from the vine, And as a _fig_ withers from the fig tree. 















###### 5 







For My sword is satiated [with blood] in heaven; Indeed, it will come down for judgment on Edom And on the people whom I have doomed for destruction. 















###### 6 







The sword of the LORD is filled with blood [from sacrifices], It drips with fat, with the blood of lambs and goats, With the fat of the kidneys of rams. For the LORD has a sacrifice in Bozrah (Edom's capital city) And a great slaughter in the land of Edom. 















###### 7 







Wild oxen will also fall with them And the young bulls with the strong bulls; And their land will be soaked with blood, And their dust made greasy with fat. 















###### 8 







For the LORD has a day of vengeance, A year of retribution for the cause of Zion. 















###### 9 







The streams [of Edom] will be turned into pitch, And its dust into brimstone, And its land will become burning pitch. 















###### 10 







The burning will not be quenched night or day; Its smoke will go up forever. From generation to generation it will lie in ruins; No one will ever again pass through it. 















###### 11 







But the pelican and the porcupine will take possession of it; The owl and the raven will dwell in it. And He will stretch over it (Edom) the measuring line of desolation And the plumb line of emptiness. 















###### 12 







Its nobles--there is no one there Whom they may proclaim king-- And all its princes will be nothing. 















###### 13 







Thorns will come up in its fortified palaces, Nettles and brambles in its fortified cities; It will be a haunt for jackals, An abode for ostriches. 















###### 14 







The creatures of the desert will encounter jackals And the [^b]hairy goat will call to its kind; Indeed, [^c]Lilith (night demon) will settle there And find herself a place of rest. 















###### 15 







There the arrow snake will make her nest and lay her eggs, And hatch them and gather _her young_ under her protection; Indeed, the birds of prey will be gathered there [to breed], Every one with its own kind. 















###### 16 







Seek from the book of the LORD, and read: Not one of these [creatures] will be missing; None will lack its mate. For His mouth has commanded, And His Spirit has gathered them. 















###### 17 







The LORD has cast the lot for them, And His hand has divided _and_ apportioned [^d]Edom to the wild beasts by measuring-line. They will possess it forever; From generation to generation they will dwell in it. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

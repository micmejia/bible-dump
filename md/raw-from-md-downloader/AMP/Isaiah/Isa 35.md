# Isaiah 35

***
















###### 1 







The wilderness and the dry land will be glad; The Arabah (desert) will shout in exultation and blossom Like the [^a]autumn crocus. 















###### 2 







It will blossom abundantly And rejoice with joy and singing. The glory of Lebanon will be given to it, The majesty of [Mount] Carmel and [the plain] of Sharon. They will see the glory of the LORD, The majesty _and_ splendor of our God. 















###### 3 







Encourage the exhausted, and make staggering knees firm. 















###### 4 







Say to those with an anxious _and_ panic-stricken heart, "Be strong, fear not! Indeed, your God will come with vengeance [for the ungodly]; The retribution of God will come, But He will save you." 















###### 5 







Then the eyes of the blind will be opened And the ears of the deaf will be unstopped. 















###### 6 







Then the lame will leap like a deer, And the tongue of the mute will shout for joy. For waters will break forth in the wilderness And streams in the desert. 















###### 7 







And the burning sand (mirage) will become a pool [of water] And the thirsty ground springs of water; In the haunt of jackals, [^b]where they lay resting, Grass becomes reeds and [^c]rushes. 















###### 8 







A highway will be there, and a roadway; And it will be called the Holy Way. The unclean will not travel on it, But it will be for those who walk on the way [the redeemed]; And fools will not wander _on it_. 















###### 9 







No lion will be there, Nor will any predatory animal come up on it; They will not be found there. But the redeemed will walk _there_. 















###### 10 







And the ransomed of the LORD will return And come to Zion with shouts of jubilation, And everlasting joy will be upon their heads; They will find joy and gladness, And sorrow and sighing will flee away. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

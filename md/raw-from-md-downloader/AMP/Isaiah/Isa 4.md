# Isaiah 4

***
















###### 1 







And in that day seven women will take hold of one man, saying, "We will eat our own food and wear [and provide] our own clothes; only let us be called by your name; take away our shame [of being unmarried]." 















###### 2 







In that day the Branch of the LORD will be splendid and glorious, and the fruit of the land will be excellent and lovely to those of Israel who have survived. 















###### 3 







It will come to pass that he who is left in Zion and remains in Jerusalem will be called holy (set apart for God)--everyone who is recorded for [eternal] life in Jerusalem. 















###### 4 







When the Lord has washed away the [moral] filth of the daughters of Zion and has cleansed the bloodstains of Jerusalem from her midst, by the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of burning, 















###### 5 







then the LORD will create over the entire site of Mount Zion and over her assemblies, a cloud by day, smoke, and the brightness of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory _and_ brilliance will be a canopy [a defense, a covering of His divine love and protection]. 















###### 6 







And there will be a pavilion for shade from the heat by day, and a refuge and a shelter from the storm and the rain. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Isaiah 40

***
















###### 1 







"Comfort, O comfort My people," says your God. 















###### 2 







"Speak [^a]tenderly to Jerusalem, And call out to her, that her time of compulsory service in warfare is finished, That her wickedness has been taken away [since her punishment is sufficient], That she has received from the Lord's hand Double [punishment] for all her sins." 















###### 3 







A voice of one is calling out, "Clear the way for the LORD in the wilderness [remove the obstacles]; Make straight _and_ smooth in the desert a highway for our God. 















###### 4 







"Every valley shall be raised, And every mountain and hill be made low; And let the rough ground become a plain, And the rugged places a broad valley. 















###### 5 







"And the glory _and_ majesty _and_ splendor of the LORD will be revealed, And all humanity shall see it together; For the mouth of the LORD has spoken it." 















###### 6 







A voice says, "Call out [prophesy]." Then he answered, "What shall I call out?" [The voice answered:] All humanity is [as frail as] grass, and all that makes it attractive [its charm, its loveliness] is [momentary] like the flower of the field. 















###### 7 







The grass withers, the flower fades, When the breath of the LORD blows upon it; Most certainly [all] the people are [like] grass. 















###### 8 







The grass withers, the flower fades, But the word of our God stands forever. 















###### 9 







O Zion, herald of good news, Get up on a high mountain. O Jerusalem, herald of good news, Lift up your voice with strength, Lift it up, do not fear; Say to the cities of Judah, "Here is your God!" 















###### 10 







Listen carefully, the Lord God will come with might, And His arm will rule for Him. Most certainly His reward is with Him, And His restitution accompanies Him. 















###### 11 







He will protect His flock like a shepherd, He will gather the lambs in His arm, He will carry them in His bosom; He will gently _and_ carefully lead those nursing their young. 















###### 12 







Who has measured the waters in the hollow of His hand, And marked off the heavens with a span [of the hand], And calculated the dust of the earth with a [^b]measure, And weighed the mountains in a balance And the hills in a pair of scales? 















###### 13 







Who has directed the Spirit of the LORD, Or has taught Him as His counselor? 















###### 14 







With whom did He consult and _who_ enlightened Him? _Who_ taught Him the path of justice and taught Him knowledge And informed Him of the way of understanding? 















###### 15 







In fact, the nations are like a drop from a bucket, And are regarded as a speck of dust on the scales; Now look, He lifts up the islands like fine dust. 















###### 16 







And [the forests of] Lebanon cannot supply sufficient _fuel_ to start a fire, Nor are its wild beasts enough for a burnt offering [worthy of the LORD]. 















###### 17 







All the nations are as nothing before Him, They are regarded by Him as less than nothing and meaningless. 















###### 18 







To whom then will you liken God? Or with what likeness will you compare Him? 















###### 19 







_As for_ the cast image (idol), a metalworker casts it, A goldsmith overlays it with gold And a silversmith _casts its_ silver chains. 















###### 20 







He who is too impoverished for _such_ an offering [to give to his god] Chooses a tree that will not rot; He seeks out for himself a skillful craftsman To [carve and] set up an idol that will not totter. 















###### 21 







Do you [who worship idols] not know? Have you not heard? Has it not been told to you from the beginning? Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth [the omnipotence of God and the stupidity of bowing to idols]? 















###### 22 







It is He who sits above the circle of the earth, And its inhabitants are like grasshoppers; [It is He] who stretches out the heavens like a veil And spreads them out like a tent to dwell in. 















###### 23 







It is He who reduces dignitaries to nothing, Who makes the judges (rulers) of the earth meaningless (useless). 















###### 24 







Scarcely have they been planted, Scarcely have they been sown, Scarcely has their stock taken root in the earth, But He merely blows on them, and they wither, And a strong wind carries them away like stubble. 















###### 25 







"To whom then will you compare Me That I would be his equal?" says the Holy One. 















###### 26 







Lift up your eyes on high And see who has created these _heavenly bodies_, The One who brings out their host by number, He calls them all by name; Because of the greatness of His might and the strength of His power, Not one is missing. 















###### 27 







Why, O Jacob, do you say, and declare, O Israel, "My way is hidden from the LORD, And the justice due me escapes the notice of my God"? 















###### 28 







Do you not know? Have you not heard? The Everlasting God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth Does not become tired or grow weary; There is no searching of His understanding. 















###### 29 







He gives strength to the weary, And to him who has no might He increases power. 















###### 30 







Even youths grow weary and tired, And vigorous young men stumble badly, 















###### 31 







But those who wait for the LORD [who expect, look for, and hope in Him] Will gain new strength _and_ renew their power; They will lift up their wings [and rise up close to God] like eagles [rising toward the sun]; They will run and not become weary, They will walk and not grow tired. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

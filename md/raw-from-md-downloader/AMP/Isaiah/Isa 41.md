# Isaiah 41

***
















###### 1 







"Listen to Me in silence, you islands _and_ coastlands, And let the nations gain their strength; Let them come near, then let them speak; Let us come together for judgment [and decide the issue between us concerning the enemy from the east]. 















###### 2 







"Who has stirred up _and_ put into action one from the east [the king of Persia, Cyrus the Great] Whom He calls in righteousness to His service _and_ whom victory meets at every step? The LORD turns nations over to him And subdues kings. He makes them like dust with his sword, Like wind-driven chaff with his bow. 















###### 3 







"He (Cyrus) pursues them and passes along safely, By a way his feet had not traveled before. 















###### 4 







"Who has performed and done this, Calling forth [and guiding the destinies of] the generations [of the nations] from the beginning? 'I, the LORD--the first, and with the last [existing before history began, the ever-present, unchanging God]--I am He.'" 















###### 5 







The islands _and_ coastlands have seen and they fear; The ends of the earth tremble; They have drawn near and have come. 















###### 6 







They each help his neighbor And say to his brother [as he fashions his idols], "Be of good courage!" 















###### 7 







So the craftsman encourages the goldsmith, And he who smooths _metal_ with the smith's hammer _encourages_ him who beats the anvil, Saying of the soldering (welding), "That is good"; And he fastens the idol with nails, So that it will not totter _nor_ be moved. 















###### 8 







"But you, Israel, My servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, The offspring of Abraham My friend, 















###### 9 







You whom I [the LORD] have [^a]taken from the ends of the earth, And called from its remotest parts And said to you, 'You are My servant, I have chosen you and have not rejected you [even though you are exiled]. 















###### 10 







'Do not fear [anything], for I am with you; Do not be afraid, for I am your God. I will strengthen you, be assured I will help you; I will certainly take hold of you with My righteous right hand [a hand of justice, of power, of victory, of salvation].' 















###### 11 







"Indeed, all those who are angry with you will be put to shame and humiliated; Those who strive against you will be as nothing and will perish. 















###### 12 







"You shall search for those who quarrel with you, but will not find them; They who war against you will be as nothing, as nothing at all. 















###### 13 







"For I the LORD your God keep hold of your right hand; [I am the Lord], Who says to you, 'Do not fear, I will help you.' 















###### 14 







"Do not fear, you worm Jacob, you men of Israel; I will help you," declares the LORD, "and your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel. 















###### 15 







"In fact, I have made of you a new, sharp [^b]threshing implement with sharp edges; You will thresh the mountains and crush them, And make the hills like chaff. 















###### 16 







"You will winnow them, and the wind will carry them away, And a high wind will scatter them; But you will rejoice in the LORD, You will glory in the Holy One of Israel. 















###### 17 







"The poor and needy are seeking water, but there is none; Their tongues are parched with thirst. I, the LORD, will answer them Myself; I, the God of Israel, will not neglect them. 















###### 18 







"I will open rivers on the barren heights And springs in the midst of the valleys; I will make the wilderness a reed-pool of water And the dry land springs of water. 















###### 19 







"I will put the cedar in the wilderness, The acacia, the myrtle and the olive tree; I will place the juniper in the desert Together with the box tree and the cypress, 















###### 20 







So that they may see and know, And consider and understand together, That the hand of the LORD has done this, That the Holy One of Israel has created it. 















###### 21 







"Present your case [for idols made by men's hands]," says the LORD. "Produce your evidence [of divinity]," Says the king of Jacob. 















###### 22 







Let them bring forward [their evidence] and tell us what is going to happen. Regarding the former events, tell what they were, That we may consider them and know their outcome; Or announce to us the things that are going to come. 















###### 23 







Tell us the things that are to come afterward, That we may know that you are gods; Indeed, you should do _something_ good or do evil, [^c]that we may be afraid and fear [you] together [as we observe the miracle]. 















###### 24 







Hear this! You [idols] are less than nothing, And your work is worthless; The worshiper who chooses you [as a god] is repulsive. 















###### 25 







"I have stirred up _and_ put into action [^d]one from the north [the king of Persia, Cyrus the Great], and he has come; From the rising of the sun he will call on My Name [in prayer]. And he will trample on [the Babylonian] officials as on mortar, Even as a potter treads clay." 















###### 26 







Who [among the idols] has declared this from the beginning, so that we could know? Or from earlier times, so that we could say, _"He is_ [unquestionably] right!"? In fact, there was no one who declared it, Indeed, there was no one who proclaimed it; There was no one at all who heard you speak [for you pagan gods are speechless]. 















###### 27 







"I was first to say to Zion, 'Listen carefully, here they are [the Jews who will be restored to their own land].' And to Jerusalem, 'I will provide a messenger (Isaiah) to bring the good news [[^e]that Cyrus will be stirred up _and_ put into action to save them].' 















###### 28 







"But when I look [on the pagan prophets and priests], there is no one [who could predict these events], And there is no counselor [^f]among them, Who, if I ask, can give an answer. 















###### 29 







"In fact, all of these [pagan prophets and priests] are false; Their works are worthless, Their cast images are [merely] wind and emptiness. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

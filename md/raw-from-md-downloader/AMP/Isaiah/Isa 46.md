# Isaiah 46

***
















###### 1 







Bel has bowed down, Nebo stoops over; Their idols are on the beasts [of burden] and on the cattle. Your burdens [of idols] are loaded [on them], Burdens on the weary _animals_. 















###### 2 







They stooped over, they have bowed down together; They could not rescue the burden [of their own idols], But have themselves gone into captivity. 















###### 3 







"Listen to Me," [says the LORD], "O house of Jacob, And all the remnant of the house of Israel, You who have been carried _by Me_ from your birth And have been carried [in My arms] from the womb, 















###### 4 







Even to _your_ old age I am He, And even to _your_ advanced old age I will carry you! I have made _you_, and I will carry _you_; Be assured I will carry _you_ and I will save _you_. 















###### 5 







"To whom would you liken Me And make Me equal and compare Me, That we may be alike? 















###### 6 







"Those who lavish gold from the bag And weigh out silver on the scales Hire a goldsmith, and he makes it _into_ a god; They bow down, indeed they worship it. 















###### 7 







"They lift it on their shoulders [in religious processions or into battle] and carry it; They set it in its place and _there_ it remains standing. It cannot move from its place. Even if one cries to it [for help], the idol cannot answer; It cannot save him from his distress. 















###### 8 







"Remember this, and take courage; Take it to heart, you rebellious _and_ disloyal people. 















###### 9 







"Remember [carefully] the former things [which I did] from ages past; For I am God, and there is no one else; _I am_ God, and there is no one like Me, 















###### 10 







Declaring the end _and_ the result from the beginning, And from ancient times the things which have not [yet] been done, Saying, 'My purpose will be established, And I will do all that pleases Me _and_ fulfills My purpose,' 















###### 11 







Calling a bird of prey from the east, From a far country, the man (Cyrus) of My purpose. Truly I have spoken; truly I will bring it to pass. I have planned it, _be assured_ I will do it. 















###### 12 







"Listen to Me, you stiff-necked _people_, You who are far from righteousness (right standing with God). 















###### 13 







"I bring near My righteousness [in the salvation of Israel], it is not far away; And My salvation will not delay. And I will grant salvation in Zion, And My glory for Israel. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Isaiah 50

***
















###### 1 







[^a]The LORD declares this; "Where is the certificate of divorce By which I have sent your mother away, [O Israel]? Or to which one of My creditors did I sell you [as slaves]? In fact, You were sold for your wickedness [your sin, your injustice, your wrongdoing], And for your transgressions your mother was sent away. 















###### 2 







"Why, when I came, was there no man [to greet Me]? When I called, why was there no one to answer? Is My hand really so short that it cannot redeem [My servants]? Or have I no power to rescue? Listen carefully, with My rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers into a desert; Their fish stink because there is no water And die of thirst. 















###### 3 







"I clothe the heavens with the blackness [of storm clouds] And make sackcloth [of mourning] their clothing." 















###### 4 







The Lord God has given Me [His [^b]Servant] the tongue of disciples [as One who is taught], That I may know how to sustain the weary with a word. He awakens _Me_ morning by morning, He awakens My ear to listen as a disciple [as One who is taught]. 















###### 5 







The Lord God has opened My ear, And I have not been rebellious Nor have I turned back. 















###### 6 







I turned My back to those who strike _Me_, And My cheeks to those who pluck out the beard; I did not hide My face from insults and spitting. 















###### 7 







For the Lord God helps Me, Therefore, I have not been ashamed _or_ humiliated. Therefore, I have made My face like flint, And I know that I shall not be put to shame. 















###### 8 







He who declares Me in the right is near; Who will [dare to] contend with Me? Let us stand up to each other; Who is My adversary? Let him approach Me. 















###### 9 







In fact, the Lord God helps Me; Who is he who condemns Me [as guilty]? Indeed, they will all wear out like a garment; The moth will eat them. 















###### 10 







Who is among you who fears the LORD, Who obeys the voice of His Servant, Yet who walks in darkness and has no light? Let him trust _and_ be confident in the name of the LORD and let him rely on his God. 















###### 11 







Listen carefully, all you who kindle your own fire [devising your own man-made plan of salvation], Who surround yourselves with torches, Walk by the light of your [self-made] fire And among the torches that you have set ablaze. But this you will have from My hand: You will lie down in [a place of] torment. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

They compared themselves to a wife divorced by her husband and to a slave sold by his master (referring to God as husband and master), claiming that they had no further obligations to God. [^b]: Isaiah 50:4 I.e. the Messiah.

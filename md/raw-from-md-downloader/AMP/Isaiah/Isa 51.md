# Isaiah 51

***
















###### 1 







"Listen to Me, you who pursue righteousness (right standing with God), Who seek _and_ inquire of the LORD: Look to the rock from which you were cut And to the excavation of the quarry from which you were dug. 















###### 2 







"Look to Abraham your father And to Sarah who gave birth to you in pain; For I called him when _he was but_ one, Then I blessed him and made him many." 















###### 3 







For the LORD will comfort Zion [in her captivity]; He will comfort all her ruins. And He will make her wilderness like Eden, And her desert like the garden of the LORD; Joy and gladness will be found in her, Thanksgiving and the voice of a melody. 















###### 4 







"Listen carefully to Me [says the LORD], O My people, And hear Me, O My nation; For a [divine] law will go forth from Me, And I will quickly _establish_ My justice as a light to the peoples. 















###### 5 







"My righteousness (justice) is near, My salvation has gone forth, And My arms will judge the peoples; The islands _and_ coastlands will wait for Me, And they will wait with hope _and_ confident expectation for My arm. 















###### 6 







"Lift up your eyes to the heavens, Then look to the earth beneath; For the heavens will be torn to pieces _and_ vanish like smoke, And the earth will wear out like a garment And its inhabitants will die in like manner. But My salvation will be forever, And My righteousness (justice) [and faithfully fulfilled promise] will not be broken. 















###### 7 







"Listen to Me, you who know righteousness (right standing with God), The people in whose heart is My law _and_ instruction; Do not fear the reproach _and_ taunting of man, Nor be distressed at their reviling. 















###### 8 







"For the moth will eat them like a garment, And the worm will eat them like wool. But My righteousness _and_ justice [faithfully promised] will exist forever, And My salvation to all generations." 















###### 9 







Awake, awake, put on strength _and_ might, O arm of the LORD; Awake as in the ancient days, as in the generations of long ago. Was it not You who cut Rahab (Egypt) in pieces, Who pierced the dragon [of Egypt]? 















###### 10 







Was it not You who dried up the [Red] Sea, The waters of the great deep, Who made the depths of the sea a pathway For the redeemed to cross over? 















###### 11 







So the redeemed of the LORD will return And come with joyful shouting to Zion; Everlasting joy will be on their heads. They will obtain gladness and joy, And sorrow and sighing will flee away. 















###### 12 







"I, even I, am He who comforts you. Who are you that you are afraid of man who dies And of a son of man who is made [as destructible] as grass, 















###### 13 







That you have forgotten the LORD your Maker, Who stretched out the heavens And laid the foundations of the earth, That you continually tremble with fear all day long because of the rage of the oppressor, As he takes aim to destroy? And where is the rage of the oppressor? 















###### 14 







The [captive] exile will soon be set free, and will not die in the dungeon, nor will his food be lacking. 















###### 15 







For I am the LORD your God, who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar--the LORD of hosts is His name. 















###### 16 







I have put My words in your mouth and have covered you with the shadow of My hand, to [^a]establish the [renewed] heavens and lay the foundations of the [renewed] earth, and to say to Zion (Jerusalem), 'You are My people.'" 















###### 17 







Wake yourself up! Wake yourself up! Stand up, O Jerusalem, You who have drunk at the hand of the LORD the cup of His wrath, You who have drunk the cup of staggering _and_ intoxication to the dregs [leaving only sediment]. 















###### 18 







There is no one to guide her among all the sons she has borne, Nor is there anyone to take her by the hand among all the sons she has reared. 















###### 19 







These two _tragedies_ have befallen you; Who will show sympathy for you _and_ mourn with you? The desolation and destruction [on the land and city], famine and sword [on the inhabitants]; How shall I comfort you? 















###### 20 







Your sons have fainted; They lie _helpless_ at the head of every street, Like an antelope in a net, Full [from drinking] of the wrath of the LORD, The rebuke of your God. 















###### 21 







Therefore, now hear this, you who are afflicted, Who are drunk, but not with wine [but overwhelmed by the wrath of God]. 















###### 22 







So says your Lord, the LORD, _who is_ also your God Who pleads the cause of His people, "Listen carefully, I have taken from your hand the cup of staggering _and_ intoxication, The cup of My wrath; You shall never drink it again. 















###### 23 







"I will put it into the hands of your tormentors, Who have said to you, 'Lie down so that we may walk over you.' You have even made your back like the ground And like the street for those who walk over it." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

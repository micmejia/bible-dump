# Isaiah 52

***
















###### 1 







Awake, awake, Put on your strength, O Zion; Put on your beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city; For the uncircumcised and the unclean Will no longer come into you. 















###### 2 







Shake yourself from the dust, arise, O captive Jerusalem; Rid yourself of the chains around your neck, O captive Daughter of Zion. 















###### 3 







For the LORD says this, "You were sold for nothing and you will be redeemed, but not with money." 















###### 4 







For the Lord God says this, "My people went down at the first into Egypt to live there; and [many years later Sennacherib] the Assyrian oppressed them without cause. 















###### 5 







But now, what do I have here," declares the LORD, "seeing that My people have been taken away without reason? Those who rule over them howl [with taunting and mockery of salvation]," declares the LORD, "and My name is continually blasphemed all day long. 















###### 6 







Therefore My people shall know My Name _and_ what it means. Therefore in that day I am the One who is speaking, 'Here I am.'" 















###### 7 







How beautiful _and_ delightful on the mountains Are the feet of him who brings good news, Who announces peace, Who brings good news of good [things], Who announces salvation, Who says to Zion, "Your God reigns!" 















###### 8 







Listen! Your watchmen lift up their voices, Together they shout for joy; For they will see face to face The return of the LORD to Zion. 















###### 9 







Break forth, shout joyfully together, You ruins of Jerusalem; For the LORD has comforted His people, He has redeemed Jerusalem. 















###### 10 







The LORD has bared His holy arm (His infinite power) Before the eyes of all the nations [revealing Himself as the One by Whom Israel is redeemed from captivity], That all the ends of the earth may see The salvation of our God. 















###### 11 







Depart, depart, go out from there (the lands of exile), Touch no unclean thing; Go out of the midst of her (Babylon), purify yourselves, You who carry the articles of the LORD [on your journey from there]. 















###### 12 







For you will not go out in a hurry [as when you left Egypt], Nor will you go in flight [fleeing, as you did from the Egyptians]; For the LORD will go before you, And the God of Israel will be your rear guard. ## The Exalted Servant 















###### 13 







Indeed, My Servant (the Messiah) will act wisely _and_ prosper; He will be raised and lifted up and greatly exalted. 















###### 14 







Just as many were astonished _and_ appalled at you, _My people_, So His appearance was marred more than any man And His form [marred] more than the sons of men. 















###### 15 







So He will sprinkle many nations [with His blood, providing salvation], Kings will shut their mouths because of Him; For what they had not been told they will see, And what they had not heard they will understand. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Isaiah 53

***
















###### 1 







Who has believed [confidently trusted in, relied on, and adhered to] our message [of salvation]? And to whom [if not us] has the arm _and_ infinite power of the LORD been revealed? 















###### 2 







For He [the Servant of God] grew up before Him like a tender shoot (plant), And like a root out of dry ground; He has no _stately_ form or _majestic_ splendor That we would look at Him, Nor [handsome] appearance that we would [^a]be attracted to Him. 















###### 3 







He was despised and rejected by men, A Man of sorrows _and_ pain and acquainted with grief; And like One from whom men hide their faces He was despised, and we did not appreciate His worth _or_ esteem Him. 















###### 4 







But [in fact] He has borne our griefs, And He has carried our sorrows _and_ pains; Yet we [ignorantly] assumed that He was stricken, Struck down by God and degraded _and_ humiliated [by Him]. 















###### 5 







But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was crushed for our wickedness [our sin, our injustice, our wrongdoing]; The punishment [required] for our well-being _fell_ on Him, And by His stripes (wounds) we are healed. 















###### 6 







All of us like sheep have gone astray, We have turned, each one, to his own way; But the LORD has caused the wickedness of us all [our sin, our injustice, our wrongdoing] To fall on Him [instead of us]. 















###### 7 







He was oppressed and He was afflicted, Yet He did not open His mouth [to complain or defend Himself]; Like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, And like a sheep that is silent before her shearers, So He did not open His mouth. 















###### 8 







[^b]After oppression and judgment He was taken away; And [^c]as for His generation [His contemporaries], who [among them] concerned himself _with the fact_ That He was cut off from the land of the living [by His death] For the transgression of my people, to whom the stroke [of death] _was due_? 















###### 9 







His grave was assigned with the wicked, But He was with a rich man in His death, Because He had done no violence, Nor was there any deceit in His mouth. 















###### 10 







Yet the LORD was [^d]willing To crush Him, [^e]causing Him to suffer; If [^f]He would give Himself as a guilt offering [an atonement for sin], He shall see _His_ [spiritual] offspring, He shall prolong _His_ days, And the will (good pleasure) of the LORD shall succeed _and_ prosper in His hand. 















###### 11 







As a result of the [^g]anguish of His soul, He shall see it and be satisfied; By His knowledge [of what He has accomplished] the Righteous One, My Servant, shall justify the many [making them righteous--upright before God, in right standing with Him], For He shall bear [the responsibility for] their sins. 















###### 12 







Therefore, I will divide _and_ give Him a portion with the great [kings and rulers], And He shall divide the spoils with the mighty, Because He [willingly] poured out His life to death, And was counted among the transgressors; Yet He Himself bore _and_ took away the sin of many, And interceded [with the Father] for the transgressors. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

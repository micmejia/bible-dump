# Isaiah 55

***
















###### 1 







"Everyone who thirsts, come to the waters; And you who have no money come, buy grain and eat. Come, buy wine and milk Without money and without cost [simply accept it as a gift from God]. 















###### 2 







"Why do you spend money for that which is not bread, And your earnings for what does not satisfy? Listen carefully to Me, and eat what is good, And let your soul delight in [^a]abundance. 















###### 3 







"Incline your ear [to listen] and come to Me; Hear, so that your soul may live; And I will make an everlasting covenant with you, _According to_ the faithful mercies [promised and] shown to David. 















###### 4 







"Listen carefully, I have appointed [^b]him [David, representing the Messiah] to be a witness to the nations [regarding salvation], A leader and commander to the peoples. 















###### 5 







"In fact, you [^c][Israel] will call a nation that you do not know, And a nation that does not know you will run to you, Because of the LORD your God, even the Holy One of Israel; For He has glorified you." 















###### 6 







Seek the LORD while He may be found; Call on Him [for salvation] while He is near. 















###### 7 







Let the wicked leave (behind) his way And the unrighteous man his thoughts; And let him return to the LORD, And He will have compassion (mercy) on him, And to our God, For He will abundantly pardon. 















###### 8 







"For My thoughts are not your thoughts, Nor are your ways My ways," declares the LORD. 















###### 9 







"For as the heavens are higher than the earth, So are My ways higher than your ways And My thoughts _higher_ than your thoughts. 















###### 10 







"For as the rain and snow come down from heaven, And do not return there without watering the earth, Making it bear and sprout, And providing seed to the sower and bread to the eater, 















###### 11 







So will My word be which goes out of My mouth; It will not return to Me void (useless, without result), Without accomplishing what I desire, And without succeeding _in the matter_ for which I sent it. 















###### 12 







"For you will go out [from exile] with joy And be led forth [by the LORD Himself] with peace; The mountains and the hills will break forth into shouts of joy before you, And all the trees of the field will clap their hands. 















###### 13 







"Instead of the thorn bush the cypress tree will grow, And instead of the nettle the myrtle tree will grow; And it will be a memorial to the LORD, For an everlasting sign [of His mercy] which will not be cut off." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

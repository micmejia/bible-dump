# Isaiah 56

***
















###### 1 







This is what the LORD says, "Maintain justice and do righteousness, For My salvation is soon to come, And My righteousness _and_ justice _is soon_ to be revealed. 















###### 2 







"Blessed (happy, fortunate) is the man who does this, And the son of man who takes hold of it, Who keeps the Sabbath without profaning it, And keeps his hand from doing any evil." 















###### 3 







Do not let the foreigner who has joined himself to the LORD say, "The LORD will most certainly separate me from His people." And do not let the eunuch say, "Look, I am a dry tree." 















###### 4 







This is what the LORD says, "To the eunuchs who keep My Sabbaths And choose what pleases Me, And hold firmly to My covenant, 















###### 5

###### 6

###### 7 







All these I will bring to My holy mountain And make them joyful in My house of prayer. Their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will [^a]be accepted on My altar; For My house will be called a house of prayer for all the peoples." 















###### 8 







The Lord God, who gathers the dispersed of Israel, declares: "I will gather yet _others_ to them (Israel), to those [already] gathered." 















###### 9 







All you beasts of the field, All you beasts (hostile nations) in the forest, Come to eat. 















###### 10 







Israel's watchmen are blind, They are all without knowledge. They are all mute dogs, they cannot bark; Panting, lying down, they love to slumber. 















###### 11 







And the dogs are greedy; they [^b]never have enough. They are shepherds who have no understanding; They have all turned to their own way, Each one to his unlawful gain, without exception. 















###### 12 







"Come," [they say,] "let us get wine, and let us fill ourselves with strong drink; And tomorrow will be like today, very great indeed." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Isaiah 57

***
















###### 1 







The righteous man perishes [at the hand of evil], and no one takes it to heart; Faithful _and_ devout men are taken away, while no one understands That the righteous person is taken away [to be spared] from disaster _and_ evil. 















###### 2 







He enters into peace [through death]; They rest in their beds (graves), _Each one_ who walked uprightly [following God's will, living with integrity]. 















###### 3 







"But come here, you sons of a sorceress [raised in deception and superstition], Offspring of an adulterer and a prostitute. 















###### 4 







"Of whom do you make fun? Against whom do you open wide your mouth And stick out your tongue? Are you not children of rebellion (sin), Offspring of deceit, 















###### 5 







Who inflame yourselves [with lust in pagan rites] among the oaks (terebinth trees), Under every green _and_ leafy tree, Who slaughter the children [in sacrifice] in the ravines Under the clefts of the rocks? 















###### 6 







"Among the smooth _stones_ of the ravine Is your portion, they (the idols) are your lot; Even to them you have poured out a drink offering, You have offered a grain offering. Should I be quiet concerning these things [leaving them unpunished--bearing them with patience]? 















###### 7 







"Upon a high and lofty mountain You have [openly and shamelessly] made your [idolatrous and adulterous] bed; Even there you went up to offer sacrifice [to idols, in spiritual unfaithfulness to Me]. 















###### 8 







"Behind the door and the doorpost You have set up your [pagan] symbol; Indeed, far removed from Me, you have uncovered yourself, And have gone up and made your bed wide. And you have made a [new] agreement for yourself with the adulterers, You have loved their bed, You have looked [with passion] on their [^a]manhood. 















###### 9 







"You have gone to [^b]the king [of a pagan land] with oil And increased your [^c]perfumes; You have sent your messengers a great distance And made _them_ go down to Sheol (the realm of the dead). 















###### 10 







"You were wearied by the length of your road, _Yet_ you did not say, 'It is no use.' You found [^d]renewed strength, Therefore you did not grow weak. 















###### 11 







"About whom were you worried and fearful That you lied and did not [^e]remember Me, Nor [^f]give Me a thought? Was I not silent even for a long time And [as a result] you do not fear Me? 















###### 12 







"I will declare your [hypocritical] righteousness and your deeds, But they will not benefit you. 















###### 13 







"When you cry out [for help], let your [ridiculous] collection _of idols_ save you. But the wind will carry them all away, A [mere] breath will take them. But he who takes refuge in Me will possess the land [Judea] And will inherit My holy mountain." 















###### 14 







And it will be said, "Build up, build up, clear the way. Remove the stumbling block out of the way [of the spiritual return] of My people." 















###### 15 







For the high and exalted One He who inhabits eternity, Whose name is Holy says this, "I dwell on the high and holy place, But _also_ with the [^g]contrite and humble in spirit In order to revive the spirit of the humble And to revive the heart of the contrite [overcome with sorrow for sin]. 















###### 16 







"For I will not contend forever, Nor will I always be angry; For [if I did stay angry] the spirit [of man] would grow weak before Me, And the breath _of those whom_ I have created. 















###### 17 







"Because of the wickedness of his unjust gain I was angry and struck him; I hid _My face_ and was angry, And he went on turning away _and_ backsliding, in the way of his [own willful] heart. 















###### 18 







"I have seen his [willful] ways, but I will heal him; I will lead him [also] and will restore comfort to him and to those who mourn for him, 















###### 19 







As I create the [^h]praise of his lips, Peace, peace, to him who is far away [both Jew and Gentile] and to him who is near!" Says the LORD; "And I will heal him [making his lips blossom anew with thankful praise]." 















###### 20 







But the wicked are like the tossing sea, For it cannot be quiet, And its waters toss up mire and mud. 















###### 21 







"There is no peace," says my God, "for the wicked." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

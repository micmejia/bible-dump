# Isaiah 58

***
















###### 1 







"Cry aloud, do not hold back; Lift up your voice like a trumpet, And declare to My people their transgression And to the house of Jacob their sins. 















###### 2 







"Yet they seek Me day by day and delight [superficially] to know My ways, As [if they were in reality] a nation that has done righteousness And has not abandoned (turned away from) the ordinance of their God. They ask of Me righteous judgments, They delight in the nearness of God. 















###### 3 







'Why have we fasted,' _they say_, 'and You do not see it? Why have we humbled ourselves and You do not notice?' Hear this [O Israel], on the day of your fast [when you should be grieving for your sins] you find _something you_ desire [to do], And you force your hired servants to work [instead of stopping all work, as the law teaches]. 















###### 4 







"The facts are that you fast _only_ for strife and brawling and to strike with the fist of wickedness. You do not fast as _you do_ today to make your voice heard on high. 















###### 5 







"Is a fast such as this what I have chosen, a day for a man to humble himself [with sorrow in his soul]? Is it _only_ to bow down his head like a reed And to make sackcloth and ashes as a bed [pretending to have a repentant heart]? Do you call this a fast and a day pleasing to the LORD? 















###### 6 







"[Rather] is this not the fast which I choose, To undo the bonds of wickedness, To tear to pieces the ropes of the yoke, To let the oppressed go free And break apart every [enslaving] yoke? 















###### 7 







"Is it not to divide your bread with the hungry And bring the homeless poor into the house; When you see the naked, that you cover him, And not to hide yourself from [the needs of] your own flesh _and_ blood? 















###### 8 







"Then your light will break out like the dawn, And your healing (restoration, new life) will quickly spring forth; Your righteousness will go before you [leading you to peace and prosperity], The glory of the LORD will be your rear guard. 















###### 9 







"Then you will call, and the LORD will answer; You will cry for help, and He will say, 'Here I am.' If you take away from your midst the yoke [of oppression], The finger pointed in scorn [toward the oppressed or the godly], and [every form of] wicked (sinful, unjust) speech, 















###### 10 







And if you offer yourself to [assist] the hungry And satisfy the [^a]need of the afflicted, Then your light will rise in darkness And your gloom _will become_ like midday. 















###### 11 







"And the LORD will continually guide you, And satisfy your soul in scorched _and_ dry places, And give strength to your bones; And you will be like a watered garden, And like a spring of water whose waters do not fail. 















###### 12 







"And your people will rebuild the ancient ruins; You will raise up _and_ restore the age-old foundations [of buildings that have been laid waste]; You will be called Repairer of the Breach, Restorer of Streets [^b]with Dwellings. ## Keeping the Sabbath 















###### 13 







"If you turn back your foot from [[^c]unnecessary travel on] the Sabbath, From doing your own pleasure on My holy day, And call the Sabbath a [spiritual] delight, and the holy day of the LORD honorable, And honor it, not going your own way Or [^d]engaging in your own pleasure Or speaking your own [idle] words, 















###### 14 







Then you will take pleasure in the LORD, And I will make you ride on the high places of the earth, And I will feed you with the [promised] heritage of Jacob your father; For the mouth of the LORD has spoken." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^c]: Isaiah 58:13 The ancient rabbis established strict limits for travel on the Sabbath, excepting unintentional violations and religious errands. This verse became a rabbinic proof text to rule on whether a person who had put one foot beyond the Sabbath limit for his city could reenter the city. But the Hebrew text may not refer to travel at all; _turn back your foot from the Sabbath_ can be interpreted as an idiom referring to keeping oneself from violating the Sabbath in other ways. [^d]: Isaiah 58:13 Lit _finding_.

# Isaiah 59

***
















###### 1 







Behold, the Lord's hand is not so short That it cannot save, Nor His ear so [^a]impaired That it cannot hear. 















###### 2 







But your wickedness has separated you from your God, And your sins have hidden _His_ face from you so that He does not hear. 















###### 3 







For your hands are defiled with blood And your fingers with wickedness [with sin, with injustice, with wrongdoing]; Your lips have spoken lies, Your tongue mutters wickedness. 















###### 4 







No one sues righteously [but for the sake of doing injury to others--to take some undue advantage], and no one pleads [his case] in truth; [but rather] They trust in empty _arguments_ and speak lies; They conceive trouble and bring forth injustice. 















###### 5 







They hatch vipers' eggs and weave the spider's webs; He who eats of their eggs dies, And _from an egg_ which is crushed a viper breaks out. 















###### 6 







Their webs will not serve as clothing, Nor will they cover themselves with what they make; Their works are works of wickedness [of sin, of injustice, of wrongdoing], And the act of violence is in their hands. 















###### 7 







Their feet run to evil, And they rush to shed innocent blood. Their thoughts are thoughts of wickedness [of sin, of injustice, of wrongdoing]; Devastation and destruction are in their highways. 















###### 8 







They do not know the way of peace, And there is no justice in their tracks. They have made them into crooked paths; Whoever walks on them does not know peace. ## A Confession of Wickedness 















###### 9 







Therefore justice is far from us, And righteousness does not overtake us. We [expectantly] hope for light, but only see darkness; _We hope_ for gleam of light, _but_ we walk in darkness _and_ gloom. 















###### 10 







We grope for a wall like the blind, We grope like those who have no eyes. We stumble at midday as in the twilight; Among those who are healthy _we are_ like dead men. 















###### 11 







We all groan _and_ growl like bears, And coo sadly like doves; We hope for justice, but there is none, For salvation, but it is far from us. 















###### 12 







For our transgressions are multiplied before You [O LORD], And our sins testify against us; For our transgressions are with us, And we know _and_ recognize our wickedness [our sin, our injustice, our wrongdoing]: 















###### 13 







Rebelling against and denying the LORD, Turning away from [following] our God, Speaking oppression and revolt, Conceiving and muttering from the heart lying words. 















###### 14 







Justice is pushed back, And righteous behavior stands far away; For truth has fallen in the city square, And [^b]integrity cannot enter. 















###### 15 







Yes, truth is missing; And he who turns away from evil makes himself a prey. Now the LORD saw it, And it [^c]displeased Him that there was no justice. 















###### 16 







He saw that there was no man, And was amazed that there was no one to intercede [on behalf of truth and right]; Therefore His own arm brought salvation to Him, And His own righteousness sustained Him. 















###### 17 







For He [the LORD] put on righteousness like a coat of armor, And salvation like a helmet on His head; He put on garments of vengeance for clothing And covered Himself with zeal [and great love for His people] as a cloak. 















###### 18 







As their deeds deserve, so He will repay: Wrath to His adversaries, retribution to His enemies; To the islands _and_ coastlands He will repay. 















###### 19 







So they will fear the name of the LORD from the west And His glory from the rising of the sun. For He will come in like a narrow, rushing stream Which the [^d]breath of the LORD drives [overwhelming the enemy]. 















###### 20 







"A Redeemer (Messiah) will come to Zion, And to those in Jacob (Israel) who turn from transgression (sin)," declares the LORD. 















###### 21 







"As for Me, this is My covenant with them," says the LORD: "My Spirit which is upon you [writing the law of God on the heart], and My words which I have put in your mouth shall not depart from your mouth, nor from the mouths of your [true, spiritual] [^e]children, nor from the mouth of your children's children," says the LORD, "from now and forever." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

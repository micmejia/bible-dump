# Isaiah 62

***
















###### 1 







For Zion's sake I (Isaiah) will not be silent, And for Jerusalem's sake I will not keep quiet, Until her righteousness _and_ vindication go forth as brightness, And her salvation goes forth like a burning torch. 















###### 2 







The nations will see your righteousness _and_ vindication [by God], And all kings [will see] your glory; And you will be called by a new name Which the mouth of the LORD will designate. 















###### 3 







You will also be [considered] a crown of glory _and_ splendor in the hand of the LORD, And a royal [^a]diadem [exceedingly beautiful] in the hand of your God. 















###### 4 







It will no longer be said of you [Judah], "Azubah (Abandoned)," Nor will it any longer be said of your land, "Shemamah (Desolate)"; But you will be called, "Hephzibah (My Delight is in Her)," And your land, "[^b]Married"; For the LORD delights in you, And _to Him_ your land will be married [owned and protected by the LORD]. 















###### 5 







For as a young man marries a virgin [O Jerusalem], [^c]So your sons will marry you; And as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, So your God will rejoice over you. 















###### 6 







On your walls, O Jerusalem, I have appointed _and_ stationed watchmen (prophets), Who will never keep silent day or night; You who profess the LORD, take no rest for yourselves, 















###### 7 







And give Him no rest [from your prayers] until He establishes Jerusalem And makes her a praise on the earth. 















###### 8 







The LORD has sworn [an oath] by His right hand and by His mighty arm, "I will never again give your grain as food for your enemies, Nor will [the invading] foreigners drink your new wine for which you have labored." 















###### 9 







But they who have harvested it will eat it and praise the LORD, And they who have gathered it will drink it [at the feasts celebrated] in the courtyards of My sanctuary. 















###### 10 







Go through, go through the gates, Clear the way for the people; Build up, build up the highway, Remove the stones, lift up a banner over the peoples. 















###### 11 







Listen carefully, the LORD has proclaimed to the end of the earth, Say to the Daughter of Zion, "Look now, your salvation is coming [in the LORD]; Indeed, His reward is with Him, and His restitution accompanies Him." 















###### 12 







And they will call them "The Holy People, The Redeemed of the LORD"; And you will be called "Sought Out, A City Not Deserted." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

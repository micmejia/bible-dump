# Isaiah 63

***
















###### 1 







Who is this who comes from Edom, With crimson-stained garments from Bozrah [in Edom], This One (the Messiah) who is majestic in His apparel, Marching in the greatness of His might? "It is I, [the One] who speaks in righteousness [proclaiming vindication], mighty to save." 















###### 2 







Why is Your apparel red, And Your garments like the one who treads in the wine press? 















###### 3 







"I have trodden the wine trough alone, And of the peoples there was no one with Me. I also trod them in My anger And trampled them in My wrath; And their lifeblood is sprinkled on My garments, And I stained all My clothes. 















###### 4 







"For the day of vengeance [against ungodliness] was in My heart, And My year of redemption [of those who put their trust in Me--the year of My redeemed] has come. 















###### 5 







"I looked, but there was no one to help, And I was amazed _and_ appalled that there was no one to uphold [truth and right]. So My own arm brought salvation to Me, And My wrath sustained Me. 















###### 6 







"I trampled the peoples in My anger And made them drunk with [the cup of] My wrath, And I spilled their lifeblood on the earth." ## God's Ancient Mercies Recalled 















###### 7 







I will tell of the lovingkindnesses of the LORD, and the praiseworthy deeds of the LORD, According to all that the LORD has done for us, And _His_ great goodness toward the house of Israel, Which He has shown them according to His compassion And according to the abundance of His lovingkindnesses. 















###### 8 







For He said, "Be assured, they are My people, Sons who will not be faithless." So He became their Savior [in all their distresses]. 















###### 9 







In all their distress He was distressed, And the [^a]angel of His presence saved them, In His love and in His compassion He redeemed them; And He lifted them up and carried them all the days of old. 















###### 10 







But they rebelled And grieved His Holy Spirit; Therefore He changed into their enemy, And He fought against them. 















###### 11 







Then His people remembered the days of old, of Moses [and they said], Where is He who brought our fathers up out of the [Red] Sea, with the shepherds of His flock [Moses and Aaron]? Where is He who put His Holy Spirit in their midst, 















###### 12 







Who caused His glorious arm _and_ infinite power to go at the right hand of Moses, Dividing the waters before them to make for Himself an everlasting name, 















###### 13 







Who led them through the depths [of the Red Sea], Like a horse in the wilderness, [so that] they did not stumble? 















###### 14 







Like the cattle that go down into the valley [to find better pasture and rest], The Spirit of the LORD gave them rest. So You led Your people [O LORD] To make for Yourself a beautiful _and_ glorious name [preparing the way for the acknowledgment of Your name by all nations]. ## "You Are Our Father" 















###### 15 







Look down from heaven and see from Your lofty dwelling place, holy and glorious. Where are Your zeal and Your mighty acts [Your miracles which you did for Your people]? The stirring of Your heart and Your compassion are restrained _and_ withheld from me. 















###### 16 







For [most certainly] You are our Father, even though Abraham [our ancestor] does not know us And Israel does not acknowledge us. You, O LORD, are [still] our Father, Our Redeemer from everlasting is Your name. 















###### 17 







O LORD, why do You cause us to stray from Your ways And harden our heart from fearing You [with reverence and awe]? Return for Your servants' sake, the tribes of Your heritage. 















###### 18 







Your holy people possessed Your sanctuary for [only] a little while; Our adversaries have trampled it down. 















###### 19 







We have become _like_ those over whom You have never ruled, _Like_ those who were not called by Your name. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

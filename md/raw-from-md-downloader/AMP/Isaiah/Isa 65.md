# Isaiah 65

***
















###### 1 







"I let Myself be sought by those who did not ask _for Me_; I let Myself be found by those who did not seek Me. I said, 'Here am I, here am I,' To the nation [Israel] which did not call on My Name. 















###### 2 







"I have spread out My hands all the day long to a rebellious _and_ stubborn people, Who walk in the way that is not good, [following] after their own thoughts _and_ intentions, 















###### 3 







The people who continually provoke Me to My face, Sacrificing [to idols] in gardens and making offerings with incense on bricks [instead of at the designated altar]; 















###### 4 







Who sit among the graves [trying to conjure up evil spirits] and spend the night in the secret places [where spirits are thought to dwell]; Who eat swine's flesh, And their pots _hold_ the broth of [^a]unclean meat; 















###### 5 







Who say, 'Keep to yourself, do not come near me, For I [^b]am too holy for you [and you might defile me]!' These [people] are smoke in My nostrils, A fire that burns all the day. 















###### 6 







"Indeed, it is written before Me, I will not keep silent, but I will repay; I will even repay it [directly] into their [^c]arms, 















###### 7 







Both your own wickedness and the wickedness of your fathers," says the LORD. "Since they _too_ have made offerings with incense on the mountains And scorned _and_ taunted Me on the hills, I therefore will measure [punishment for] their former work [directly] into their [^d]arms." 















###### 8 







This is what the LORD says, "As the new wine is found in the cluster, And one says, 'Do not destroy it, for there is a blessing _and_ benefit in it,' So I will do for the sake of My servants In order not to destroy all of them. 















###### 9 







"I will bring forth descendants from Jacob, And an heir of My mountains from Judah; Even My chosen ones shall inherit it, And My servants will live there. 















###### 10 







"And [the plain of] Sharon will be a place for flocks to graze, And the Valley of Achor a resting place for herds, For My people who seek Me [who long for Me and require My presence in their lives]. 















###### 11 







"But you who abandon (turn away from) the LORD, Who forget _and_ ignore My holy mountain (Zion), Who set a table for Gad [the Babylonian god of fortune], And who fill a jug of mixed wine for Meni [the god of fate], 















###### 12 







I will destine you for the sword, [says the LORD], And all of you will bow down to the slaughter, Because when I called, you did not answer; When I spoke, you did not listen _or_ obey. But you did [what was] evil in My sight And chose that in which I did not delight." 















###### 13 







Therefore, the Lord God says this, "Listen carefully, My servants will eat, but you will be hungry; Indeed, My servants will drink, but you will be thirsty; Indeed, My servants will rejoice, but you will be put to shame. 















###### 14 







"Indeed, My servants will shout for joy from a happy heart, But you will cry out with a heavy heart, And you shall wail _and_ howl from a broken spirit. 















###### 15 







"And you will leave your name behind to My chosen ones [who will use it] as a curse, And the Lord God will put you to death, But He will call His servants by another name [a much greater name, just as the name Israel was greater than the name Jacob]. 















###### 16 







"Because he who blesses himself on the earth Will bless himself by the God of truth _and_ faithfulness; And he who swears [an oath] on the earth Will swear by the God of truth _and_ faithfulness; Because the former troubles are forgotten, And because they are hidden from My sight. ## New Heavens and a New Earth 















###### 17 







"Behold, I am creating new heavens and a new earth; And the former things [of life] will not be remembered or come to mind. 















###### 18 







"But be glad and rejoice forever over what I create; Behold, I am creating Jerusalem to be a _source of_ rejoicing And her people a joy. 















###### 19 







"I will also rejoice in Jerusalem and be glad in My people; And there will no longer be heard in her The voice of weeping and the sound of crying. 















###### 20 







"No longer shall there be [^e]in it an infant _who lives only a few_ days, Or an old man who does not finish his days; For the youth who dies at the age of a hundred, And the one who does not reach the age of a hundred Will be _thought of as_ accursed. 















###### 21 







"They will build houses and live _in them_; They will plant vineyards and eat the fruit. 















###### 22 







"They will not build and another occupy; They will not plant and another eat [the fruit]. For as the lifetime of a tree, _so will be_ the days of My people, And My chosen [people] will fully enjoy [and long make use of] the work of their hands. 















###### 23 







"They will not labor in vain, Or bear _children_ for disaster; For they are the descendants of those blessed by the LORD, And their offspring with them. 















###### 24 







"It shall also come to pass that before they call, I will answer; and while they are still speaking, I will hear. 















###### 25 







The wolf and the lamb will graze together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox [there will no longer be predator and prey]; and dust will be the serpent's food. They will do no evil or harm in all My holy mountain (Zion)," says the LORD. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

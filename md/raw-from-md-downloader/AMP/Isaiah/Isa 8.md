# Isaiah 8

***
















###### 1 







Then the LORD said to me, "Take for yourself a large tablet [for public display] and write on it in ordinary characters: _Belonging_ to [^a]Maher-shalal-hash-baz. 















###### 2 







And I will get faithful witnesses to attest [to this prophecy] for me, Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah." 















###### 3 







So I approached [my wife] the prophetess, and she conceived and gave birth to a son. Then the LORD said to me, "Name him Maher-shalal-hash-baz [to remind the people of the prophecy]; 















###### 4 







for before the boy knows how to say, 'My father' or 'My mother,' the riches of Damascus (Aram's capital) and the spoil of Samaria (Israel's capital) [^b]will be carried away by the king of Assyria." 















###### 5 







Again the LORD spoke to me, saying, 















###### 6 







"Because these people (Judah) have refused the gently flowing waters of [^c]Shiloah And rejoice in Rezin [the king of Aram] and Remaliah's son [Pekah the king of Israel], 















###### 7 







Now therefore, listen carefully, the Lord is about to bring on them the waters of the [Euphrates] River, strong and abundant-- The king of Assyria and all his glory; And it will rise over all its channels _and_ canals and go far beyond its banks. 















###### 8 







"Then it will [^d]sweep on into Judah; it will overflow and pass through [the hills], Reaching even to the neck [of which Jerusalem is the head], And its outstretched wings (the armies of Assyria) will fill the width of Your land, O Immanuel. ## A Believing Remnant 















###### 9 







"Be broken [in pieces], O peoples, and be shattered! Listen, all you [our enemies from the] far countries. Prepare yourselves [for war], and be shattered; Prepare yourselves [for war], and be shattered. 















###### 10 







"Take counsel together [against Judah], but it will come to nothing; Speak the word, but it will not stand, For God is with us (Immanuel)." 















###### 11 







For in this way the LORD spoke to me with His strong hand [upon me] and instructed me not to walk in the way of this people [behaving as they do], saying, 















###### 12 







"You are not to say, 'It is a conspiracy!' In regard to all that this people call a conspiracy, And you are not to fear what they fear nor be in dread of it. 















###### 13 







"It is the LORD of hosts whom you are to regard as holy _and_ awesome. He shall be your [source of] fear, He shall be your [source of] dread [not man]. 















###### 14 







"Then He shall be a sanctuary [a sacred, indestructible shelter for those who fear and trust Him]; But to both the houses of Israel [both the northern and southern kingdoms--Israel and Judah, He will be] a stone on which to stumble and a rock on which to trip, A trap and a snare for the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 















###### 15 







"Many [among them] will stumble over them; Then they will fall and be broken, They will even be snared and trapped." 















###### 16 







Bind up the testimony, seal the law _and_ the teaching among my (Isaiah's) disciples. 















###### 17 







And I will wait for the LORD who is hiding His face from the house of Jacob; and I will look eagerly for Him. 















###### 18 







Listen carefully, I and the children whom the LORD has given me are [^e]for signs and wonders [that will occur] in Israel from the LORD of hosts, who dwells on Mount Zion. 















###### 19 







When the people [instead of trusting God] say to you, "Consult the mediums [who try to talk to the dead] and the soothsayers who chirp _and_ whisper and mutter," should not a people consult their God? _Should they consult_ the dead on behalf of the living? 















###### 20 







[Direct those people] to the law and to the testimony! If their teachings are not in accord with this word, it is because they have no dawn. 















###### 21 







They [who consult mediums and soothsayers] will pass through the land deeply distressed and hungry, and when they are hungry, they will become enraged and will curse their king and their God as they look upward. 















###### 22 







Then they will look to the earth, they will see only distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish; and _they will be_ driven away into darkness _and_ overwhelming night. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: Isaiah 8:4 Samaria was overthrown by Assyria in 722 b.c., ten years after the downfall of Damascus, fulfilling this prophecy. [^c]: Isaiah 8:6 The perennial spring outside Jerusalem that flowed to the Pool of Siloam, Jerusalem’s water supply. The spring was a symbol of God’s protection and sustaining power. [^d]: Isaiah 8:8 This prophecy was literally fulfilled, and although Aram and Israel were conquered and led into captivity, the kingdom of Judah was spared and continued for over 130 years. [^e]: Isaiah 8:18 Isaiah’s own name means “Salvation of the Lord.” His two children’s names were “signs” as well, the one (see note v 1) pointing to the coming military crisis and the other (see note 7:3) to the future restoration.

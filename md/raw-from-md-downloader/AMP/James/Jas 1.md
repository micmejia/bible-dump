# James 1

***
















###### 1 







[^a]James, a bond-servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, To the twelve [Hebrew] tribes [scattered abroad among the Gentiles] in the dispersion: Greetings (rejoice)! 















###### 2 







Consider it nothing but joy, my [^b]brothers and sisters, whenever you fall into various trials. 















###### 3 







Be assured that the testing of your faith [through experience] produces endurance [leading to spiritual maturity, and inner peace]. 















###### 4 







And let endurance have its perfect result _and_ do a thorough work, so that you may be perfect and completely developed [in your faith], lacking in nothing. 















###### 5 







If any of you lacks wisdom [to guide him through a decision or circumstance], he is to ask of [our benevolent] God, who gives to everyone generously and without rebuke _or_ blame, and it will be given to him. 















###### 6 







But he must ask [for wisdom] in faith, without doubting [God's willingness to help], for the one who doubts is like a billowing surge of the sea that is blown about and tossed by the wind. 















###### 7 







For such a person ought not to think _or_ expect that he will receive anything [at all] from the Lord, 















###### 8 







_being_ a double-minded man, unstable _and_ restless in all his ways [in everything he thinks, feels, or decides]. 















###### 9 







Let the brother in humble circumstances glory in his high position [as a born-again believer, called to the true riches and to be an heir of God]; 















###### 10 







and the rich man _is to glory_ in being humbled [by trials revealing human frailty, knowing true riches are found in the grace of God], for like the flower of the grass he will pass away. 















###### 11 







For the sun rises with a scorching wind and withers the grass; its flower falls off and [^c]its beauty fades away; so too will the rich man, in the midst of his pursuits, fade away. 















###### 12 







Blessed [happy, spiritually prosperous, favored by God] is the man who is steadfast under trial _and_ perseveres when tempted; for when he has passed the test _and_ been approved, he will receive the [victor's] crown of life which _the Lord_ has promised to those who love Him. 















###### 13 







Let no one say when he is tempted, "I am being tempted by God" [for temptation does not originate from God, but from our own flaws]; for God cannot be tempted by [what is] evil, and He Himself tempts no one. 















###### 14 







But each one is tempted when he is dragged away, enticed _and_ baited [to commit sin] by his own [worldly] desire (lust, passion). 















###### 15 







Then when the illicit desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and when sin has run its course, it gives birth to death. 















###### 16 







Do not be misled, my beloved brothers and sisters. 















###### 17 







Every good thing given and every perfect gift is from above; it comes down from the Father of lights [the Creator and Sustainer of the heavens], in whom there is no variation [no rising or setting] or shadow [^d]cast by His turning [for He is perfect and never changes]. 















###### 18 







It was of His own will that He gave us birth [as His children] by the word of truth, so that we would be a kind of first fruits of His creatures [a prime example of what He created to be set apart to Himself--sanctified, made holy for His divine purposes]. 















###### 19 







Understand this, my beloved brothers and sisters. Let everyone be quick to hear [be a careful, thoughtful listener], slow to speak [a speaker of carefully chosen words and], slow to anger [patient, reflective, forgiving]; 















###### 20 







for the [resentful, deep-seated] anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God [that standard of behavior which He requires from us]. 















###### 21 







So get rid of all uncleanness and [^e]all that remains of wickedness, and with a humble spirit receive the word [of God] which is implanted [actually rooted in your heart], which is able to save your souls. 















###### 22 







But prove yourselves doers of the word [actively and continually obeying God's precepts], and not merely listeners [who hear the word but fail to internalize its meaning], deluding yourselves [by unsound reasoning contrary to the truth]. 















###### 23 







For if anyone only listens to the word [^f]without obeying it, he is like a man who looks very carefully at his natural face in a mirror; 















###### 24 







for _once_ he has looked at himself and gone away, he immediately forgets [^g]what he looked like. 















###### 25 







But he who looks carefully into the perfect law, the _law_ of liberty, and faithfully abides by it, not having become a [careless] listener who forgets but [^h]an active doer [who obeys], he will be blessed _and_ favored by God in what he does [in his life of obedience]. 















###### 26 







If anyone thinks himself to be religious [scrupulously observant of the rituals of his faith], and does not control his tongue but deludes his _own_ heart, this person's religion is worthless (futile, barren). 















###### 27 







Pure and unblemished religion [as it is expressed in outward acts] in the sight of our God and Father is this: to visit _and_ look after the fatherless and the widows in their distress, and to keep oneself uncontaminated by the [secular] world. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

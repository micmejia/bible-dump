# James 2

***
















###### 1 







My fellow believers, do not practice your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ with _an attitude_ of partiality [toward people--show no favoritism, no prejudice, no snobbery]. 















###### 2 







For if a man comes into your [^a]meeting place [^b]wearing a gold ring and [^c]fine clothes, and a poor man in dirty clothes also comes in, 















###### 3 







and you pay special attention to the one who wears the [^d]fine clothes, and say to him, "You sit here in this good seat," and you tell the poor man, "You stand over there, or sit down [on the floor] by my footstool," 















###### 4 







have you not discriminated among yourselves, and become judges with wrong motives? 















###### 5 







Listen, my beloved brothers and sisters: has not God chosen the poor of this world to be rich in faith and [as believers to be] heirs of the kingdom which He promised to those who love Him? 















###### 6 







But you [in contrast] have dishonored the poor man. Is it not the rich who oppress _and_ exploit you, and personally drag you into the courts of law? 















###### 7 







Do they not blaspheme the [^e]precious name [of Christ] by which you are called? 















###### 8 







If, however, you are [really] fulfilling the royal law according to the Scripture, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself [that is, if you have an unselfish concern for others and do things for their benefit]" you are doing well. 















###### 9 







But if you show partiality [prejudice, favoritism], you are committing sin and are convicted by the Law as offenders. 















###### 10 







For whoever keeps the whole Law but stumbles in one _point_, he has become guilty of [breaking] all of it. 















###### 11 







For He who said, "Do not commit adultery," also said, "Do not murder." Now if you do not commit adultery, but you murder, you have become [^f]guilty of transgressing the [entire] Law. 















###### 12 







Speak and act [consistently] as people who are going to be judged by the law of liberty [that moral law that frees obedient Christians from the bondage of sin]. 















###### 13 







For judgment _will be_ merciless to one who has shown no mercy; but [to the one who has shown mercy] mercy triumphs [victoriously] over judgment. ## Faith and Works 















###### 14 







What is the benefit, my fellow believers, if someone claims to have faith but has no [good] works [as evidence]? Can that [kind of] faith save him? [No, a mere claim of faith is not sufficient--genuine faith produces good works.] 















###### 15 







If a brother or sister is without [adequate] clothing and lacks [enough] food for each day, 















###### 16 







and one of you says to them, "Go in peace [with my blessing], [keep] warm and feed yourselves," but he does not give them the necessities for the body, what good does that do? 















###### 17 







So too, faith, if it does not have works [to back it up], is by itself dead [inoperative and ineffective]. 















###### 18 







But someone may say, "You [claim to] have faith and I have [good] works; show me your [alleged] faith without the works [if you can], and I will show you my faith by my works [that is, by what I do]." 















###### 19 







You believe that [^g]God is one; you do well [to believe that]. The demons also believe [that], and shudder _and_ bristle [in awe-filled terror--they have seen His wrath]! 















###### 20 







But are you willing to recognize, you foolish [spiritually shallow] person, that faith without [good] works is useless? 















###### 21 







Was our father Abraham not [shown to be] justified by works [of obedience which expressed his faith] when he offered Isaac his son on the altar [as a sacrifice to God]? 















###### 22 







You see that [his] faith was working together with his works, and as a result of the works, his faith was completed [reaching its maturity when he expressed his faith through obedience]. 















###### 23 







And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, "Abraham believed God, and this [faith] was credited to him [by God] as righteousness _and_ as conformity to His will," and he was called the friend of God. 















###### 24 







You see that a man (believer) is justified by works and not by faith alone [that is, by acts of obedience a born-again believer reveals his faith]. 















###### 25 







In the same way, was Rahab the prostitute not justified by works too, when she received the [Hebrew] [^h]spies as guests _and_ protected them, and sent them away [to escape] by a different route? 















###### 26 







For just as the [human] body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works [of obedience] is also dead. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# James 3

***
















###### 1 







Not many [of you] should become teachers [serving in an official teaching capacity], my brothers and sisters, for you know that we [who are teachers] will [^a]be judged by a higher standard [because we have assumed greater accountability and more condemnation if we teach incorrectly]. 















###### 2 







For we all stumble _and_ sin in many _ways_. If anyone does not stumble in what he says [never saying the wrong thing], he is a perfect man [fully developed in character, without serious flaws], able to bridle his whole body _and_ rein in his entire nature [taming his human faults and weaknesses]. 















###### 3 







Now if we put bits into the horses' mouths to make them obey us, we guide their whole body as well. 















###### 4 







And look at the ships. Even though they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are still directed by a very small rudder wherever the impulse of the helmsman determines. 















###### 5 







In the same sense, the tongue is a small part of the body, and yet it boasts of great things. See [by comparison] how great a forest is set on fire by a small spark! 















###### 6 







And the tongue is [in a sense] a fire, the _very_ world of injustice _and_ unrighteousness; the tongue is set among our members as that which contaminates the entire body, and sets on fire the course of our life [the cycle of man's existence], and is itself set on fire by [^b]hell (Gehenna). 















###### 7 







For every species of beasts and birds, of reptiles and sea creatures, is tamed and has been tamed by the human race. 















###### 8 







But no one can tame the _human_ tongue; it is a restless evil [undisciplined, unstable], full of deadly poison. 















###### 9 







With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in the likeness of God. 















###### 10 







Out of the same mouth come _both_ blessing and cursing. These things, my brothers, should not be this way [for we have a moral obligation to speak in a manner that reflects our fear of God and profound respect for His precepts]. 















###### 11 







Does a spring send out from the same opening _both_ [^c]fresh and bitter _water_? 















###### 12 







Can a fig tree, my brothers, produce olives, or a grapevine produce figs? Nor can salt water produce [^d]fresh. ## Wisdom from Above 















###### 13 







Who among you is wise and intelligent? Let him by his good conduct show his [good] deeds with the gentleness _and_ humility of _true_ wisdom. 















###### 14 







But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not be arrogant, and [as a result] be in defiance of the truth. 















###### 15 







This [superficial] wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly (secular), natural (unspiritual), _even_ demonic. 















###### 16 







For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder [unrest, rebellion] and every evil thing _and_ morally degrading practice. 















###### 17 







But the wisdom from above is first pure [morally and spiritually undefiled], then peace-loving [courteous, considerate], gentle, reasonable [and willing to listen], full of compassion and good fruits. It is unwavering, without [self-righteous] hypocrisy [and self-serving guile]. 















###### 18 







And the seed whose fruit is righteousness (spiritual maturity) is sown in peace by those who make peace [by actively encouraging goodwill between individuals]. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# James 4

***
















###### 1 







What leads to [the unending] [^a]quarrels and conflicts among you? Do they not come from your [hedonistic] desires that wage war in your [bodily] members [fighting for control over you]? 















###### 2 







You are jealous _and_ covet [what others have] and [^b]your lust goes unfulfilled; so you [^c]murder. You are envious and cannot obtain [the object of your envy]; so you fight and battle. You do not have because you do not ask [it of God]. 















###### 3 







You ask [God for something] and do not receive it, because you ask [^d]with wrong motives [out of selfishness or with an unrighteous agenda], so that [when you get what you want] you may spend it on your [hedonistic] desires. 















###### 4 







You adulteresses [disloyal sinners--flirting with the world and breaking your vow to God]! Do you not know that being the world's friend [that is, loving the things of the world] is being God's enemy? So whoever chooses to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God. 















###### 5 







Or do you think that the Scripture says to no purpose [^e]that the [human] spirit which He has made to dwell in us lusts with envy? 















###### 6 







But He gives us more and more grace [through the power of the Holy Spirit to defy sin and live an obedient life that reflects both our faith and our gratitude for our salvation]. Therefore, it says, "God is opposed to the proud _and_ haughty, but [continually] gives [the gift of] grace to the humble [who turn away from self-righteousness]." 















###### 7 







So submit to [the authority of] God. Resist the devil [stand firm against him] and he will flee from you. 















###### 8 







Come close to God [with a contrite heart] and He will come close to you. Wash your hands, you sinners; and purify your [unfaithful] hearts, you double-minded [people]. 















###### 9 







Be miserable and grieve and weep [over your sin]. Let your [foolish] laughter be turned to mourning and your [reckless] joy to gloom. 















###### 10 







Humble yourselves [with an attitude of repentance and insignificance] in the presence of the Lord, and He will exalt you [He will lift you up, He will give you purpose]. 















###### 11 







Believers, do not speak against _or_ slander one another. He who speaks [self-righteously] against a brother or [^f]judges his brother [hypocritically], speaks against the Law and judges the Law. If you judge the Law, you are not a doer of the Law but a judge of it. 















###### 12 







There is _only_ one Lawgiver and Judge, the One who is able to save and to destroy [the one God who has the absolute power of life and death]; but who are you to [hypocritically or self-righteously] pass judgment on your neighbor? 















###### 13 







Come now [and pay attention to this], you who say, "Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a city, and spend a year there and carry on our business and make a profit." 















###### 14 







[^g]Yet you do not know [the least thing] [^h]about what may happen in your life tomorrow. [What is secure in your life?] You are _merely_ a vapor [like a puff of smoke or a wisp of steam from a cooking pot] that is visible for a little while and then vanishes [into thin air]. 















###### 15 







Instead [^i]you ought to say, "If the Lord wills, we will live and we will do this or that." 















###### 16 







But as it is, you boast [vainly] in your pretension _and_ arrogance. All such boasting is evil. 















###### 17 







So any person who knows what is right to do but does not do it, to him it is sin. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: James 4:2 Lit _you do not have_. [^c]: James 4:2 Possibly a reference to Christ’s statement in Matt 5:22, or to actually doing something that results in someone’s death in order to take what he has. [^d]: James 4:3 Lit _wrongly_. [^e]: James 4:5 This verse is difficult to translate, and it seems that James is paraphrasing or generalizing a scriptural concept rather than quoting directly from the Old Testament. [^f]: James 4:11 This is not a prohibition of all judgment, nor is it a command to stop using godly wisdom, common sense, and moral courage together with God’s written word to discern right from wrong, to distinguish between morality and immorality, and to judge doctrinal truth. There are many judgments that are not only legitimate, but are commanded (cf John 7:24; 1 Cor 5:5, 12; Gal 1:8, 9; 1 John 4:1-3; 2 John 10); however, you cannot judge another if you are committing the same type of sin. [^g]: James 4:14 Lit _Who do not_. [^h]: James 4:14 Lit _what sort your life will be_. [^i]: James 4:15 Lit _of your saying_.

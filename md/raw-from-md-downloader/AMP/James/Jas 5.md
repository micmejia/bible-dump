# James 5

***
















###### 1 







Come [quickly] now, you rich [who lack true faith and hoard and misuse your resources], weep and howl over the miseries [the woes, the judgments] that are coming upon you. 















###### 2 







Your wealth has rotted _and_ is ruined and your [fine] clothes have become moth-eaten. 















###### 3 







Your gold and silver are corroded, and their corrosion will be a witness against you and will consume your flesh like fire. You have stored up your treasure in the last days [when it will do you no good]. 















###### 4 







Look! The wages that you have [fraudulently] withheld from the laborers who have mowed your fields are crying out [against you for vengeance]; and the cries of the harvesters have come to the ears of [^a]the Lord of Sabaoth. 















###### 5 







On the earth you have lived luxuriously _and_ abandoned yourselves to soft living and led a life of wanton pleasure [self-indulgence, self-gratification]; you have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter. 















###### 6 







You have condemned and have put to death the righteous _man_; he offers you no resistance. ## Exhortation 















###### 7 







So wait patiently, brothers and sisters, until the coming of the Lord. The farmer waits [expectantly] for the precious harvest from the land, being patient about it, until it receives the early and late rains. 















###### 8 







You too, be patient; strengthen your hearts [keep them energized and firmly committed to God], because the coming of the Lord is near. 















###### 9 







Do not complain against one another, believers, so that you will not be judged [for it]. Look! The Judge is standing [^b]right at the door. 















###### 10 







As an example, brothers and sisters, of suffering and patience, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord [as His messengers and representatives]. 















###### 11 







You know we call those blessed [happy, spiritually prosperous, favored by God] who were steadfast _and_ endured [difficult circumstances]. You have heard of the _patient_ endurance of Job and you have seen the Lord's outcome [how He richly blessed Job]. The Lord is full of compassion and is merciful. 















###### 12 







But above all, my fellow believers, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or with any other oath; but let your yes be [a truthful] yes, and your no be [a truthful] no, so that you may not fall under judgment. 















###### 13 







Is anyone among you suffering? He must pray. Is anyone joyful? He is to sing praises [to God]. 















###### 14 







Is anyone among you sick? He must call for the elders (spiritual leaders) of the church and they are to pray over him, anointing him with [^c]oil in the name of the Lord; 















###### 15 







and the prayer of faith will restore the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven. 















###### 16 







Therefore, confess your sins to one another [your false steps, your offenses], and pray for one another, that you may be healed _and_ restored. The heartfelt _and_ persistent prayer of a righteous man (believer) can accomplish much [when put into action and made effective by God--it is dynamic and can have tremendous power]. 















###### 17 







Elijah was a man with a nature like ours [with the same physical, mental, and spiritual limitations and shortcomings], and he prayed [^d]intensely for it not to rain, and it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months. 















###### 18 







Then he prayed again, and the sky gave rain and the land produced its crops [as usual]. 















###### 19 







My brothers and sisters, if anyone among you strays from the truth _and_ falls into error and [another] one turns him back [to God], 















###### 20 







let the [latter] one know that the one who has turned a sinner from the error of his way will save that one's soul from death and cover a multitude of sins [that is, obtain the pardon of the many sins committed by the one who has been restored]. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

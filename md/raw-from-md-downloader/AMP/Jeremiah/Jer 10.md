# Jeremiah 10

***
















###### 1 







Hear the word which the LORD speaks to you, O house of Israel. 















###### 2 







Thus says the LORD, "Do not learn the way of the [pagan] nations, And do not be terrified _and_ distressed by the signs of the heavens Although the pagans are terrified by them; 















###### 3 







For the customs _and_ decrees of the peoples are [mere] delusion [exercises in futility]; It is only wood which one cuts from the forest [to make a god], The work of the hands of the craftsman with the axe _or_ cutting tool. 















###### 4 







"They adorn the idol with silver and with gold; They fasten it with hammers and nails So that it will not fall apart. 















###### 5 







"They are like scarecrows in a cucumber field; They cannot speak; They have to be carried, Because they cannot walk! Do not be afraid of them, For they can do no harm _or_ evil, Nor can they do any good." 















###### 6 







There is none like You, O LORD; You are great, and great is Your mighty _and_ powerful name. 















###### 7 







Who would not fear You, O King of the nations? For it is appropriate _and_ it is Your due! For among all the wise men of the nations And in all their kingdoms, There is none like You. 















###### 8 







But they are altogether irrational _and_ stupid and foolish _In their_ discipline of delusion--their idol is [only] wood [it is ridiculous, empty and worthless]! 















###### 9 







Silver _that has been_ beaten [into plates] is brought from [^a]Tarshish, And gold from [^b]Uphaz, The work of the craftsman and of the hand of the goldsmith; Violet and purple are their clothing; They are all the work of skilled men. 















###### 10 







But the LORD is the true God _and_ the God who is Truth; He is the living God and the everlasting King. The earth quakes _and_ shudders at His wrath, And the nations are not able to endure His indignation. 















###### 11 







In this manner you shall say to them, "The gods that did not make the heavens and the earth will perish from the earth and from under the heavens." 















###### 12 







God made the earth by His power; He established the world by His wisdom And by His understanding _and_ skill He has stretched out the heavens. 















###### 13 







When He utters His voice, _there is_ a tumult of [^c]waters in the heavens, And He causes the clouds _and_ the mist to ascend from the end of the earth; He makes lightning for the rain, And brings out the wind from His treasuries _and_ from His storehouses. 















###### 14 







Every man has become [like a brute] irrational _and_ stupid, without knowledge [of God]; Every goldsmith is shamed by his carved idols; For his molten images are frauds _and_ lies, And there is no breath in them. 















###### 15 







They are worthless _and_ devoid of promise, a work of delusion _and_ mockery; In their time of [trial and] punishment they will perish [without hope]. 















###### 16 







The Portion of Jacob [the true God on whom Israel has a claim] is not like these; For He is the Designer _and_ Maker of all things, And Israel is the tribe of His inheritance [and He will not fail them]-- The LORD of hosts is His name. 















###### 17 







Gather up your bundle [of goods] from the ground, You who live under siege. 















###### 18 







For thus says the LORD; "Behold, I am slinging out at this time the people of this land, And will cause them [great] distress, That they may find it [to be as I have said]." 















###### 19 







"Woe to me because of my [spiritual] brokenness!" [says Jeremiah, speaking for the nation.] "My wound is incurable." But I said, "Surely this sickness _and_ suffering _and_ grief are mine, And I must bear it." 















###### 20 







My tent is destroyed, And all my [tent] cords are broken; My children have been taken from me [as captives] and are no more. There is no one to stretch out my tent again And to set up my [tent] curtains. 















###### 21 







For the shepherds [of the people] have become [like brutes,] irrational _and_ stupid, And have not searched for the LORD _or_ asked about Him _or_ realized their need for Him; Therefore they have not been wise _and_ have not prospered, And all their flocks are scattered. 















###### 22 







The sound of a report! Behold, [the invader] comes-- A great commotion from the country of the north (Babylonia)-- To make the cities of Judah A desolation, a haunt _and_ dwelling place of jackals. 















###### 23 







O LORD, I know that the path of [life of] a man is not in himself; It is not within [the limited ability of] man [even one at his best] to choose _and_ direct his steps [in life]. 















###### 24 







O LORD, correct me [along with Your people], but with mercy _and_ in just measure-- Not in Your anger, or You will crush me _and_ bring me to nothing. 















###### 25 







Pour out Your wrath on the nations that do not know _nor_ recognize You And on the families that do not call Your name. For they have devoured Jacob; They have devoured him and consumed him And made his land a desolate waste. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Jeremiah 12

***
















###### 1 







You, O LORD are [uncompromisingly] righteous _and_ consistently just when I plead my case with You; Yet let me discuss issues of justice with You: Why has the way of the wicked prospered? Why are those who deal in treachery (deceit) at ease _and_ thriving? 















###### 2 







You have planted them, they have also taken root; They grow, they have even produced fruit. You are [^a]honored by their [hypocritical] lips But [You are] far from their heart _and_ mind. 















###### 3 







But You, O LORD, know me [and understand my devotion to You]; You see me; And You examine _the attitude of_ my heart toward You. Drag out the faithless like sheep for the slaughter [O LORD] And set them apart for the day of slaughter. 















###### 4 







How long must the land mourn And the grass of the countryside wither? Because of the wickedness _and_ hypocrisy of those who live in it, The beasts and the birds are consumed _and_ are swept away [by the drought], Because men [mocking me] have said, "He will not [live long enough to] see [what happens at] our final end." 















###### 5 







[The LORD rebukes Jeremiah for his impatience, saying] "If you have raced with men on foot and they have tired you out, Then how can you compete with horses? If you fall down in a land of peace [where you feel secure], Then how will you do [among the lions] in the [flooded] thicket beside the Jordan? 















###### 6 







"For even your [tribal] brothers and the household of your father, Even they have dealt treacherously (unfaithfully) with you; Indeed they are [like a pack of hounds] howling after you. Do not believe them, although they may say kind words _and_ promise you good things." ## God's Answer 















###### 7 







"I have abandoned My house, I have given up My [precious] inheritance (Judah); I have given the [dearly] beloved of My life Into the hands of her enemies. 















###### 8 







"My inheritance has become to Me Like a lion in the forest; She has raised her voice _and_ roared against Me; So I have come to [treat her as if I] hate her. 















###### 9 







"Is My inheritance like a speckled bird of prey to Me [unlike the others]? Are the birds of prey (enemies) surrounding her on every side? Go, gather all the [wild] beasts of the field; Bring them to devour [her]! 















###### 10 







"Many shepherds (invaders) have destroyed My vineyard (Judah), They have trampled My field underfoot; They have made My pleasant field A desolate wilderness. 















###### 11 







"They have made it a wasteland, Desolate, it mourns before Me; The whole land has been made a wasteland, Because no man takes it to heart. 















###### 12 







"Destroyers have come On all the caravan roads in the desert, For the sword of the LORD (Babylon) is devouring From one end of the land even to the other; No one has peace _or_ a way of escape. 















###### 13 







"They have planted wheat but have reaped thorns; They have exhausted themselves but without profit. So be ashamed of your harvest Because of the fierce _and_ raging anger of the LORD." 















###### 14 







Thus says the LORD regarding all My evil neighbors (Gentile nations) who strike at the inheritance which I have granted to My people Israel, "Behold, I will uproot them from their land and I will uproot the house of Judah from among them. 















###### 15 







And it shall come about that after I have uprooted them, I will return _and_ have compassion on them; and I will bring them back again, each one to his inheritance and each one to his land. 















###### 16 







And if these [neighboring nations] will diligently learn the ways of My people, to swear by My Name, saying, 'As the LORD lives'--even as they taught My people to swear by Baal, then they will be built up among My people. 















###### 17 







But if [any nation] will not listen _and_ obey, I will [completely] uproot and destroy that nation, says the LORD." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

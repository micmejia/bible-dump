# Jeremiah 13

***
















###### 1 







Thus the LORD said to me, "Go and buy yourself a linen waistband and put it on your [^a]loins, but do not put it in water." 















###### 2 







So I bought the waistband according to the word of the LORD and put it on my loins. 















###### 3 







Then the word of the LORD came to me a second time, saying, 















###### 4 







"Get up and take the waistband that you have bought, which is [wrapped] around your loins, and go to the [river] Euphrates and hide it there in a crevice of the rock." 















###### 5 







So I went and hid it by the Euphrates, as the LORD had commanded me. 















###### 6 







And after many days the LORD said to me, "Get up, go to the Euphrates and get the waistband which I commanded you to hide there." 















###### 7 







Then I went to the Euphrates and dug, and I took the waistband from the place where I had hidden it. And behold, the waistband was decayed _and_ ruined; it was completely worthless. 















###### 8 







Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 















###### 9 







"Thus says the LORD, 'In this same way I shall destroy the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem. 















###### 10 







These wicked _and_ malevolent people, who refuse to listen to My words, who walk in the stubborn way of their heart and have followed other gods [which are nothing--just man-made carvings] to serve them and to worship them, let them be just like this waistband which is completely worthless. 















###### 11 







For as the waistband clings to the body of a man, so I caused the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah to cling to Me,' says the LORD, 'that they might be for Me a people, a name, a praise, and a glory; but they did not listen _and_ obey.' ## Captivity Threatened 















###### 12 







"Therefore you are to speak this word to them, 'Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, "Every jar should be filled with wine."' The people will say to you, 'Do we not already know that every jar should be filled with wine?' 















###### 13 







Then say to them, 'Thus says the LORD, "Behold, I am about to fill with drunkenness all the people of this land, even the kings who sit on David's throne, the priests, the prophets and all the people of Jerusalem. 















###### 14 







I will smash them one against another, both the fathers and the sons together," says the LORD. "I shall destroy them [nothing will restrain Me]; I will not show pity nor be sorry nor have compassion."'" 















###### 15 







Listen and pay close attention, do not be haughty _and_ overconfident, For the LORD has spoken [says Jeremiah]. 















###### 16 







Give glory to the LORD your God, Before He brings darkness And before your feet stumble On the dark _and_ shadowy mountains, And while you are longing for light He turns it into the shadow of death, And makes it into thick darkness. 















###### 17 







But if you will not listen _and_ obey, My soul will weep in secret for your pride; My eyes will weep bitterly And flow with tears, Because the Lord's flock has been taken captive. 















###### 18 







Say to the king and the queen mother, "Humble yourselves _and_ take a lowly seat, For your beautiful crown [the crown of your glory] Has come down from your head." 















###### 19 







The cities of the South (the Negev) have been closed up, And there is no one to open them; All Judah has been carried into exile, Completely carried away into exile. 















###### 20 







"Lift up your eyes and see Those coming from the north. Where is the flock that was given to you [to shepherd], Your beautiful flock? 















###### 21 







"What will you say [O Jerusalem] when the LORD appoints [foreign nations to rule] over you-- Those former friends and allies whom you have encouraged [to be your companions]-- Will not pain seize you Like [that of] a woman in childbirth? 















###### 22 







"And if you [wonder and] say in your heart, 'Why have these things happened to me?' It is because of the greatness _and_ nature of your sin That your skirts have been [^b]pulled away [subjecting you to public disgrace] And [like a barefoot slave] your heels have been wounded. 















###### 23 







"Can the Ethiopian change his skin Or the leopard his spots? Then you also can do good Who are accustomed to evil _and_ even trained to do it. 















###### 24 







"Therefore I will scatter you like drifting straw [Driven away] by the desert wind. 















###### 25 







"This is your destiny, the portion [of judgment] measured to you From Me," says the LORD, "Because you have forgotten Me And trusted in [pagan] lies [the counterfeit gods, and the pretense of alliance]." 















###### 26 







"So I Myself will throw your skirts up over your face, That your shame may be exposed [publicly]. 















###### 27 







"I have seen your vile _and_ detestable acts, Even your adulteries and your _lustful_ neighings [after idols], And the lewdness of your prostitution On the hills in the fields. Woe (judgment is coming) to you, O Jerusalem! How long will you remain unclean [by ignoring My precepts]?" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Jeremiah 15

***
















###### 1 







Then the LORD said to me, "Even though Moses and Samuel were to stand before Me [interceding for them], My heart would still not be [turned with favor] toward this people [Judah]. Send them away from My presence _and_ out of My sight and let them go! 















###### 2 







And it shall be that when they say to you, 'Where should we go?' then tell them, 'Thus says the LORD: "Those [destined] for death, to death; Those for the sword, to the sword; Those for famine, to famine; Those for captivity, to captivity."' 















###### 3 







I will appoint four kinds of destroyers over them," says the LORD, "the sword to slay, the dogs to tear _and_ drag away, and the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth to devour and to destroy. 















###### 4 







I will make them an object of horror to all nations of the earth because of Manasseh [the despicable] son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, for the [evil and detestable] things which he did in Jerusalem. 















###### 5 







"For who will have pity on you, O Jerusalem, Or who will mourn for you, Or who will turn aside to ask about your welfare? 















###### 6 







"You have abandoned (rejected) Me," says the LORD. "You keep going backward. Therefore I shall stretch out My hand against you and destroy you; I am tired of delaying [your punishment]! 















###### 7 







"I will winnow (sort, separate) them with a winnowing fork At the gates of the land; I will deprive them of children, I will destroy My people; They did not repent _and_ turn from their [evil] ways. 















###### 8 







"I will make their widows more numerous before Me Than the sand of the seas; I will bring against them, against the mother of the young men, A [^a]destroyer at noonday; I will suddenly cause anguish and terror To fall on her. 















###### 9 







"She who has borne seven [sons] languishes; She has breathed out her soul. Her sun has set while it was still day; She has been shamed and humiliated. So I will hand over [the rest of] the survivors to the sword Before their enemies," says the LORD. 















###### 10 







Woe to me, my mother, that you have given birth to me To be a man of strife and a man of contention to all the earth! I have not loaned, nor have men lent money to me, Yet everyone curses me. 















###### 11 







The LORD said, "Surely [it will go well for Judah's obedient remnant for] I will set you free for good _purposes_; Surely [Jeremiah] I will [intercede for you with the enemy and I will] cause the enemy to plead with you [for help] In a time of disaster and a time of distress. 















###### 12 







"Can anyone crush iron, The iron from the north, or bronze? 















###### 13 







"Your [nation's] riches and your treasures I will give as plunder without price [to the Babylonians], Because of all your sins And within all your territories. 















###### 14 







"Then I will make your enemies bring [you along with] your possessions Into a land which you do not know [for there you will serve your conquerors]; For a fire has been kindled in My anger, Which will burn upon you." ## Jeremiah's Prayer and God's Answer 















###### 15 







O LORD, You know _and_ understand; Remember me [thoughtfully], take notice of me, take vengeance for me on my persecutors. Do not, in view of Your patience, take me away; Know that for Your sake I endure [continual] rebuke _and_ dishonor. 















###### 16 







Your words were found and I ate them, And Your words became a joy to me and the delight of my heart; For I have been called by Your name, O LORD God of hosts. 















###### 17 







I did not sit with the group of those who celebrate, Nor did I rejoice; I sat alone because Your [powerful] hand was _upon me_, For You had filled me with indignation [at their sin]. 















###### 18 







Why has my pain been perpetual And my wound incurable, refusing to be healed? Will you indeed be to me like a deceptive _brook_ With water that is unreliable? 















###### 19 







Therefore, thus says the LORD [to Jeremiah], "If you repent [and give up this mistaken attitude of despair and self-pity], then I will restore you [to a state of inner peace] So that you may stand before Me [as My obedient representative]; And if you separate the precious from the worthless [examining yourself and cleansing your heart from unwarranted doubt concerning My faithfulness], You will become My spokesman. Let the people turn to you [and learn to value My values]-- But you, you must not turn to them [with regard for their idolatry and wickedness]. 















###### 20 







"And I will make you to this people A fortified wall of bronze; They will fight against you, But they will not prevail over you, For I am with you [always] to save you And [^b]protect you," says the LORD. 















###### 21 







"So I will rescue you out of the hand of the wicked, And I will redeem you from the [grasping] palm of the terrible _and_ ruthless [tyrant]." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

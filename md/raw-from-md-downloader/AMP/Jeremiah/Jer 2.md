# Jeremiah 2

***
















###### 1 







Now the word of the LORD came to me saying, 















###### 2 







"Go and proclaim in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, 'Thus says the LORD, "I remember [earnestly] the lovingkindness _and_ devotion of [^a]your youth, Your time of betrothal [like that of a bride during the early years in Egypt and again at Sinai], When you followed Me in the wilderness, Through a land not sown. 















###### 3 







"[^b]Israel was holy [something set apart from ordinary purposes, consecrated] to the LORD, The first fruits of His harvest [in which no outsider was allowed to share]. All who ate of it [injuring Israel] became guilty; Evil came on them," says the LORD.'" 















###### 4 







Hear the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel. 















###### 5 







Thus says the LORD, "What injustice _or_ unrighteousness did your fathers find in Me, That they have wandered far from Me And [habitually] walked after emptiness _and_ futility and became empty? 















###### 6 







"They did not say, 'Where is the LORD Who brought us up from the land of Egypt, Who led us through the wilderness, Through a land of deserts and of pits, Through a land of drought and of the deep darkness [of the shadow of death], Through a land that no man passed through And where no man lived?' 















###### 7 







"I brought you into a plentiful land To eat its fruit and [enjoy] its good things. But you came and defiled My land And you made My inheritance repulsive. 















###### 8 







"[Even] the priests did not say, 'Where is the LORD?' And those who deal with the law [given to Moses] did not know Me. The rulers _and_ shepherds also transgressed against Me, And the prophets prophesied by [the authority and in the name of] Baal And walked after [idolatrous] things that did not benefit [them]. 















###### 9 







"Therefore I will still contend (struggle) with you [by bringing judgment on you]," says the LORD, "And I will contend with your children's children." 















###### 10 







"For cross over to the coasts of Kittim (Cyprus) [to the west] and see, Send also to Kedar (Arabia) [to the east] and carefully observe _and_ consider And see whether there has been such [a thing] as this! 















###### 11 







"Has a nation [ever] changed gods Even though they were not gods [but merely man-made objects]? But My people have exchanged their Glory (the true God) For that [man-made idol] which does not benefit [them]. 















###### 12 







"Be appalled, O heavens, at this; Be shocked _and_ shudder with horror [at the behavior of the people]," says the LORD. 















###### 13 







"For My people have committed two evils: They have abandoned (rejected) Me, The fountain of living water, And they have carved out their own cisterns, Broken cisterns That cannot hold water. 















###### 14 







"Is Israel a servant? Is he a slave by birth? Why has he become a captive _and_ a prey? 















###### 15 







"The young lions have roared at him, They have made their voices heard _and_ roared loudly. And they have made his land a waste; His cities have been destroyed and are burned ruins, without inhabitant. 















###### 16 







"Moreover, the men of [^c]Memphis and [^d]Tahpanhes [as powerful enemies] Have shaved the crown of your head [to degrade you]. 















###### 17 







"Have you not brought this on yourself By abandoning (rejecting) the LORD your God When He led you in the way? 















###### 18 







"Now what are you doing by going to Egypt [in search of an ally], To drink the [muddy] waters of the Nile? Or what are you doing by going to Assyria [in search of an ally], To drink the [muddy] waters of the Euphrates? 















###### 19 







"Your own wickedness will discipline you, And your desertion of the faith will punish you. Know therefore that it is an evil and bitter thing For you to abandon (reject) the LORD your God, And for you to be indifferent to Me _and_ dismiss the [reverent] fear of Me," says the Lord God of hosts. 















###### 20 







"For long ago you broke your yoke [in deliberate disobedience] And tore off your bonds [of the law that I gave you]; You said, 'I will not serve _and_ obey You!' For on every high hill And under every green tree You have lain down [in idolatrous worship] like a [compliant] prostitute. 















###### 21 







"Yet I had planted you [O house of Israel as] a choice vine, A completely faithful seed. How then have you turned against Me Into degenerate shoots of a foreign _and_ wild vine [alien to Me]? 















###### 22 







"For though you wash yourself with lye And use much soap, The stain of your guilt is [still] before Me [and you are soiled and dirty]," says the Lord God. 















###### 23 







"How can you say, 'I am not defiled, I have not gone after [man-made gods like] the Baals'? Look at your way in the valley; Know [without any doubt] what you have done! You are a swift _and_ restless young [female] camel [in the heat of her passion] running here and there, 















###### 24 







Or [you have the untamed and reckless nature of] a wild donkey accustomed to the wilderness, That sniffs the wind in her passion [for the scent of a mate]. In her mating season who can restrain her? No males seeking her need to weary themselves; In her month they will find her [looking for them]. 















###### 25 







"[Cease your mad running after idols to] Keep your feet from becoming bare And your throat from becoming dry; But you said, 'It is hopeless! For I have loved strangers _and_ foreign gods, And I will walk after them.' 















###### 26 







"As the thief is shamed when he is caught, So the house of Israel is shamed-- They, their kings, their leaders, Their priests, and their prophets-- 















###### 27 







Who say to a tree, 'You are my father,' And to a stone, 'You gave me birth.' For they have turned their backs to Me, And not their faces; But in the time of their trouble they will say, 'Arise [O LORD] and save us.' 















###### 28 







"But where are your gods Which you made for yourself? Let them get up, if they can save you In the time of your trouble! For [as many as] the number of your cities Are your gods, O Judah. [Why do not your many man-made idols run to help you?] 















###### 29 







"Why do you complain _and_ contend with Me? You have all rebelled (transgressed) against Me," says the LORD. 















###### 30 







"In vain I have punished your people [with the consequences of their disobedience]; They received no insight from correction [and refused to change]. Your [own] sword has devoured your prophets Like a destroying lion. 















###### 31 







"O generation [that you are], consider _and_ regard carefully the word of the LORD. Have I been a wilderness to Israel [like a land without food], A land of thick _and_ deep darkness [like a path without light]? Why do My people say, 'We [have broken loose and we] are _free to_ roam [at will]; We will no longer come to You'? 















###### 32 







"Can a virgin forget [to wear] her ornaments, Or a bride her attire [that identifies her as a married woman]? Yet My people have forgotten Me Days without number. 















###### 33 







"How well you prepare your path To seek _and_ obtain [adulterous] love! Even the most wicked of women Have learned [indecent] ways from you. 















###### 34 







"Also on your skirts is found The lifeblood of the innocent poor; You did not find them breaking in [a house]. But in spite of all these things [your disobedience, your love of idolatry, your lack of compassion]-- 















###### 35 







Yet you keep saying, 'I am innocent; Surely His anger has turned away from me.' Behold (listen very carefully), I will bring you to judgment _and_ will plead my case against you Because you say, 'I have not sinned.' 















###### 36 







"Why do you go around _and_ wander so much Changing your way? Also, you will be shamed by Egypt As you were shamed by Assyria. 















###### 37 







"From Egypt also you will come away [as captives] With your hands on your head; For the LORD has rejected those in whom you trust (confide), And you will not be successful with them." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

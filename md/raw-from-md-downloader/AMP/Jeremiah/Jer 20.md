# Jeremiah 20

***
















###### 1 







Now Pashhur the son of Immer, the priest, who was [also] chief officer in the house of the LORD, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things. 















###### 2 







Then Pashhur beat Jeremiah the prophet and put him in the stocks that were at the upper Benjamin Gate by the house of the LORD. 















###### 3 







And the next day Pashhur brought Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then Jeremiah said to him, "The LORD does not call your name Pashhur, but Magor-missabib (terror on every side). 















###### 4 







For thus says the LORD, 'Behold, I will make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends; they will fall by the sword of their enemies while you look on. And I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon; he will carry them away to Babylon as captives and will slaughter them with the sword. 















###### 5 







Moreover, I will hand over all the riches of this city, all the result of its labor, all its precious things; even all the treasures of the kings of Judah I will hand over to their enemies, and they will plunder them, and take them away and carry them to Babylon. 















###### 6 







And you, Pashhur, and all who live in your house will go into captivity; you will go to Babylon, and there you will die and be buried, you and all your friends to whom you have falsely prophesied.'" ## Jeremiah's Complaint 















###### 7 







[Jeremiah said,] O LORD, You have persuaded me and I was deceived; You are stronger than I and You have prevailed. I am a laughingstock all day long; Everyone mocks me. 















###### 8 







For whenever I speak, I must shout out; I shout violence and destruction, Because the word of the LORD has become to me A reprimand and a mockery _and_ has brought me insult all day long. 















###### 9 







If I say, "I will not remember Him Or speak His name anymore," Then my heart becomes a burning fire Shut up in my bones. And I am weary of enduring _and_ holding it in; I cannot endure it [nor contain it any longer]. 















###### 10 







For I have heard the whispering _and_ defaming words of many, "Terror on every side! Denounce him! Let us denounce him!" All my familiar _and_ trusted friends, [Those who are] watching for my fall, say, "Perhaps he will be persuaded _and_ deceived; then we will overcome him, And take our revenge on him." 















###### 11 







But the LORD is with me as a dread champion [one to be greatly feared]; Therefore my persecutors will stumble and not overcome [me]. They will be completely shamed, for they have not acted wisely _and_ have failed [in their schemes]; Their eternal dishonor will never be forgotten. 















###### 12 







But, O LORD of hosts, You who examine the righteous, Who see the heart and the mind, Let me see Your vengeance on them; For to You I have committed my cause. 















###### 13 







Sing to the LORD! Praise the LORD! For He has rescued the life of the needy one From the hand of evildoers. 















###### 14 







Cursed be the day on which I was born; Do not bless the day on which my mother gave birth to me! 















###### 15 







Cursed be the man who brought the news To my father, saying, "A son has been born to you!" Making him very glad. 















###### 16 







And let that man be like the cities Which the LORD overthrew without regret. Let him hear an outcry in the morning And a shout of alarm at noon; 















###### 17 







Because he did not kill me before my birth, So that my mother might have been my grave, And her womb always pregnant. 















###### 18 







Why did I come out of the womb To see trouble and sorrow, So that my days have been filled with shame? ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

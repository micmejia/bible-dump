# Jeremiah 27

***
















###### 1 







In the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD: 















###### 2 







Thus says the LORD to me, "Make for yourself bonds and yokes and put them on your neck, 















###### 3 







and send word to the king of Edom, to the king of Moab, to the king of the sons of Ammon, to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Sidon by the messengers who come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah. 















###### 4 







Command them to go to their masters, saying, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, you shall say this to your masters: 















###### 5 







"I have made the earth, the men and the animals that are on the face of the earth by My great power and by My outstretched arm, and I will give it to whomever pleases Me. 















###### 6 







Now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, My servant _and_ instrument, and I have also given the wild animals of the field to serve him. 















###### 7 







All nations shall serve him and his son and his grandson until the [appointed] time [of punishment] for his own land comes; then many nations and great kings shall make him their servant. 















###### 8 







"But any nation or kingdom that will not serve this same Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation I will punish," says the LORD, "with the sword, with famine and with pestilence (virulent disease), until I have destroyed it by Nebuchadnezzar's hand. 















###### 9 







And as for you, do not listen to your [counterfeit] prophets, your diviners, your dreams _and_ dreamers, your soothsayers or your sorcerers, who say to you, 'You will not serve the king of Babylon.' 















###### 10 







For they prophesy a lie to you which will cause you to be removed far from your land; and I will drive you out and you will perish. 















###### 11 







But the nation which will bow its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, that nation I will let remain on its own land," says the LORD, "to cultivate it and live in it."'" 















###### 12 







I spoke to Zedekiah king of Judah in the same way, saying, "Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him and his people, and live! 















###### 13 







Why will you die, you and your people, by the sword, by famine and by virulent disease, as the LORD has spoken to any nation which will not serve the king of Babylon? 















###### 14 







Do not listen to _and_ believe the words of the [false] prophets who are saying to you, 'You will not serve the king of Babylon,' for they prophesy a lie to you; 















###### 15 







for I have not sent them," says the LORD, "but they are prophesying falsely in My Name, in order that I may drive you out and that you may perish, you [together] with the [false] prophets who prophesy to you." 















###### 16 







Then I said to the priests and to all these people, saying, "Thus says the LORD: Do not listen to the words of your [false] prophets who are prophesying to you, saying, 'Behold, the articles of the Lord's house will now shortly be brought [^a]back from Babylon'; for they are prophesying a lie to you. 















###### 17 







Do not listen to them; serve the king of Babylon, and live! Why should this city become a ruin? 















###### 18 







But if they are [true] prophets, and if the word of the LORD is [really spoken] by them, let them now entreat the LORD of hosts that the articles which are [still] left in the house of the LORD, in the house of the king of Judah and in Jerusalem may not go to Babylon. 















###### 19 







For thus says the LORD of hosts concerning the [bronze] [^b]pillars, the [bronze] [^c]Sea, the [bronze] bases [of the ten basins in Solomon's temple used for washing sacrificial animals], and the rest of the articles that are left in this city (Jerusalem), 















###### 20 







which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take when he carried [^d]Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon, along with all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem. 















###### 21 







Yes, thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the articles which remain in the house of the LORD, in the house of the king of Judah and in Jerusalem, 















###### 22 







'They will be [^e]carried to Babylon and they will be there until the day that I visit them [with My favor],' says the LORD. 'Then I will bring them back and restore them to this place.'" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

The second time was during the reign of King Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, whom he took captive with all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem (27:20), at which time he carried away some of the sacred articles of the temple. The third siege was now imminent. [^b]: Jeremiah 27:19 Each pillar stood about twenty-seven feet high. [^c]: Jeremiah 27:19 This was the basin at which the priests washed their hands and feet before ministering at the altar. [^d]: Jeremiah 27:20 Also known as Jehoiachin and Coniah. [^e]: Jeremiah 27:22 This prophesy was fulfilled when the remaining sacred articles were carried to Babylon (2 Kin 25:13; 2 Chr 36:18; Jer 52:17-23), where they were kept for seventy years (2 Chr 36:21), the length of the captivity foretold by Jeremiah (Jer 29:10). They were then returned to Jerusalem (Ezra 1:7; 7:19).

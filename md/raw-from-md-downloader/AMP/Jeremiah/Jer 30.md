# Jeremiah 30

***
















###### 1 







The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD: 















###### 2 







"Thus says the LORD God of Israel, 'Write in a book all the words which I have spoken to you. 















###### 3 







For behold (hear this), the days are coming,' says the LORD, 'when I will restore the fortunes of My people Israel and Judah,' says the LORD, 'and I will return them to the land that I gave to their forefathers and they will take possession of it.'" 















###### 4 







Now these are the words the LORD spoke concerning Israel and Judah: 















###### 5 







"Thus says the LORD, 'We have heard a terrified voice Of panic _and_ dread, and there is no peace. 















###### 6 







'Ask now, and see Whether a man can give birth [to a child]. Why then do I see every man With his hands on his [^a]loins, as a woman in labor? Why have all faces turned pale? 















###### 7 







'Alas! for that day is great, There is none like it; It is the time of Jacob's [unequaled] trouble, But he will be saved from it. 















###### 8 







'It shall come about on that day,' says the LORD of hosts, 'that I will break the yoke off your neck and I will tear off your bonds _and_ force apart your shackles; and strangers will no longer make slaves of the people [of Israel]. 















###### 9 







But they shall serve the LORD their God and [the descendant of] David their King, whom I will raise up for them. 















###### 10 







'Fear not, O Jacob My servant,' says the LORD, 'Nor be dismayed _or_ downcast, O Israel; For behold, I will save you from a distant land [of exile] And your descendants from the land of their captivity. Jacob will return and will be quiet and at ease, And no one will make him afraid. 















###### 11 







'For I am with you,' says the LORD, 'to save you; For I will destroy completely all the nations where I have scattered you, But I will not destroy you completely. But I will judge _and_ discipline you fairly And will by no means regard you as guiltless _and_ leave you unpunished.' 















###### 12 







"For thus says the LORD, 'Your wound is incurable And your injury is beyond healing. 















###### 13 







'There is no one to plead your cause; No [device to close and allow the] healing of your wound, No recovery for you. 















###### 14 







'All your lovers (allies) have forgotten you; They do not seek _and_ long for you. For I have injured you with the wound of an enemy, With the punishment of a cruel _and_ merciless foe, Because your guilt is great And your sins are glaring _and_ innumerable. 















###### 15 







'Why do you cry out over your injury [since it is the natural result of your sin]? Your pain is incurable (deadly). Because your guilt is great And your sins are glaring _and_ innumerable, I have done these things to you. 















###### 16 







'Therefore all who devour you will be devoured; And all your adversaries, every one of them, will go into captivity. And they who plunder you will become plunder, And all who prey upon you I will give for prey. 















###### 17 







'For I will restore health to you And I will heal your wounds,' says the LORD, 'Because they have called you an outcast, saying: "This is Zion; no one seeks her _and_ no one cares for her."' ## Restoration of Jacob 















###### 18 







"Thus says the LORD, 'Behold (hear this), I will restore the fortunes of the tents of Jacob And have mercy on his dwelling places; The city will be rebuilt on its [old, mound-like] ruin, And the palace will stand on its rightful place. 















###### 19 







'From them (city, palace) will come [songs of] thanksgiving And the voices of those who dance _and_ celebrate. And I will multiply them and they will not be diminished [in number]; I will also honor them and they will not be insignificant. 















###### 20 







'Their children too will be as in former times, And their congregation will be established before Me; And I will punish all their oppressors. 















###### 21 







'Their prince will be one of them, And their ruler will come forward from among them. I will bring him near and he shall approach Me, For who is he who would have the boldness _and_ would dare [on his own initiative] to risk his life to approach Me?' says the LORD. 















###### 22 







'Then you shall be My people, And I will be your God.'" 















###### 23 







Behold, the tempest of the LORD! Wrath has gone forth, A sweeping _and_ gathering tempest; It will burst on the head of the wicked. 















###### 24 







The fierce (righteous) anger of the LORD will not turn back Until He has fulfilled and until He has accomplished The intent of His heart (mind); In the latter days you will understand this. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

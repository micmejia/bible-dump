# Jeremiah 33

***
















###### 1 







Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the second time, while he was still confined in the court of the guard, saying, 















###### 2 







"Thus says the LORD who made _the earth_, the LORD who formed it to establish it--the LORD is His name, 















###### 3 







'Call to Me and I will answer you, and tell you [and even show you] great and mighty things, [things which have been confined and hidden], which you do not know _and_ understand _and_ cannot distinguish.' 















###### 4 







For thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city and the houses of the kings of Judah which are torn down _to make a defense_ against the siege ramps and against the sword, 















###### 5 







'While they (the besieged Jews) are coming to fight against the Chaldeans and to fill the houses with the dead bodies of men whom I have slain in My anger and in My wrath, for I have hidden My face [in disgust] from this city because of all their wickedness. 















###### 6 







Behold, [in the restored Jerusalem] I will bring to it health and healing, and I will heal them; and I will reveal to them an abundance of peace (prosperity, security, stability) and truth. 















###### 7 







I will restore the fortunes of Judah and the fortunes of Israel and will rebuild them as they were at first. 















###### 8 







I will cleanse them from all their wickedness (guilt) by which they have sinned against Me, and I will pardon (forgive) all their sins by which they rebelled against Me. 















###### 9 







Jerusalem will be to Me a name of joy, praise and glory before all the nations of the earth which will hear of all the good that I do for it, and they shall fear and tremble because of all the good and all the peace (prosperity, security, stability) that I provide for it.' 















###### 10 







"Thus says the LORD, 'Yet again there will be heard in this place of which you say, "It is a [desolate] waste, without man and without animal"--even in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate, without man and without inhabitant and without animal-- 















###### 11 







the [sound of the] voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the [song-filled] voice of those who say, "Give praise _and_ thanks to the LORD of hosts, For the LORD is good; For His [steadfast] lovingkindness (mercy) endures forever"; _and of those_ who bring a thank offering into the house of the LORD. For I will restore the fortunes of the land as they were at first,' says the LORD. 















###### 12 







"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'There will again be in this desolate place--[a place] without man or animal--and in all its cities, pastures for shepherds who rest their flocks. 















###### 13 







In the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland, in the cities of the South (the Negev), in the land of Benjamin, in the places around Jerusalem and in the cities of Judah, the flocks will again pass under the hand of the one who counts them,' says the LORD. ## The Davidic Kingdom 















###### 14 







'Behold, the days are coming,' says the LORD, 'when I will fulfill the good word _and_ promise which I have made regarding the house of Israel and the house of Judah. 















###### 15 







In those days and at that time I will cause a righteous Branch of David to spring forth; and He (the Messiah) shall execute justice and righteousness on the earth. 















###### 16 







In those days Judah will be saved and [the people of] Jerusalem will live in safety; and this is _the name_ by which she will be called: the LORD Our Righteousness (Justice).' 















###### 17 







For thus says the LORD, 'David shall never lack a man (descendant) to sit on the throne of the house of Israel; 















###### 18 







and the Levitical priests shall never lack a man (descendant) to offer burnt offerings before Me and to burn grain offerings and to prepare sacrifices all day long.'" 















###### 19 







The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying, 















###### 20 







"Thus says the LORD, 'If you can break My covenant for the day and My covenant for the night, so that day and night do not take place at their appointed times, 















###### 21 







then My covenant may also be broken with David My servant so that he will not have a son to reign on his throne, and [My covenant may also be broken] with the Levitical priests, My ministers. 















###### 22 







As the host of [the stars of] heaven cannot be counted and the sand of the sea cannot be measured, so I will multiply the descendants of David My servant and the Levites who minister to Me.'" 















###### 23 







And the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying, 















###### 24 







"Have you not noticed what this people have spoken, saying, 'The two families [Israel the northern kingdom, and Judah the southern kingdom] which the LORD chose, He has rejected'? Thus they despise My [chosen] people, no longer are they [considered] as a nation in their sight. 















###### 25 







Thus says the LORD, 'If My covenant with day and night does not stand, and if I have not established the fixed patterns of heaven and earth, [the whole order of nature,] 















###### 26 







then I would [also] reject the descendants of Jacob and David My servant, not taking from his descendants rulers over the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. But I will restore their fortunes, and will have mercy on them.'" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

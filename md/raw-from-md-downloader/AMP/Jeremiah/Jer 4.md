# Jeremiah 4

***
















###### 1 







"If you will return, O Israel," says the LORD, "If you will return to Me, And if you will put away your detestable things _and_ remove your man-made gods from My sight, And not stray _or_ waver, 















###### 2 







And if you swear [your oaths], 'As the LORD lives,' In truth, in justice, and in righteousness, Then the nations will bless themselves in Him, And in Him they will glory." 















###### 3 







For this is what the LORD says to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem, "Plow your uncultivated ground [for a season], And do not sow among thorns. 















###### 4 







"Circumcise (dedicate, sanctify) yourselves to the LORD And remove the foreskin [sins] of your heart, Men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem, Or else My wrath will go forth like fire [consuming all that gets in its way] And burn and there will be no one to quench it, Because of the evil of your acts." 















###### 5 







Declare in Judah and proclaim in Jerusalem, and say, "Blow the trumpet in the land; Cry aloud and say, 'Assemble yourselves, and let us go Into the fortified cities.' 















###### 6 







"Raise a banner toward Zion [to mark the way for those seeking safety inside Jerusalem's walls]! Seek refuge, do not stand [immobile], For I am bringing evil from the north (the army of Babylon), And great destruction. 















###### 7 







"A lion has left his lair, And a destroyer of nations is on his way. He has gone out from his place To desolate your land; Your cities will be in ruins Without an inhabitant. 















###### 8 







"For this reason, put on sackcloth [for mourning], Lament (mourn with expressions of grief for the dead) and wail, For the fierce anger of the LORD Has not turned back from us." 















###### 9 







"It shall come about in that day," says the LORD, "that the heart _and_ courage of the king will fail (be paralyzed), and also the heart of the princes; the priests will be appalled and the prophets will be astounded _and_ horrified." 















###### 10 







Then I said, "[^a]Alas, Lord God! Surely You have completely deceived _and_ misled this people and Jerusalem, [for the prophets represented You as] saying [to Your people], 'You will have peace,' but [in fact] a sword reaches to their throat." 















###### 11 







In that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, "A scorching wind from the barren heights in the wilderness [comes at My command] against the daughter of My people--not [a wind] to winnow and not to cleanse [from chaff, as when threshing, but] 















###### 12 







a wind too strong _and_ full for this comes at My word. Now I will also speak judgment against My people." 















###### 13 







"Behold, the enemy comes up like clouds, His chariots like the whirlwind; His horses are swifter than eagles. Woe (judgment is coming) to us, for we are ruined!" 















###### 14 







O Jerusalem, wash your heart from wickedness, That you may be saved. How long will your wicked _and_ immoral thoughts Lodge within you? 















###### 15 







For a voice declares from Dan [far in the north], And proclaims evil from [^b]Mount Ephraim. 















###### 16 







"Warn the [neighboring] nations now [that our enemy is coming]! Announce to Jerusalem, 'Besiegers are coming from a far country, And they lift their voices _and_ shout against the cities of Judah. 















###### 17 







'Like watchmen of a field they are against her on all sides, Because she has rebelled against Me,' says the LORD. 















###### 18 







"Your ways and your deeds Have brought these things on you. This is your tragedy _and_ doom; how bitter, How it has touched your heart!" ## Lament over Judah's Devastation 















###### 19 







My soul, my soul! I writhe in anguish _and_ pain! Oh, the walls of my heart! My heart is pounding _and_ throbbing within me; I cannot be silent, For you have heard, O my soul, The sound of the trumpet, The alarm of war. 















###### 20 







News of one [terrible] disaster comes close after another, For the whole land is devastated; Suddenly my tents are spoiled _and_ destroyed, My [tent] curtains [ruined] in a moment. 















###### 21 







How long [O LORD] must I see the banner [marking the way for flight] And hear the sound of the trumpet [urging the people to run for safety]? 















###### 22 







"For My people are stupid _and_ foolish," [says the LORD to Jeremiah]; "They do not know Me; They are foolish children And have no understanding. They are shrewd [enough] to do evil, But they do not know [how] to do good." 















###### 23 







I looked at the earth [in my vision], and behold, it was [as at the time of creation] formless and void; And to the heavens, and they had no light. 















###### 24 







I looked at the mountains, and behold, they were trembling, And all the hills moved back and forth. 















###### 25 







I looked, and behold, there was no man, And all the birds of the air had fled. 















###### 26 







I looked, and behold, the fertile land was a wilderness, And all its cities were pulled down Before the [presence of the] LORD, before His fierce anger. 















###### 27 







Therefore says the LORD, "The whole land shall be a desolation, Yet I will not cause total destruction. 















###### 28 







"For this reason the earth shall mourn And the heavens above shall become dark, Because I have spoken, I have decided, And I will not change my mind (relent), nor will I turn back from it." 















###### 29 







Every city runs away at the sound of the horsemen and archers. They go into the thickets and climb among the rocks; Every city is deserted, And no man lives in them. 















###### 30 







And you, O desolate one, what will you do? Though you clothe yourself in scarlet, Though you adorn _yourself with_ ornaments of gold, Though you enlarge your eyes with paint, You make yourself beautiful in vain. Your lovers (allies) despise you; They seek your life. 















###### 31 







For I heard a cry like a woman in labor, The anguish as of one giving birth to her first child, The cry of the Daughter of Zion (Jerusalem), who gasps for breath, Who stretches out her hands, saying, "Woe is me [my judgment comes]! I faint [in fear] before the murderers." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Jeremiah 47

***
















###### 1 







The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines before Pharaoh attacked _and_ conquered [the Philistine city of] Gaza. 















###### 2 







Thus says the LORD: "Behold, waters are going to rise out of the north (Babylonia) And become an overflowing stream And overflow the land and all that is in it, The city and those who live in it. Then the people will cry out, And all the inhabitants of the land [of Philistia] will wail. 















###### 3 







"Because of the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of the war-horses [of the Babylonian king], The rattling of his chariots, and the rumbling of his wheels, The fathers have not looked _and_ turned back for their children, So weak are their hands [with terror] 















###### 4 







Because of the day that is coming To destroy all the Philistines And to cut off from Tyre and Sidon Every ally who remains. For the LORD is going to destroy the Philistines, The remnant [still surviving] of the coastland of [^a]Caphtor. 















###### 5 







"Baldness [as a sign of mourning] will come on Gaza; Ashkelon will be cut off _and_ ruined. O remnant of their valley, How long will you gash yourselves [as a sign of mourning]? 















###### 6 







"O you sword of the LORD, How long will it be before you are quiet? Put yourself into your sheath; Rest and be still. 















###### 7 







"How can His sword be quiet When the LORD has given it an order? Against Ashkelon and against the [whole Philistine] seashore There He has assigned it." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

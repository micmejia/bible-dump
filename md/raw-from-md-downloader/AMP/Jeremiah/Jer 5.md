# Jeremiah 5

***
















###### 1 







"Roam back and forth through the streets of Jerusalem, And look now and take note. And look in her open squares _To see_ if you can find a man [as Abraham sought in Sodom], One who is just, who [has integrity and moral courage and] seeks truth (faithfulness); Then I will pardon Jerusalem--[for the sake of one uncompromisingly righteous person]. 















###### 2 







"And though they say, 'As the LORD lives,' Surely they swear [their oaths] falsely." 















###### 3 







O LORD, do not Your eyes look for truth? You [have seen their faithless heart and] have stricken them, But they did not weaken; You have consumed them, But they refused to take correction _or_ instruction. They have made their faces harder than rock; They have refused to repent _and_ return to You. 















###### 4 







Then I said, "[Surely] these are only the poor (uneducated); They are [sinfully] foolish _and_ have no [spiritual] understanding, For they do not know the way of the LORD Or the ordinance of their God [and the requirements of His just and righteous law]. 















###### 5 







"I will go to the great [men] And speak to them, For they [must] know the way of the LORD, The ordinance of their God." But [I found the reverse to be true, that] they too had all alike broken the yoke [of God's law] And had burst the bonds [of obedience to Him]. 















###### 6 







Therefore a lion from the forest will kill them, A wolf of the deserts will destroy them, A leopard is watching their cities. Everyone who goes out of them shall be torn in pieces, Because their transgressions are many, Their desertions of faith are countless. 















###### 7 







"Why should I [overlook these offenses and] forgive you? Your children have abandoned (rejected) Me And sworn [their oaths] by those who are not gods. When I had fed them until they were full [and bound them to Me by a promise], They committed [spiritual] adultery, Assembling in troops at the houses of prostitutes (idols). 















###### 8 







"They were like well-fed, lusty stallions, Each one neighing after his neighbor's wife. 















###### 9 







"Shall I not punish them [for these things]?" says the LORD; "Shall I not avenge Myself On a nation such as this?" 















###### 10 







"Go up through the rows of Jerusalem's vineyards and destroy [them], But do not completely destroy _everything_. Strip away her branches _and_ the tendrils [of her vines], For they are not the Lord's. 















###### 11 







"For the house of Israel and the house of Judah Have dealt very treacherously (faithlessly) with Me," declares the LORD. 















###### 12 







They have lied about _and_ denied the LORD By saying, "It is not He [who speaks through His prophets]; Misfortune _and_ evil shall not come on us, Nor will we see war or famine. 















###### 13 







"The prophets are like the [^a]wind [their prophecy will not come to pass], And the word [of God] is not in them. In this manner it will be done to them [as they prophesied, not to us]." ## Judgment Proclaimed 















###### 14 







Therefore, thus says the LORD God of hosts, "Because you [people] have spoken this word, Behold, I am making My words a fire in your mouth [Jeremiah] And this people wood, and My words will consume them. 















###### 15 







"Behold, I am bringing a nation against you from far away, O house of Israel," says the LORD. "It is a mighty _and_ enduring nation, It is an ancient nation, A nation whose language you do not know, Whose words you do not comprehend. 















###### 16 







"Their quiver is [filled with the dead] like an open grave; They are all mighty men [heroes of their nation]. 















###### 17 







"They will consume your harvest and [eat up] your bread; They will consume your sons and your daughters; They will consume your flocks and your herds; They will consume your vines and your fig trees. With the sword they will break down _and_ demolish your fortified cities in which you trust. 















###### 18 







"But even in those days," says the LORD, "I will not totally destroy you. 















###### 19 







It will come about when your people say, 'Why has the LORD our God done all these things to us?' then you shall answer them, 'As you have abandoned (rejected) Me,' [says the LORD,] 'and have served strange _and_ foreign gods in your land, so you will serve strangers in a land that is not yours.' 















###### 20 







"Declare this in the house of Jacob And proclaim it in Judah, saying: 















###### 21 







'Now hear this, O foolish people without heart, Who have eyes but do not see, Who have ears but do not hear. 















###### 22 







'Do you not fear Me?' says the LORD. 'Do you not tremble [in awe] in My presence? For I have placed the sand as a boundary for the sea, An eternal decree _and_ a perpetual barrier beyond which it cannot pass. Though the waves [of the sea] toss _and_ break, yet they cannot prevail [against the sand ordained to hold them back]; Though the waves _and_ the billows roar, yet they cannot cross over [the barrier]. [Is not such a God to be feared?] 















###### 23 







'But this people has a stubborn heart and a rebellious will [that draws them away from Me]; They have turned away and have gone [into idolatry]. 















###### 24 







'They do not say in their heart, "Let us now fear _and_ worship the LORD our God [with profound awe and reverence], Who gives rain in its season, Both the autumn and the spring rain, Who keeps for us The appointed weeks of the harvest." 















###### 25 







'Your wickedness has turned these [blessings] away, And your sins have withheld good [harvests] from you. 















###### 26 







'For wicked men are found among My people, They watch like fowlers who lie in wait; They set a trap, They catch men. 















###### 27 







'As a cage is full of birds, So are their houses full of deceit _and_ treachery; Therefore they have become influential and rich. 















###### 28 







'They are fat and they are sleek (prosperous), They [^b]excel in acts of wickedness; They do not plead the cause, The cause of the orphan, so that they [the wicked] may prosper, And they do not defend the rights of the poor. 















###### 29 







'Shall I not punish them [for these things]?' says the LORD. 'Shall I not avenge Myself On such a nation as this?' 















###### 30 







"An appalling and horrible thing [bringing desolation and destruction] Has come to pass in the land: 















###### 31 







The prophets prophesy falsely, And the priests rule [^c]on their own authority; And My people love [to have] it so!

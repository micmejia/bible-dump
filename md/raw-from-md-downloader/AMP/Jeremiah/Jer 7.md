# Jeremiah 7

***
















###### 1 







The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, 















###### 2 







"Stand in the gate of the Lord's house and proclaim there this word and say, 'Hear the word of the LORD, all you of Judah who enter by these gates to worship the LORD.'" 















###### 3 







Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "Change your ways and your behavior, and I will let you live in this place. 















###### 4 







Do not trust in the deceptive _and_ lying words [of the false prophets who claim that Jerusalem will be protected by God because of the temple], saying, 'This is the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD.' 















###### 5 







For if you thoroughly change your ways and your behavior, if you thoroughly _and_ honestly practice justice between a man and his neighbor, 















###### 6 







if you do not oppress the transient _and_ the foreigner, the orphan, or the widow, and do not shed innocent blood [by oppression and by unjust judicial murders] in Jerusalem, nor follow after other gods to your own ruin, 















###### 7 







then I will let you live in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers [to live in] forever and ever. 















###### 8 







"Behold, you are trusting in deceptive _and_ useless words that bring no benefit. 















###### 9 







Will you steal, murder, commit adultery, swear [oaths] falsely, offer sacrifices _or_ burn incense to Baal, and follow after other gods that you have not known, 















###### 10 







and [then dare to] come and stand before Me in this house, which is called by My [^a]Name, and say, 'We are protected _and_ set free [by this act of religious ritual]!'--only to go on with this wickedness _and_ these disgusting and loathsome things? 















###### 11 







Has this house, which is called by My Name, become a den of robbers in your eyes [a place of retreat for you between acts of violence]? Behold, I Myself have seen it," says the LORD. 















###### 12 







"But go now to My place which was in Shiloh [in Ephraim], where I first set My Name, and see what I did to it because of the wickedness of My people Israel. 















###### 13 







And now, because you have done all these things," says the LORD, "and I spoke [persistently] to you, even rising up early and speaking, but you did not listen, and I called you but you did not answer, 















###### 14 







therefore, I will do to this house (the temple) which is called by My Name, in which you trust, and to the place which I gave you and your fathers, just as I did to Shiloh. 















###### 15 







I will cast you out of My sight, as I have cast out all your brothers (relatives through Jacob), all the descendants of Ephraim. 















###### 16 







"Therefore, do not pray for this people [of Judah] or lift up a cry or entreaty for them or make intercession to Me, for I do not hear you. 















###### 17 







Do you not see what they are doing in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? 















###### 18 







The children gather wood, the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead the dough to make cakes for the [^b]queen of heaven; and they pour out drink offerings to other gods that they may offend _and_ provoke Me to anger. 















###### 19 







Do they offend _and_ provoke Me to anger?" says the LORD. "Is it not themselves [they offend], to their own shame?" 















###### 20 







Therefore thus says the Lord God, "Behold, My anger and My wrath will be poured out on this place, on man and beast, on the trees of the field and the fruit of the ground; and it will burn and [the fire will] not be quenched." 















###### 21 







Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "Add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices and eat the meat. 















###### 22 







For in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, I did not speak to your fathers or command them concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices. 















###### 23 







But this thing I did command them: 'Listen to _and_ obey My voice, and I will be your God, and you shall be My people; and you will walk in all the way which I command you, so that it may be well with you.' 















###### 24 







But they did not obey Me or bend their ear [to hear Me], but followed the counsels and the stubbornness of their [own] evil heart (mind), and [they turned and] went backward instead of forward. 















###### 25 







Since the day that your fathers came out of the land of Egypt until this day, I have [persistently] sent you all My servants the prophets, sending them daily, early [and late]. 















###### 26 







Yet they did not listen to Me _and_ obey Me or bend their ear [to hear Me], but stiffened their neck; they did more evil _and_ behaved worse than their fathers. 















###### 27 







"You shall speak all these words to them, but they will not listen to you; and you shall [also] call to them, but they will not answer you. 















###### 28 







You shall say to them, 'This is the nation that did not obey the voice of the LORD their God or accept correction _and_ warning; truth _and_ faithfulness have perished and have completely vanished from their mouths. 















###### 29 







'Cut off your hair [your crown, O Jerusalem] and throw it away, And take up a mournful cry on the barren heights, For the LORD has rejected and abandoned The generation of His wrath.' 















###### 30 







For the children of Judah have done evil in My sight," says the LORD; "they have set their disgusting _and_ shamefully vile things in the house which is called by My Name, to defile it. 















###### 31 







They have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the Valley of Ben-hinnom (son of Hinnom), to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire [to honor Molech, the fire god]--which I did not command, nor did it come into My heart (mind). 















###### 32 







"Therefore, behold, the days are coming," declares the LORD, "when it will no longer be called Topheth or the Valley of Ben-hinnom, but the Valley of the Slaughter, for [in bloody warfare] they will bury [the dead] in Topheth until there is no more room. 















###### 33 







And the dead bodies of this people will be food for the birds of the air and for the beasts of the earth and no one will frighten them away. 















###### 34 







Then I will cause the voices of joy and gladness, and the voices of the bridegroom and the bride to vanish from the cities of Judah and from the streets of Jerusalem; for the land will become a ruin--a wasteland. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

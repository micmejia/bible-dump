# Jeremiah 9

***
















###### 1 







Oh that my head were waters And my eyes a fountain of tears, That I might weep day and night For the slain of the daughter of my people! 















###### 2 







Oh that I had in the wilderness A lodging place (a mere shelter) for wayfaring men, That I might leave my people And go away from them! For they are all adulterers [worshiping idols instead of the LORD], [They are] an assembly of treacherous men [of weak character, men without integrity]. 















###### 3 







"They bend their tongue like their bow; [Their] lies and not truth prevail _and_ grow strong in the land; For they proceed from evil to evil, And they do not know _and_ understand _and_ acknowledge Me," says the LORD. 















###### 4 







"Let everyone beware of his neighbor And do not trust any brother. For every brother is a supplanter [like Jacob, a deceiver, ready to grab his brother's heel], And every neighbor goes around as a slanderer. 















###### 5 







"Everyone deceives _and_ mocks his neighbor And does not speak the truth. They have taught their tongue to speak lies; They exhaust themselves with sin _and_ cruelty. 















###### 6 







"Your dwelling is in the midst of deceit [oppression upon oppression and deceit upon deceit]; Through deceit they refuse to know (understand) Me," says the LORD. 















###### 7 







Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, "Behold, I will refine them [through suffering] and test them; For how else should I deal with the daughter of My people? 















###### 8 







"Their tongue is a murderous arrow; It speaks deceit; With his mouth one speaks peace to his neighbor, But in his heart he lays traps _and_ waits in ambush for him. 















###### 9 







"Shall I not punish them for these things?" says the LORD. "Shall I not avenge Myself On such a nation as this? 















###### 10 







"I will take up a weeping and wailing for the mountains, And a [funeral] dirge for the pastures of the wilderness, Because they are burned up _and_ desolated so that no one passes through [them]; Nor can anyone hear the lowing of cattle. Both the birds of the air and the beasts have fled; they are gone. 















###### 11 







"I will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins, A haunt _and_ dwelling place of jackals; And I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant." 















###### 12 







Who is the wise man who may understand this [without any doubt]? To whom has the mouth of the LORD spoken, so that he may declare it? Why is the land ruined, laid waste like a wilderness, so that no one passes through? 















###### 13 







The LORD said, "Because they have [^a]turned away from My law which I set before them, and have not listened to _and_ obeyed My voice nor walked in accordance with it, 















###### 14 







but have walked stubbornly after their [own] heart and after the Baals, as their fathers taught them," 















###### 15 







therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "behold, I will feed them, this people, with wormwood and give them bitter _and_ poisonous water to drink. 















###### 16 







I will [also] scatter them among nations that neither they nor their fathers have known, and I will send the sword after them until I have annihilated them." 















###### 17 







Thus says the LORD of hosts, "Consider and call for the mourning women to come; Send for the wailing women to come. 















###### 18 







"Let them hurry and take up a wailing for us, That our eyes may shed tears And our eyelids flow with water. 















###### 19 







"For a sound of wailing is heard [coming] from Zion: 'How we are ruined! We are greatly perplexed _and_ utterly shamed, Because we have left the land, Because they have torn down our dwellings.'" 















###### 20 







Now hear the word of the LORD, O you women, And let your ear hear the word of His mouth; Teach your daughters a song of mourning, And each one [teach] her neighbor a dirge. 















###### 21 







For death has come up through our windows; It has entered our palaces, Cutting off the children from the streets And the young men from the town squares. 















###### 22 







Speak, "Thus says the LORD, 'The dead bodies of men will fall like dung on the open field, And like sheaves [of grain] behind the reaper, And no one will gather them.'" 















###### 23 







Thus says the LORD, "Let not the one who is wise _and_ skillful boast in his insight; let not the one who is mighty _and_ powerful boast in his strength; let not the one who is rich boast in his [temporal satisfactions and earthly] abundance; 















###### 24 







but let the one who boasts boast in this, that he understands and knows Me [and acknowledges Me and honors Me as God and recognizes without any doubt], that I am the LORD who practices lovingkindness, justice and righteousness on the earth, for in these things I delight," says the LORD. 















###### 25 







"Behold, the days are coming," says the LORD, "when I will punish all who are circumcised [physically] and yet uncircumcised [spiritually]-- 















###### 26 







[^b]Egypt and Judah, and Edom and the sons of Ammon, and Moab and all those who live in the desert who clip off the hair on their temples; for all these nations are uncircumcised (sinful, impure), and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

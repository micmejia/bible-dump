# Job 10

***
















###### 1 







"I am disgusted with my life _and_ loathe it! I will give free expression to my complaint; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul. 















###### 2 







"I will say to God, 'Do not condemn me [and declare me guilty]! Show me why You contend _and_ argue _and_ struggle with me. 















###### 3 







'Does it indeed seem right to You to oppress, To despise _and_ reject the work of Your hands, And to look with favor on the schemes of the wicked? 















###### 4 







'Do You have eyes of flesh? Do You see as a man sees? 















###### 5 







'Are Your days as the days of a mortal, Are Your years as man's years, 















###### 6 







That You seek my guilt And search for my sin? 















###### 7 







'Although You know that I am not guilty _or_ wicked, Yet there is no one who can rescue me from Your hand. 















###### 8 







'Your hands have formed and made me altogether. Would You [turn around and] destroy me? 















###### 9 







'Remember now, that You have made me as clay; So will You turn me into dust again? 















###### 10 







'Have You not poured me out like milk And curdled me like cheese? 















###### 11 







'[You have] clothed me with skin and flesh, And knit me together with bones and sinews. 















###### 12 







'You have granted me life and lovingkindness; And Your providence (divine care, supervision) has preserved my spirit. 















###### 13 







'Yet these [present evils] You have hidden in Your heart [since my creation]: I know that this was within You [in Your purpose and thought]. 















###### 14 







'If I sin, then You would take note _and_ observe me, And You would not acquit me of my guilt. 















###### 15 







'If I am wicked, woe to me [for judgment comes]! And if I am righteous, I dare not lift up my head. For I am sated _and_ filled with disgrace and the sight of my misery. 















###### 16 







'Should I lift my head up, You would hunt me like a lion; And again You would show Your marvelous power against me. 















###### 17 







'You renew Your witnesses against me And increase Your indignation _and_ anger toward me; Hardship after hardship is with me [attacking me time after time]. 















###### 18 







'Why then did You bring me out of the womb? Would that I had perished and no eye had seen me! 















###### 19 







'I should have been as though I had not existed; [I should have been] carried from the womb to the grave.' 















###### 20 







"Would He not let my few days alone, Withdraw from me that I may have a little cheer 















###### 21 







Before I go--and I shall not return-- To the land of darkness and the deep shadow [of death], 















###### 22 







The [sunless] land of utter gloom as darkness _itself_, [The land] of the shadow of death, without order, And [where] it shines as [thick] darkness." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Job 11

***
















###### 1 







Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said, 















###### 2 







"Shall a multitude of words not be answered? And should a talkative man [making such a long-winded defense] be acquitted? 















###### 3 







"Should your boasts _and_ babble silence men? And shall you scoff and no one put you to shame? 















###### 4 







"For you have said, 'My teaching (doctrine) [that God knowingly afflicts the righteous] is pure, And I am innocent in your eyes.' 















###### 5 







"But oh, that God would speak, And open His lips [to speak] against you, 















###### 6 







And [that He would] show you the secrets of wisdom! For sound wisdom [^a]has two sides. Know therefore that God forgets a part of your wickedness _and_ guilt. 















###### 7 







"Can you discover the depths of God? Can you [by searching] discover the limits of the Almighty [ascend to His heights, extend to His widths, and comprehend His infinite perfection]? 















###### 8 







"_His wisdom_ is as high as the heights of heaven. What can you do? It is deeper than Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead). What can you know? 















###### 9 







"It is longer in measure [and scope] than the earth, And broader than the sea. 















###### 10 







"If God passes by or arrests, Or calls an assembly [of judgment], who can restrain Him? [If He is against a man, who can call Him to account for it?] 















###### 11 







"For He recognizes _and_ knows false _and_ worthless men, And He sees wickedness, will He not consider it? 















###### 12 







"But a hollow (empty-headed) man will become intelligent _and_ wise [Only] when the [^b]colt of a wild donkey is born as a man. 















###### 13 







"If you direct your heart [on the right path] And stretch out your hands to Him, 















###### 14 







If sin is in your hand, put it far away [from you], And do not let wrongdoing dwell in your tents; 















###### 15 







Then, indeed, you could lift up your face [to Him] without _moral_ defect, And you would be firmly established _and_ secure and not fear. 















###### 16 







"For you would forget your trouble; You would remember it as waters that have passed by. 















###### 17 







"And your [^c]life would be brighter than the noonday; Darkness [then] would be like the morning. 















###### 18 







"Then you would trust [with confidence], because there is hope; You would look around you and rest securely. 















###### 19 







"You would lie down with no one to frighten you, And many would entreat _and_ seek your favor. 















###### 20 







"But the eyes of the wicked will fail, And they will not escape [the justice of God]; And their hope is to breathe their last [and die]." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

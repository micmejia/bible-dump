###### 2 







"No doubt you are the [only wise] people [in the world], And wisdom will die with you! 















###### 3 







"But I have intelligence _and_ understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you. Who does not know such things as these [of God's wisdom and might]? 















###### 4 







"I am a joke to my friends; I, one whom God answered when he called upon Him-- A just and blameless man is a joke [and laughed to scorn]. 















###### 5 







"He who is at ease has contempt for misfortune, _But misfortune is_ ready [and anxiously waiting] for those whose feet slip. 















###### 6 







"The tents of the destroyers prosper; And those who provoke God are [apparently] secure, Whom God brings into their power. 















###### 7 







"Now ask the animals, and let them teach you [that God does not deal with His creatures according to their character]; And ask the birds of the air, and let them tell you; 















###### 8

###### 10 







In whose hand is the life of every living thing, And the breath of all mankind? 















###### 11

###### 13 







"But [only] with Him are [perfect] wisdom and might; He [alone] has [true] counsel and understanding. 















###### 14 







"Behold, He tears down, and it cannot be rebuilt; He imprisons a man, and there can be no release. 















###### 15 







"Behold, He restrains the waters, and they dry up; Again, He sends the waters out, and they overwhelm _and_ devastate the earth. 















###### 16 







"With Him are might and sound wisdom, The misled and the misleader are His [and in His power]. 















###### 17 







"He makes [great and scheming] counselors walk barefoot And makes fools of judges. 















###### 18 







"He loosens the bond of kings And binds their loins with a loincloth. 















###### 19 







"He makes priests walk barefoot, And He overturns men firmly seated _and_ secure. 















###### 20 







"He deprives the trusted ones of speech And takes away the discernment _and_ discretion of the aged. 















###### 21 







"He pours contempt on princes _and_ nobles And loosens the belt of the strong [disabling them]. 















###### 22 







"He uncovers mysteries [that are difficult to grasp and understand] out of the darkness And brings black gloom _and_ the shadow of death into light. 















###### 23 







"He makes nations great, and He destroys them; He enlarges nations, and leads them away [captive]. 















###### 24 







"He removes intelligence _and_ understanding from the leaders of the people of the earth And makes them wander _and_ move blindly in a pathless waste.

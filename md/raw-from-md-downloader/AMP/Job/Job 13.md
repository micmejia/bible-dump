# Job 13

***
















###### 1 







[Job continued:] "Behold, my eye has seen all _this_, My ear has heard and understood it. 















###### 2 







"What you know I also know; I am not inferior to you. 















###### 3 







"But I wish to speak to [^a]the Almighty, And I desire to argue with God. 















###### 4 







"But you smear me with lies [you defame my character most untruthfully]; You are all worthless physicians _and_ have no remedy to offer. 















###### 5 







"Oh, that you would be completely silent, And that _silence_ would be your wisdom! 















###### 6 







"Please hear my argument And listen to the pleadings of my lips. 















###### 7 







"Will you speak what is unjust for God, And speak what is deceitful for Him? 















###### 8 







"Will you show partiality for Him [and be unjust to me so that you may gain favor with Him]? Will you contend _and_ plead for God? 















###### 9 







"Will it be well for you when He investigates you [and your tactics against me]? Or will you deceive Him as one deceives a man? 















###### 10 







"He will surely reprimand you If you secretly show partiality. 















###### 11 







"Will not His majesty terrify you, And will not the dread of Him fall upon you? 















###### 12 







"Your memorable sayings are [worthless, merely] proverbs of ashes; Your defenses are defenses of [crumbling] clay. ## Job Is Sure He Will Be Vindicated 















###### 13 







"Be silent before me so that I may speak; And let happen to me what may. 















###### 14 







"Why should I take my flesh in my teeth And put my life in my hands [incurring the wrath of God]? 















###### 15 







"Even though He kills me; I will hope in Him. Nevertheless, I will argue my ways to His face. 















###### 16 







"This also will be my salvation, For a godless man may not come before Him. 















###### 17 







"Listen diligently to my speech, And let my declaration fill your ears. 















###### 18 







"Behold now, I have prepared my case; I know that I will be vindicated. 















###### 19 







"Who will argue _and_ contend with me? For then I would be silent and die. 















###### 20 







"Only [O Lord,] do not do two things to me, And then I will not hide myself from Your face: 















###### 21 







Withdraw Your hand from me _and_ remove this bodily suffering, And let not the dread of You terrify me. 















###### 22 







"Then [Lord,] call, and I will answer; Or let me speak, and then reply to me. 















###### 23 







"How many are my iniquities and sins [that so much sorrow should come to me]? Make me recognize _and_ understand my transgression and my sin. 















###### 24 







"Why do You hide Your face [as if offended] And consider me Your enemy? 















###### 25 







"Will You cause a windblown leaf to tremble? Will You pursue the chaff of the dry stubble? 















###### 26 







"For You write bitter things against me [in Your indictment] And make me inherit _and_ suffer for the iniquities of my youth. 















###### 27 







"You also put my feet in the stocks [as punishment] And [critically] observe all my paths; You set a circle _and_ limit around the soles of my feet [which I must not overstep], 















###### 28

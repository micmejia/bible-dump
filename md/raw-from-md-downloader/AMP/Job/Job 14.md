# Job 14

***
















###### 1 







"Man, who is born of a woman, Is short-lived and full of turmoil. 















###### 2 







"Like a flower he comes forth and withers; He also flees like a shadow and does not remain. 















###### 3 







"You also open Your eyes upon him And bring him into judgment with Yourself. 















###### 4 







"Who can make a clean thing out of the unclean? No one! 















###### 5 







"Since his days are determined, The number of his months is with You [in Your control], And You have made his limits so he cannot pass [his allotted time]. 















###### 6 







"[O God] turn your gaze from him so that he may rest, Until he fulfills his day [on earth] like a hired man. 















###### 7 







"For there is hope for a tree, If it is cut down, that it will sprout again, And that the shoots of it will not cease _nor_ fail, [but there is no such hope for man]. 















###### 8 







"Though its roots grow old in the earth And its stump dies in the dry soil, 















###### 9 







Yet at the scent of water [the stump of the tree] will flourish And bring forth sprigs _and_ shoots like a seedling. 















###### 10 







"But [the brave, strong] man must die and lie face down; Man breathes his last, and where is he? 















###### 11 







"As water evaporates from the sea, And a river drains and dries up, 















###### 12 







So man lies down and does not rise [again]. Until the heavens are no longer, _The dead_ will not awake nor be raised from their sleep. 















###### 13 







"Oh, that You would hide me in Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead), That You would conceal me until Your wrath is past, That You would set a definite time and then remember me [and in Your lovingkindness imprint me on your heart]! 















###### 14 







"If a man dies, will he live again? I will wait all the days of my struggle Until my change _and_ release will come. 















###### 15 







"[Then] You will call, and I will answer You; You will long for [me] the work of Your hands. 















###### 16 







"But now You number [each of] my steps; You do not observe _nor_ take note of my sin. 















###### 17 







"My transgression is sealed up in a bag, And You cover my wickedness [from Your view]. 















###### 18 







"But as a mountain, if it falls, crumbles into nothing, And as the rock is moved from its place, 















###### 19 







Water wears away the stones, Its floods _and_ torrents wash away the soil of the earth, So You [O Lord] destroy the hope of man. 















###### 20 







"You prevail forever against him _and_ overpower him, and he passes on; You change his appearance and send him away [from the presence of the living]. 















###### 21 







"His sons achieve honor, and he does not know it; They become insignificant, and he is not aware of it. 















###### 22 







"But his body [lamenting its decay] grieves in pain over it, And his soul mourns over [the loss of] himself." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

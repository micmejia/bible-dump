# Job 15

***
















###### 1 







Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered [Job] and said, 















###### 2 







"Should a wise man [such as you] utter such windy _and_ vain knowledge [as we have just heard] And fill himself with the east wind [of withering, parching, and violent accusations]? 















###### 3 







"Should he rebuke _and_ argue with useless talk? Or with words in which there is no benefit? 















###### 4 







"Indeed, you are doing away with fear, And you are diminishing meditation before God. 















###### 5 







"For your guilt teaches your mouth, And you choose [to speak] the language of the crafty _and_ cunning. 















###### 6 







"Your own mouth condemns you, and not I; Yes, your own lips testify against you. 















###### 7 







"Were you the first man to be born [the original wise man], Or were you created before the hills? 















###### 8 







"Do you hear the secret counsel of God, And do you limit [the possession of] wisdom to yourself? 















###### 9 







"What do you know that we do not know? _What_ do you understand that is not equally clear to us? 















###### 10 







"Among us are both the gray-haired and the aged, Older than your father. 















###### 11 







"Are the consolations of God [as we have interpreted them to you] too trivial for you, [Or] were we too gentle toward you [in our first speech] to be effective? 















###### 12 







"Why does your heart carry you away [allowing you to be controlled by emotion]? And why do your eyes flash [in anger or contempt], 















###### 13 







That you should turn your spirit against God And let _such_ words [as you have spoken] go out of your mouth? 















###### 14 







"What is man, that he should be pure _and_ clean, Or he who is born of a woman, that he should be righteous _and_ just? 















###### 15 







"Behold, God puts no trust in His holy ones (angels); Indeed, the heavens are not pure in His sight-- 















###### 16 







How much less [pure and clean is] the one who is repulsive and corrupt, Man, who drinks unrighteousness _and_ injustice like water! ## What Eliphaz Has Seen of Life 















###### 17 







"I will tell you, listen to me; And what I have seen I will also declare; 















###### 18 







What wise men have [freely] told, And have not hidden [anything passed on to them] from their fathers, 















###### 19 







To whom alone the land was given, And no stranger passed among them [corrupting the truth]. 















###### 20 







"The wicked man writhes with pain all his days, And numbered are the years stored up for him, the ruthless one. 















###### 21 







"A [dreadful] sound of terrors is in his ears; While at peace _and_ in a time of prosperity the destroyer comes upon him [the tent of the robber is not at peace]. 















###### 22 







"He does not believe that he will return out of the darkness [for fear of being murdered], And he is destined for the sword [of God's vengeance]. 















###### 23 







"He wanders about for food, saying, 'Where is it?' He knows that the day of darkness _and_ destruction is already at hand. 















###### 24 







"Distress and anxiety terrify him, They overpower him like a king ready for battle. 















###### 25 







"Because he has stretched out his hand against God And behaves arrogantly against [^a]the Almighty, 















###### 26 







Running _and_ charging headlong against Him With his ornamented _and_ massive shield; 















###### 27 







For he has covered his face with his fat, Adding layers of fat to his thighs [giving himself up to pleasures], 















###### 28 







And he has lived in desolate [God-forsaken] cities, In houses which no one should inhabit, Which were destined to become heaps [of ruins]; 















###### 29 







He will not become rich, nor will his wealth endure; And his grain will not bend to the earth _nor_ his possessions be extended on the earth. 















###### 30 







"He will not escape from darkness [fleeing disaster]; The flame [of God's wrath] will wither his branch, And by the blast of His mouth he will go away. 















###### 31 







"Let him not trust in vanity (emptiness, futility) and be led astray; For emptiness will be his [^b]reward [for such living]. 















###### 32 







"It will be fulfilled while he still lives, And his branch will not be green [but shall wither away]. 















###### 33 







"He will fail to bring his grapes to maturity [leaving them to wither unnourished] on the vine, And will cast off blossoms [and fail to bring forth fruit] like the olive tree. 















###### 34 







"For the company of the godless is barren, And fire consumes the tents of bribery (wrong and injustice). 















###### 35 







"They conceive mischief and bring forth wickedness, And their inmost soul prepares deceit _and_ fraud." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

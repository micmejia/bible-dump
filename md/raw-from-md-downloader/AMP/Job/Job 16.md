# Job 16

***
















###### 1 







Then Job answered and said, 















###### 2 







"I have heard many such things; Wearisome _and_ miserable comforters are you all. 















###### 3 







"Is there no end to [your futile] words of wind? Or what plagues you [so much] that you [so boldly] answer [me like this]? 















###### 4 







"I also could speak like you, If you were in my place; I could compose _and_ join words together against you And shake my head at you. 















###### 5 







"[But instead] I could strengthen _and_ encourage you with [the words of] my mouth, And the consolation _and_ solace of my lips would soothe your suffering _and_ lessen your anguish. ## Job Says God Shattered Him 















###### 6 







"If I speak [to you miserable comforters], my pain is not relieved; And if I refrain [from speaking], what [pain or anguish] leaves me? 















###### 7 







"But now God has exhausted me. You [O Lord] have destroyed all my family _and_ my household. 















###### 8 







"You have taken a firm hold on me _and_ have shriveled me up, It has become a witness [against me]; And my leanness [and infirmity] rises up [as evidence] against me, It testifies to my face [about my guilt]. 















###### 9 







"His wrath has torn me and hunted me down, He has gnashed at me with his teeth; My adversary sharpens His gaze _and_ glares [with piercing eyes] at me. 















###### 10 







"They have gaped at me with their mouths, With contempt they have struck me on the cheek; They massed themselves together [and conspired] against me. 















###### 11 







"God hands me over to [^a]criminals And tosses me [headlong] into the hands of the wicked. 















###### 12 







"I was [living] at ease, but He crushed me _and_ broke me apart, And He has seized me by the neck and has shaken me to pieces; He has also set me up as His target. 















###### 13 







"His arrows surround me. He pierces my kidneys (vital organs) without mercy; He pours out my gall on the ground. 















###### 14 







"He attacks me, making wound after wound; He runs at me like a warrior. 















###### 15 







"I have sewed sackcloth over my skin [as a sign of mourning] And have defiled my horn (symbol of strength) in the dust. 















###### 16 







"My face is red _and_ swollen with weeping, And on my eyelids is the shadow of death [my eyes are dimmed], 















###### 17 







Although there is no violence _or_ wrongdoing in my hands, And my prayer is pure. 















###### 18 







"O earth, do not cover my blood, And let there be no [resting] place for my cry [where it will cease being heard]. 















###### 19 







"Even now, behold, my Witness is in heaven, And my Advocate [who vouches and testifies for me] is on high. 















###### 20 







"My friends are scoffers [who ridicule]; My eye pours out tears to God. 















###### 21 







"Oh, that a man would mediate _and_ plead with God [for me] Just as a man [mediates and pleads] with his neighbor _and_ friend. 















###### 22

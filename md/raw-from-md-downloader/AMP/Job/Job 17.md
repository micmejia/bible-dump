# Job 17

***
















###### 1 







"My spirit is broken, my days are extinguished, The grave is _ready_ for me. 















###### 2 







"Surely there are mockers _and_ mockery with me, And my eye gazes on their obstinacy _and_ provocation. 















###### 3 







"Give me a pledge (guarantee, promise) with Yourself [acknowledge my innocence before my death]; Who is there that will [^a]be my guarantor _and_ give security for me? 















###### 4 







"But You [Lord] have closed their hearts to understanding, Therefore You will not exalt them [by giving a verdict against me]. 















###### 5 







"He who denounces _and_ informs against his friends for a share _of the spoil_, The eyes of his children will also languish _and_ fail. 















###### 6 







"But He has made me a byword _and_ mockery among the people, And I have become one in whose face people spit. 















###### 7 







"My eye has grown dim (unexpressive) because of grief, And all my [body's] members are [wasted away] like a shadow. 















###### 8 







"The upright will be [astonished and] appalled at this, And the innocent will stir himself up against the godless _and_ polluted. 















###### 9 







"Nevertheless the righteous will hold to his ways, And he who has clean hands will grow stronger and stronger. 















###### 10 







"But as for all of you, come back again, Even though I do not find a wise man among you. 















###### 11 







"My days are past, my purposes _and_ plans are frustrated _and_ torn apart; The wishes of my heart [are broken]. 















###### 12 







"These [thoughts try to] make the night into the day; 'The light is near,' _they say_ in the presence of darkness [but they pervert the truth]. 















###### 13 







"But if I look to Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead) as my home, If I make my bed in the darkness, 















###### 14 







If I call out to the pit (grave), 'You are my father'; And to the worm [that feeds on decay], 'You are my mother and my sister [because I will soon be closest to you],' 















###### 15 







Where now is my hope? And who regards _or_ considers _or_ is even concerned about my hope? 















###### 16 







"Will my hope go down with me to Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead)? Shall we go down together in the dust?" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Job 18

***
















###### 1 







Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said, 















###### 2 







"How long will you hunt for words _and_ continue these speeches? Do some clear thinking _and_ show understanding and then we can talk. 















###### 3 







"Why are we regarded as beasts, As if [we are] stupid (senseless) in your eyes? 















###### 4 







"You who tear yourself apart in anger, Is the earth to be abandoned for your sake, Or the rock to be moved out of its place? 















###### 5 







"Indeed, the light of the wicked will be put out, And the flame of his fire will not shine. 















###### 6 







"The light will be dark in his tent, And his lamp beside him will be put out. 















###### 7 







"The vigorous stride will be shortened, And his own counsel _and_ the scheme [in which he trusted] will bring his downfall. 















###### 8 







"For the wicked is thrown into a net by his own feet (wickedness), And he steps on the webbing [of the lattice-covered pit]. 















###### 9 







"A snare catches him by the heel, And a trap snaps shut on him. 















###### 10 







"A noose is hidden for him on the ground, And a trap for him on the path. 















###### 11 







"Terrors frighten him on every side And chase at his heels. 















###### 12 







"The strength [of the wicked] is famished _and_ weakened, And disaster is ready at his side [if he stops]. 















###### 13 







"His skin is devoured by disease; The firstborn of death [the worst of diseases] consumes his limbs. 















###### 14 







"He is torn from his tent which he trusted [for safety], And he is marched _and_ brought to the king of terrors (death). 















###### 15 







"Nothing of his dwells in his tent; Brimstone (burning sulfur) is scattered over his dwelling [to purify it]. 















###### 16 







"The roots [of the wicked] are dried up below, And above, his branch is cut off _and_ withers. 















###### 17 







"Memory of him perishes from the earth, And he has no name on the street. 















###### 18 







"He is driven _and_ propelled from light into darkness, And chased from the inhabited world. 















###### 19 







"He has no offspring or prosperity among his people, Nor any survivor where he sojourned. 















###### 20 







"Those in the west are astonished _and_ appalled at his fate, And those in the east are seized with horror. 















###### 21 







"Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked _and_ the ungodly, And such is the place of him who does not know _or_ recognize _or_ honor God." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Job 19

***
















###### 1 







Then Job answered and said, 















###### 2 







"How long will you torment _and_ exasperate me And crush me with words? 















###### 3 







"These ten times you have insulted me; You are not ashamed to wrong me [and harden your hearts against me]. 















###### 4 







"And if it were true that I have erred, My error would remain with me [and I would be conscious of it]. 















###### 5 







"If indeed you [braggarts] vaunt _and_ magnify yourselves over me And prove my disgrace (humiliation) to me, 















###### 6 







Know then that God has wronged me _and_ overthrown me And has closed His net around me. ## Everything Is Against Him 















###### 7 







"Behold, I cry out, 'Violence!' but I am not heard; I shout for help, but there is no justice. 















###### 8 







"He has walled up my way so that I cannot pass, And He has set darkness upon my paths. 















###### 9 







"He has stripped me of my honor And removed the crown from my head. 















###### 10 







"He breaks me down on every side, and I am gone; He has uprooted my hope like a tree. 















###### 11 







"He has also kindled His wrath [like a fire] against me And He considers _and_ counts me as one of His adversaries. 















###### 12 







"His troops come together And build up their way _and_ siege works against me And camp around my tent. 















###### 13 







"He has put my brothers far from me, And my acquaintances are completely estranged from me. 















###### 14 







"My relatives have failed [me], And my intimate friends have forgotten me. 















###### 15 







"Those who live [temporarily] in my house and my maids consider me a stranger; I am a foreigner in their sight. 















###### 16 







"I call to my servant, but he does not answer; I have to implore him with words. 















###### 17 







"My breath is repulsive to my wife, And I am loathsome to my own brothers. 















###### 18 







"Even young children despise me; When I get up, they speak against me. 















###### 19 







"All the men of my council hate me; Those I love have turned against me. 















###### 20 







"My bone clings to my skin and to my flesh, And I have escaped [death] by the skin of my teeth. 















###### 21 







"Have pity on me! Have pity on me, O you my friends, For the hand of God has touched me. 















###### 22 







"Why do you persecute me as God _does_? Why are you not satisfied with my flesh (anguish)? ## Job Says, "My Redeemer Lives" 















###### 23 







"Oh, that the words I now speak were written! Oh, that they were recorded in a scroll! 















###### 24 







"That with an iron stylus and [molten] lead They were engraved in the rock forever! 















###### 25 







"For I know that my Redeemer _and_ Vindicator lives, And at the last He will take His stand upon the earth. 















###### 26 







"Even after my [mortal] skin is destroyed [by death], Yet from my [immortal] flesh I will see God, 















###### 27 







Whom I, even I, will see for myself, And my eyes will see Him and not another! My heart faints within me. 















###### 28 







"If you say, 'How shall we [continue to] persecute him?' And 'What pretext for a case against him can we find [since we claim the root of these afflictions is found in him]?' 















###### 29 







"_Then_ beware _and_ be afraid of the sword [of divine vengeance] for yourselves, For wrathful are the punishments of that sword, So that you may know there is judgment." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

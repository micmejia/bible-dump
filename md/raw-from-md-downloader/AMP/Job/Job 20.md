# Job 20

***
















###### 1 







Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said, 















###### 2 







"Therefore my disquieting thoughts make me answer, Because of the uneasiness that is within me. 















###### 3 







"I have heard the reproof which insults me, But the spirit of my understanding makes me answer. 















###### 4 







"Do you not know this from the old days, Since the time that man was placed on the earth, 















###### 5 







That the triumphing of the wicked is short, And the joy of the godless is only for a moment? 















###### 6 







"Though his pride reaches the heavens And his head touches the clouds, 















###### 7 







_Yet_ he perishes forever like his own refuse; Those who have seen him will say, 'Where is he?' 















###### 8 







"He flies away like a dream and cannot be found; Yes, he is chased away like a vision of the night. 















###### 9 







"The eye which saw him sees him no longer, Neither does his [accustomed] place behold him any longer. 















###### 10 







"His sons favor the poor [and pay his obligations], And his hands give back his [ill-gotten] wealth. 















###### 11 







"His bones are full of youthful strength But it lies down with him in the dust. 















###### 12 







"Though evil _and_ wickedness are sweet in his mouth And he hides it under his tongue, 















###### 13 







Though he desires it and will not let it go But holds it in his mouth, 















###### 14 







_Yet_ his food turns [to poison] in his stomach; It is the venom of vipers within him. 















###### 15 







"He swallows [his ill-gotten] riches, But will vomit them up; God will drive them out of his belly. 















###### 16 







"He sucks the poison of vipers [which ill-gotten wealth contains]; The viper's tongue slays him. 















###### 17 







"He does not look at the rivers, The flowing streams of honey and butter [to enjoy his wealth]. 















###### 18 







"He gives back what he has labored for _and_ attained And cannot swallow it [down to enjoy it]; As to the riches of his labor, He cannot even enjoy them. 















###### 19 







"For he has oppressed and neglected the poor; He has violently taken away houses which he did not build. 















###### 20 







"Because he knew no quietness _or_ calm within him [because of his greed], He does not retain anything he desires. 















###### 21 







"There is nothing left of what he devoured; Therefore his prosperity does not endure. 















###### 22 







"In the fullness of his excess (great abundance) he will be in trouble; The hand of everyone who suffers will come against him [he is miserable on every side]. 















###### 23 







"When he fills his belly, _God_ will send His fierce anger on him And will rain it upon him while he is eating. 















###### 24 







"He may flee from the iron weapon, _But_ the bow of bronze will pierce him through. 















###### 25 







"_The arrow_ is drawn forth and it comes out of his back [after passing through his body]; Yes, the glittering point comes out of his gall. Terrors march in upon him; 















###### 26 







Complete darkness (misfortune) is held in reserve for his treasures. An unfanned fire will devour him; It will consume the survivor in his tent. 















###### 27 







"The heavens will reveal his wickedness _and_ guilt, And the earth will rise up against him. 















###### 28 







"The produce _and_ increase of his house will depart [with the victors]; _His possessions_ will be dragged away in the day of God's wrath. 















###### 29

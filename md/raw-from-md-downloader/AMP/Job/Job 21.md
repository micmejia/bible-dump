# Job 21

***
















###### 1 







Then Job answered and said, 















###### 2 







"Listen carefully to my speech, And let this be the consolation. 















###### 3 







"Bear with me, and I also will speak; And after I have spoken, you may [continue to] mock [me]. 















###### 4 







"As for me, is my complaint to man _or_ about him? And why should I not be impatient _and_ my spirit troubled? 















###### 5 







"Look at me and be astonished _and_ appalled; And put your hand over your mouth. 















###### 6 







"Even when I remember, I am troubled _and_ afraid; Horror _and_ trembling take hold of my flesh. 















###### 7 







"Why do the wicked _still_ live, Become old, and become mighty in power? 















###### 8 







"Their children _and_ descendants are established with them in their sight, And their offspring before their eyes. 















###### 9 







"Their houses are safe from fear; And the rod of God is not on them. 















###### 10 







"His bull breeds and does not fail; His cow calves and does not miscarry. 















###### 11 







"They send forth their little ones like a flock, And their children skip about. 















###### 12 







"They lift up their voices _and_ sing to the tambourine and the lyre And rejoice to the sound of the flute. 















###### 13 







"They fully enjoy their days in prosperity, And so go down to Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead) in a [peaceful] moment. 















###### 14 







"Yet they say to God, 'Depart from us, For we do not desire the knowledge of Your ways. 















###### 15 







'Who [and what] is [^a]the Almighty, that we should serve Him? And what would we gain if we plead with Him?' 















###### 16 







"_But_ notice, the prosperity _of the wicked_ is not in their hand (in their power); The counsel of the wicked [and the mystery of God's dealings with the ungodly] is far from my comprehension. 















###### 17 







"How often [then] is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out, And that their disaster falls on them? Does God distribute pain _and_ destruction _and_ sorrow [to them] in His anger? 















###### 18 







"Are they like straw before the wind, And like chaff that the storm steals _and_ carries away? 















###### 19 







"_You say_, 'God stores away [the punishment of] man's wickedness for his children.' Let God repay him so that he may know _and_ experience it. 















###### 20 







"Let his own eyes see his destruction, And let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty. 















###### 21 







"For what pleasure does he have in his house _and_ family after he is dead, When the number of his months [of life] is cut off? 















###### 22 







"Can anyone teach God knowledge, Seeing that He judges those on high? 















###### 23 







"One dies in his full strength, Being wholly at ease and quiet _and_ satisfied; 















###### 24 







His pails are full of milk [his sides are filled out with fat], And the marrow of his bones is moist, 















###### 25 







Whereas another dies with a bitter soul, Never even tasting pleasure _or_ good fortune. 















###### 26 







"Together they lie down in the dust, And the worms cover them. 















###### 27 







"Behold, I know your thoughts, And the plots by which you would wrong me. 















###### 28 







"For you say, 'Where is the house of the noble man? And where is the tent, the dwelling place of the wicked?' 















###### 29 







"Have you not asked those who travel this way, And do you not recognize their witness? 















###### 30 







"That evil men are [now] reserved for the day of disaster _and_ destruction, They will be led away on the day of [God's] wrath? 















###### 31 







"_But_ who will confront him with his actions _and_ rebuke him face to face, And who will repay him for what he has done? 















###### 32 







"When he is carried to his grave, _A guard_ will keep watch over his tomb. 















###### 33 







"The [dirt] clods of the valley are sweet to him [and gently cover him], Moreover, all men will follow after him [to a grave], While countless ones go before him. 















###### 34

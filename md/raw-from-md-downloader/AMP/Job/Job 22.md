# Job 22

***
















###### 1 







Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, 















###### 2 







"Can a vigorous man be of use to God, Or a wise man be useful to himself? 















###### 3 







"Is it any pleasure _or_ joy to [^a]the Almighty that you are righteous? Or is it of benefit to Him that you make your ways perfect? 















###### 4 







"Is it because of your fear of Him that He corrects you, That He enters into judgment against you? 















###### 5 







"Is not your wickedness great, And your sins without end? 















###### 6 







"For you have taken pledges of your brothers without cause, And stripped men naked. 















###### 7 







"You have not given water to the weary to drink, And you have withheld bread from the hungry. 















###### 8 







"But the land is possessed by the man with power, And the favored _and_ honorable man dwells in it. 















###### 9 







"You have sent widows away empty-handed, And the arms (strength) of the fatherless have been broken. 















###### 10 







"Therefore snares surround you, And sudden dread terrifies _and_ overwhelms you; 















###### 11 







Or darkness, so that you cannot see, And a flood of water covers you. 















###### 12 







"Is not God in the height of heaven? And behold the distant stars, how high they are! 















###### 13 







"You say, 'What does God know [about me]? Can He judge through the thick darkness? 















###### 14 







'Thick clouds are a hiding place for Him, so that He cannot see, And He walks on the vault (circle) of the heavens.' 















###### 15 







"Will you keep to the ancient path That wicked men walked [in the time of Noah], 















###### 16 







Men who were snatched away before their time, Whose foundations were poured out like a river? 















###### 17 







"They said to God, 'Depart from us! What can the Almighty do for us _or_ to us?' 















###### 18 







"Yet He filled their houses with good _things_; But the counsel of the wicked _and_ ungodly is far from me. 















###### 19 







"The righteous see it and are glad; And the innocent mock _and_ laugh at them, _saying_, 















###### 20 







'Surely our adversaries are cut off _and_ destroyed, And fire has consumed their abundance.' 















###### 21 







"Now yield _and_ submit yourself to Him [agree with God and be conformed to His will] and be at peace; In this way [you will prosper and great] good will come to you. 















###### 22 







"Please receive the law _and_ instruction from His mouth And establish His words in your heart _and_ keep them. 















###### 23 







"If you return to the Almighty [and submit and humble yourself before Him], you will be built up [and restored]; _If_ you remove unrighteousness far from your tents, 















###### 24 







And place your gold in the dust, And _the gold of_ Ophir among the stones of the brooks [considering it of little value], 















###### 25 







And make the Almighty your gold And your precious silver, 















###### 26 







Then you will have delight in the Almighty, And you will lift up your face to God. 















###### 27 







"You will pray to Him, and He will hear you, And you will pay your vows. 















###### 28 







"You will also decide _and_ decree a thing, and it will be established for you; And the light [of God's favor] will shine upon your ways. 















###### 29 







"When you are cast down _and_ humbled, you will speak with confidence, And the humble person He will lift up _and_ save. 















###### 30 







"He will even rescue the one [for whom you intercede] who is not innocent; And he will be rescued through the cleanness of your hands." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

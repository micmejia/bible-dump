# Job 23

***
















###### 1 







Then Job answered and said, 















###### 2 







"Even today my complaint is contentious; His hand is heavy despite my groaning. 















###### 3 







"Oh, that I knew where I might find Him, That I might [even] come to His seat! 















###### 4 







"I would present my cause before Him And fill my mouth with arguments. 















###### 5 







"I would learn the words which He would answer, And understand what He would say to me. 















###### 6 







"Would He contend against me with His great power? No, surely He would give attention to me. 















###### 7 







"There the righteous and upright could reason with Him; So I would be acquitted forever by my Judge. 















###### 8 







"Behold, I go forward (to the east), but He is not there; I go backward (to the west), but I cannot perceive Him; 















###### 9 







To the left (north) He turns, but I cannot behold Him; He turns to the right hand (south), but I cannot see Him. 















###### 10 







"But He knows the way that I take [and He pays attention to it]. _When_ He has tried me, I will come forth as [refined] gold [pure and luminous]. 















###### 11 







"My feet have carefully followed His steps; I have kept His ways and not turned aside. 















###### 12 







"I have not departed from the commandment of His lips; I have kept the words of His mouth more than my necessary food. 















###### 13 







"But He is unique _and_ unchangeable, and who can turn Him? And _what_ His soul desires, that He does. 















###### 14 







"For He performs what is planned (appointed) for me, And He is mindful of many such things. 















###### 15 







"Therefore I would be terrified at His presence; _When_ I consider [all of this], I tremble in dread of Him. 















###### 16 







"For God has made my heart faint, And the Almighty has terrified me, 















###### 17 







But I am not silenced by the darkness [of these woes that fell on me], Nor by the thick darkness which covers my face. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

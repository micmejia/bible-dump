# Job 24

***
















###### 1 







"Why does the Almighty not set seasons for judgment? Why do those who know Him not see His days [for punishment of the wicked]? 















###### 2 







"Some remove the landmarks; They [violently] seize and pasture flocks [appropriating land and flocks openly]. 















###### 3 







"They drive away the donkeys of the orphans; They take the widow's ox for a pledge. 















###### 4 







"They crowd the needy off the road; The poor of the land all hide themselves. 















###### 5 







"Behold, as wild donkeys in the desert, The poor go to their work, diligently seeking food; As bread for their children in the desert. 















###### 6 







"They harvest their fodder in a field [that is not their own], And glean the vineyard of the wicked. 















###### 7 







"They spend the night naked, without clothing, And have no covering against the cold. 















###### 8 







"They are wet from the rain of the mountains And cling to the rock for lack of shelter. 















###### 9 







"Others snatch the fatherless [infants] from the breast [to sell or make them slaves], And against the poor they take a pledge [of clothing]. 















###### 10 







"They cause _the poor_ to go about naked without clothing, And they take away the sheaves [of grain] from the hungry. 















###### 11 







"Within the walls [of the wicked] the poor make [olive] oil; They tread [the grapes in] the wine presses, but thirst. 















###### 12 







"From the [populous and crowded] city men groan, And the souls of the wounded cry out for help; Yet God [seemingly] does not pay attention to the wrong [done to them]. 















###### 13 







"Others have been with those who rebel against the light; They do not want to know its ways Nor stay in its paths. 















###### 14 







"The murderer rises at dawn; He kills the poor and the needy, And at night he becomes a thief. 















###### 15 







"The eye of the adulterer waits for the twilight, Saying, 'No eye will see me,' And he covers his face. 















###### 16 







"In the dark they dig into [the penetrable walls of] houses; They shut themselves up by day; They do not know the light [of day]. 















###### 17 







"For the morning is the same to him as the thick darkness [of midnight]; For he is familiar with the terrors of thick darkness. 















###### 18 







"They are insignificant on the surface of the water; Their portion is cursed on the earth; They do not turn toward the vineyards. 















###### 19 







"Drought and heat consume the snow waters; _So does_ Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead) [consume] _those who_ have sinned. 















###### 20 







"A mother will forget him; The worm feeds on him until he is no longer remembered. And wickedness will be broken like a tree [which cannot be restored]. 















###### 21 







"He preys on the barren (childless) woman And does no good for the widow. 















###### 22 







"Yet God draws away the mighty by His power; He rises, but no one has assurance of life. 















###### 23 







"God gives them security, and they are supported; And His eyes are on their ways. 















###### 24 







"They are exalted for a little while, and then they are gone; Moreover, they are brought low and like everything [they are] gathered up _and_ taken out of the way; Even like the heads of grain they are cut off. 















###### 25

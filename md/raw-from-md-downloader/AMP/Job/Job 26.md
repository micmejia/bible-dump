# Job 26

***
















###### 1 







But Job answered and said, 















###### 2 







"What a help you are to the weak (powerless)! How you have saved the arm that is without strength! 















###### 3 







"How you have counseled the one who has no wisdom! And how abundantly you have provided sound wisdom _and_ helpful insight! 















###### 4 







"To whom have you uttered [these] words? And whose spirit [inspired what] came forth from you? ## The Greatness of God 















###### 5 







"The spirits of the dead tremble Underneath the waters and their inhabitants. 















###### 6 







"Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead) is naked before God, And Abaddon (the place of destruction) has no covering [from His eyes]. 















###### 7 







"_It is_ He _who_ spreads out the north over emptiness And [^a]hangs the earth on nothing. 















###### 8 







"He wraps the waters in His clouds [which otherwise would spill on earth all at once], And the cloud does not burst under them. 















###### 9 







"He covers the face of the [^b]full moon And spreads His cloud over it. 















###### 10 







"He has inscribed a circular limit (the horizon) on the face of the waters At the boundary between light and darkness. 















###### 11 







"The pillars of the heavens tremble And are terrified at His rebuke. 















###### 12 







"He stirred up the sea by His power, And by His understanding He smashed [proud] [^c]Rahab. 















###### 13 







"By His breath the heavens are cleared; His hand has pierced the [swiftly] fleeing serpent. 















###### 14 







"Yet these are just the fringes of His ways [mere samples of His power], The faintest whisper of His voice! Who can contemplate the thunder of His [full] mighty power?" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

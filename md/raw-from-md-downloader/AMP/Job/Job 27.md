# Job 27

***
















###### 1 







Job continued his discourse and said, 















###### 2 







"As God lives, who has taken away my right _and_ denied me justice, And the Almighty, who has caused bitterness _and_ grief for my soul, 















###### 3 







As long as my life is within me, And the breath of God is [still] in my nostrils, 















###### 4 







My lips will not speak unjustly, Nor will my tongue utter deceit. 















###### 5 







"Far be it from me that I should admit you are right [in your accusations against me]; Until I die, I will not remove my integrity from me. 















###### 6 







"I hold fast my uprightness _and_ my right standing with God and I will not let them go; My heart does not reproach me for any of my days. ## The State of the Godless 















###### 7 







"May my enemy be as the wicked, And he who rises up against me be as the unrighteous (unjust). 















###### 8 







"For what is the hope of the godless, even though he has gained [in this world], When God takes his life? 















###### 9 







"Will God hear his cry When trouble _and_ distress come upon him? 















###### 10 







"Will he take delight in the Almighty? Will he call on God at all times? 















###### 11 







"I will teach you regarding the hand (power) of God; I will not conceal what is with the Almighty [God's actual treatment of the wicked]. 















###### 12 







"Behold, all of you have seen it; Why then do you act vainly _and_ foolishly [cherishing worthless concepts]? 















###### 13 







"This [which I am about to explain] is the portion of a wicked man from God, And the inheritance which tyrants _and_ oppressors receive from the Almighty: 















###### 14 







"Though his children are many, they are destined for the sword; And his descendants will not have sufficient bread. 















###### 15 







"Those who survive him will be buried because of the plague, And [their] widows will not be able to weep. 















###### 16 







"Though he heaps up silver like dust And piles up clothing like clay, 















###### 17 







He may prepare it, but the just will wear it And the innocent will divide the silver. 















###### 18 







"He builds his house like a spider's web, Like a (temporary) hut which a watchman makes. 















###### 19 







"He lies down rich, but never will again; He opens his eyes, and it is gone. 















###### 20 







"Terrors overtake him like a [suddenly rising] flood; A windstorm steals him away in the night. 















###### 21 







"The east wind lifts him up, and he is gone; It sweeps him out of his place. 















###### 22 







"For it will hurl [thunderbolts of God's wrath] at him unsparingly _and_ without compassion; He flees in haste from its power. 















###### 23 







"People will clap their hands at him [to mock and ridicule him] And hiss him out of his place. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Job 28

***
















###### 1 







"Surely there is a mine for silver, And a place where they refine gold. 















###### 2 







"Iron is taken out of the earth, And copper is smelted from the stone ore. 















###### 3 







"_Man_ puts an end to darkness [by bringing in a light], And to the farthest bounds he searches out The rock buried in gloom and deep shadow. 















###### 4 







"He breaks open (mine) shafts far away from where people live, [In places] forgotten by the [human] foot; They dangle [in the mines] and hang away from men. 















###### 5 







"[As for] the earth, out of it comes food, But underneath [its surface, down deep] it is turned over as fire. 















###### 6 







"Its stones are the bed of sapphires; It holds dust of gold. 















###### 7 







"The path [deep within] no bird of prey knows, And the falcon's eye has not caught sight of it. 















###### 8 







"The proud beasts [and their young] have not walked on it, Nor has the _fierce_ lion passed over it. 















###### 9 







"Man puts his hand on [and tears apart] the flinty rock; He overturns the mountains at the base [looking for treasure]. 















###### 10 







"He cuts out channels _and_ passages among the rocks; And his eye sees every precious thing. 















###### 11 







"Man dams up the streams from flowing [so that they do not trickle into the mine], And what is hidden he brings out to the light. ## The Search for Wisdom Is Harder 















###### 12 







"But where can wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding? 















###### 13 







"Man does not know the value of it; Nor is it found in the land of the living. 















###### 14 







"The deep says, 'It is not in me'; And the sea says, 'It is not with me.' 















###### 15 







"It cannot be obtained for pure gold, Nor can silver be weighed as its price. 















###### 16 







"It cannot be valued in [terms of] the gold of Ophir, In the precious onyx _or_ beryl, or the sapphire. 















###### 17 







"Gold and glass cannot equal wisdom, Nor can it be exchanged for articles of fine gold. 















###### 18 







"No mention of coral and crystal can be made; For the possession of wisdom is even above [that of] rubies _or_ pearls. 















###### 19 







"The topaz of Ethiopia cannot compare with it, Nor can it be valued in pure gold. 















###### 20 







"From where then does wisdom come? And where is the place of understanding? 















###### 21 







"It is hidden from the eyes of all the living And concealed from the birds of the heavens. 















###### 22 







"Abaddon (the place of destruction) and Death say, 'We have [only] heard a report of it with our ears.' 















###### 23 







"God understands the way [to wisdom] And He knows its place [for wisdom is with God alone]. 















###### 24 







"For He looks to the ends of the earth And sees everything under the heavens. 















###### 25 







"When He gave weight _and_ pressure to the wind And allotted the waters by measure, 















###### 26 







When He made a limit for the rain And a way for the thunderbolt, 















###### 27 







Then He saw wisdom and declared it; He established it and searched it out. 















###### 28 







"But to man He said, 'Behold, the reverential _and_ worshipful fear of the Lord--that is wisdom; And to depart from evil is understanding.'" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Job 30

***
















###### 1 







"But now those younger than I mock _and_ laugh at me, Whose fathers I refused to put with the sheepdogs of my flock. 















###### 2 







"Indeed, how could the strength of their hands profit me? Vigor had perished from them. 















###### 3 







"They are gaunt with want and famine; They gnaw the dry _and_ barren ground by night in [the gloom of] waste and desolation. 















###### 4 







"They pluck [and eat] [^a]saltwort (mallows) among the bushes, And their food is the root of the broom shrub. 















###### 5 







"They are driven from the community; They shout after them as after a thief. 















###### 6 







"They must dwell on the slopes of [^b]wadis _And in_ holes in the ground and in rocks. 















###### 7 







"Among the bushes they cry out [like wild animals]; Beneath the prickly scrub they gather _and_ huddle together. 















###### 8 







"_They are the_ sons of [worthless and nameless] fools, They have been driven out of the land. 















###### 9 







"And now I have become [the subject of] their taunting; Yes, I am a [^c]byword _and_ a laughingstock to them. 















###### 10 







"They hate me, they stand aloof from me, And do not refrain from spitting in my face. 















###### 11 







"For God has loosed His bowstring [attacking me] and [He has] afflicted _and_ humbled me; They have cast off the bridle [of restraint] before me. 















###### 12 







"On my right the [rabble] brood rises; They push my feet away, and they build up their ways of destruction against me [like an advancing army]. 















###### 13 







"They break up _and_ clutter my path [upsetting my plans], They profit from my destruction; No one restrains them. 















###### 14 







"As _through_ a wide breach they come, Amid the crash [of falling walls] they roll on [over me]. 















###### 15 







"Terrors are turned upon me; They chase away my honor _and_ reputation like the wind, And my prosperity has passed away like a cloud. 















###### 16 







"And now my soul is poured out within me; The days of affliction have seized me. 















###### 17 







"My bones are pierced [with aching] in the night season, And _the pains_ that gnaw me take no rest. 















###### 18 







"By the great force [of my disease] my garment (skin) is disfigured _and_ blemished; It binds about me [choking me] like the collar of my coat. 















###### 19 







"God has cast me into the mire [a swampland of crisis], And I have become [worthless] like dust and ashes. 















###### 20 







"I cry to You for help, [Lord,] but You do not answer me; I stand up, but You [only] gaze [indifferently] at me. 















###### 21 







"You have become harsh _and_ cruel to me; With the might of Your hand You [keep me alive only to] persecute me. 















###### 22 







"You lift me up on the wind and cause me to ride [upon it]; And You toss me about in the tempest _and_ dissolve me in the storm. 















###### 23 







"For I know that You will bring me to death And to the house of meeting [appointed] for all the living. 















###### 24 







"However, does not one falling in a heap of ruins stretch out his hand? Or in his disaster [will he not] therefore cry out for help? 















###### 25 







"Did I not weep for one whose life was hard _and_ filled with trouble? Was not my heart grieved for the needy? 















###### 26 







"When I expected good, then came evil [to me]; And when I waited for light, then came darkness. 















###### 27 







"I am seething within _and_ my heart is troubled and cannot rest; Days of affliction come to meet me. 















###### 28 







"I go about mourning without comfort [my skin blackened by disease, not by the heat of the sun]; I stand up in the assembly _and_ cry out for help. 















###### 29 







"I am a brother to [howling] jackals, And a companion to ostriches [which scream dismally]. 















###### 30 







"My skin falls from me in blackened flakes, And my bones are burned with fever. 















###### 31 







"Therefore my lyre (harp) is _used_ for [the sound of] mourning, And my flute for the [sound of the] voices of those who weep. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

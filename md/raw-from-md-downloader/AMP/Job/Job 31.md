# Job 31

***
















###### 1 







"I have made a covenant (agreement) with my eyes; How then could I gaze [lustfully] at a virgin? 















###### 2 







"For what is the portion I would have from God above, And what heritage from the Almighty on high? 















###### 3 







"Does not tragedy fall [justly] on the unjust And disaster to those who work wickedness? 















###### 4 







"Does not God see my ways And count all my steps? 















###### 5 







"If I have walked with falsehood, Or if my foot has chased after deceit, 















###### 6 







Oh, let Him weigh me with accurate scales, And let God know my integrity. 















###### 7 







"If my step has turned away from the way [of God], Or if my heart has [covetously] followed my eyes, Or if any spot [of guilt] has stained my hands, 















###### 8 







Then let me plant and [let] another eat [from the results of my labor], And let my crops be uprooted _and_ ruined. 















###### 9 







"If my heart has been enticed _and_ I was made a fool by a woman, Or if I have [covetously] lurked at my neighbor's door [until his departure], 















###### 10 







Let my wife grind [meal, like a bond slave] for another [man], And let others [^a]kneel down over her. 















###### 11 







"For _adultery_ is a heinous _and_ lustful crime; Moreover, it would be a sin _punishable by_ the judges. 















###### 12 







"For it is a fire which consumes to Abaddon (destruction, ruin, final torment); And [illicit passion] would burn _and_ rage _and_ uproot all my [life's] increase [destroying everything]. 















###### 13 







"If I have despised _and_ rejected the claim of my male or female servants When they filed a complaint against me, 















###### 14 







What then could I do when God arises [to judge me]? When He calls me to account, what will I answer Him? 















###### 15 







"Did not He who made me in the womb make my servant, And did not the same One fashion us both in the womb? 















###### 16 







"If I have withheld from the poor what _they_ desired, Or have caused the eyes of the widow to look in vain [for relief], 















###### 17 







Or have eaten my morsel [of food] alone, And did not share it with the orphan 















###### 18 







**(**But from my youth the orphan grew up with me as with a father, And from my mother's womb I have been the widow's guide**)**, 















###### 19 







If I have seen anyone perish for lack of clothing, Or any poor person without covering, 















###### 20 







If his loins have not thanked _and_ blessed me [for clothing them], And if he was not warmed with the fleece of my sheep, 















###### 21 







If I have lifted my hand against the orphan, Because I saw [that the judges would be] my help at the [council] gate, 















###### 22 







Then let my shoulder fall away from its socket, And my arm be broken off at the elbow. 















###### 23 







"For tragedy from God is a terror to me, And because of His majesty _and_ exaltation I can do nothing [nor endure facing Him]. 















###### 24 







"If I have put my trust _and_ confidence in gold, Or have declared fine gold my hope _and_ assurance, 















###### 25 







If I gloated _and_ rejoiced because my wealth was great, And because my [powerful] hand [alone] had obtained so much, 















###### 26 







If I beheld the sun [as an object of worship] when it shone Or the moon going in its splendor, 















###### 27 







And my heart became secretly enticed [by them], And my hand threw a kiss from my mouth [in respect to them], 















###### 28 







This also would have been [a heinous] sin _calling for_ judgment, For I would have denied God above. 















###### 29 







"Have I rejoiced at the destruction of the enemy [who hated me], Or exulted [in malicious triumph] when evil overtook him? 















###### 30 







"No, I have not allowed my mouth to sin By cursing my enemy _and_ asking for his life. 















###### 31 







"I assure you, the men of my tent have said, 'Who can find one [in need] who has not been satisfied with his meat'? 















###### 32 







"The stranger has not lodged in the street, Because I have opened my door to the traveler. 















###### 33 







"Have I concealed my transgressions like Adam _or_ like other men, By hiding my wickedness in my bosom, 















###### 34 







Because I feared the great multitude, And the contempt of families terrified me, So that I kept silence _and_ did not acknowledge my sin and did not go out of the door? 















###### 35 







"Oh, that I had one to listen to me! Look, here is my signature (mark); Let the Almighty answer me! Let my adversary write out His indictment [and put His vague accusations in tangible form]. 















###### 36 







"Surely I would [proudly] bear it on my shoulder, And bind the scroll around my head like a crown. 















###### 37 







"I would count out to Him the number of my steps [with every detail of my life], Approaching His presence as _if I were_ a prince. 















###### 38 







"For if my land has cried out against me, And its furrows weep together; 















###### 39 







If I have eaten its fruits without paying for them, Or have caused its [rightful] owners to lose their lives, 















###### 40 







Let thorns grow instead of wheat, And stinkweed _and_ cockleburs instead of barley."

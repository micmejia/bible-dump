# Job 32

***
















###### 1 







So these three men ceased answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes [and could not be persuaded otherwise by them]. 















###### 2 







But Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became indignant. His indignation was kindled _and_ burned _and_ he became upset with Job because he justified himself rather than God [and even expressed doubts about God's character]. 















###### 3 







Elihu's anger burned against Job's three friends because they had found no answer [and were unable to determine Job's error], and yet they had condemned Job _and_ declared him to be in the wrong [and responsible for his own afflictions]. 















###### 4 







Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because the others were years older than he. 















###### 5 







And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouths of these three men, he burned with anger. 















###### 6 







Then Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite said, "I am young, and you are aged; For that reason I was anxious and dared not tell you what I think. 















###### 7 







"I thought age should speak, And a multitude of years should teach wisdom. 















###### 8 







"But there is [a vital force and] a spirit [of intelligence] in man, And the breath of the Almighty gives them understanding. 















###### 9 







"Those [who are] abundant _in years_ may not [always] be wise, Nor may the elders [always] understand justice. 















###### 10 







"Therefore I say, 'Listen to me; I also will give you my opinion [about Job's situation] _and_ tell you plainly what I think.' 















###### 11 







"You see, I waited for your words, I listened to your [wise] reasons, While you pondered _and_ searched out what to say. 















###### 12 







"I even paid close attention to [what] you [said], Indeed, not one of you convinced Job [nor could you refute him], Not one of you supplied [satisfactory] answers to his words. 















###### 13 







"Beware if you say, 'We have found wisdom; God thrusts Job down [justly], not man [for God alone is dealing with him].' 















###### 14 







"Now Job has not directed his words against me [therefore I have no reason to be offended], Nor will I answer him with arguments like yours. [I speak for truth, not for revenge.] 















###### 15 







"They (Job's friends) are dismayed _and_ embarrassed, they no longer answer; The words have moved away _and_ failed them," [says Elihu]. 















###### 16 







"And shall I wait, because they say nothing, But stand still and say no more? 















###### 17 







"I too will give my share of answers; I too will express my opinion _and_ share my knowledge. 















###### 18 







"For I am full of words; The spirit within me constrains me. 















###### 19 







"My belly is like unvented wine; Like new wineskins it is about to burst. 















###### 20 







"I must speak so that I may get relief; I will open my lips and answer. 















###### 21 







"I will not [I warn you] be partial to any man [that is, let my respect for you mitigate what I say]; Nor flatter any man. 















###### 22 







"For I do not know how to flatter, [in an appropriate way, and I fear that], My Maker would soon take me away. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

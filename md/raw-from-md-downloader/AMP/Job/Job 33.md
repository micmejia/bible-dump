# Job 33

***
















###### 1 







"However, Job, please listen to my words, And pay attention to everything I say. 















###### 2 







"Behold, I have opened my mouth [to begin my speech]; My tongue in my mouth is going to speak. 















###### 3 







"My words will express the uprightness of my heart, And my lips will speak what they know with utter sincerity. 















###### 4 







"The Spirit of God has made me, And the breath of [^a]the Almighty gives me life [which inspires me]. 















###### 5 







"Answer me, if you can; Set yourselves before me, take your stand. 















###### 6 







"Behold, I belong to God like you; I too was formed out of the clay. 















###### 7 







"Behold, I will not make you afraid or terrified of me [for I am only mortal and not God], Nor should any pressure from me weigh heavily upon you. 















###### 8 







"Surely you have spoken in my hearing, And I have heard the sound of your words, saying: 















###### 9 







'I am pure, without transgression; I am innocent and there is no guilt in me. 















###### 10 







'Behold, God finds pretexts against me; He counts me as His enemy. 















###### 11 







'He puts my feet in the stocks [to hinder and humiliate me]; He [suspiciously] watches all my paths,' [you say]. 















###### 12 







"Look, let me answer you, in this you are not right _or_ just; For God is greater _and_ far superior to man. 















###### 13 







"Why do you complain against Him? That He does not answer [you with] all His doings. 















###### 14 







"For God speaks once, And _even_ twice, yet no one notices it [including you, Job]. 















###### 15 







"In a dream, a vision of the night [one may hear God's voice], When deep sleep falls on men While slumbering upon the bed, 















###### 16 







Then He opens the ears of men And seals their instruction, 















###### 17 







That He may turn man aside _from his_ conduct, And keep him from pride; 















###### 18 







He holds back his soul from the pit [of destruction], And his life from passing over into Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead). 















###### 19 







"Man is also disciplined with pain on his bed, And with unceasing complaint in his bones, 















###### 20 







So that his life makes him loathe food, And his soul [loathe] even his favorite dishes. 















###### 21 







"His flesh is so wasted away that it cannot be seen, And his bones which were not seen now stick out. 















###### 22 







"Then his soul draws near to the pit [of destruction], And his life to those who bring death (the destroyers). 















###### 23 







"If there is an angel as a mediator for him, One out of a thousand, To explain to a man what is right for him [that is, how to be in right standing with God], 















###### 24 







Then [^b]the angel is gracious to him, and says, 'Spare him from going down to the pit [of destruction]; I have found a ransom [a consideration, or reason for redemption, an atonement]!' 















###### 25 







"Let his flesh be restored _and_ become fresher than in youth; Let him return to the days of his youthful strength. 















###### 26 







"He will pray to God, and He shall be favorable to him, So that he looks at His face with joy; For God restores to man His righteousness [that is, his right standing with God--with its joys]. 















###### 27 







"He sings out to other men, 'I have sinned and perverted that which was right, And it was not proper for me! 















###### 28 







'God has redeemed my life from going to the pit [of destruction], And my life shall see the light.'" 















###### 29 







[Elihu comments,] "Behold, God does all these _things_ [^c]twice, yes, three times, with a man, 















###### 30 







To bring his life back from the pit [of destruction], That he may be enlightened with the light of the living. 















###### 31 







"Pay attention, Job, listen to me; Keep silent, and I will speak. 















###### 32 







"If you have anything to say, answer me; Speak, for I desire to justify you. 















###### 33 







"If not [and you have nothing to say], listen to me; Keep silent, and I will teach you wisdom." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

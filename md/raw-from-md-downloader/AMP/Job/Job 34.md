# Job 34

***
















###### 1 







Elihu continued _his discourse_ and said, 















###### 2 







"Hear my words, you wise men, And listen to me, you who have [so much] knowledge. 















###### 3 







"For the ear puts words to the test As the palate tastes food. 















###### 4 







"Let us choose for ourselves that which is right; Let us know among ourselves what is good. 















###### 5 







"For Job has said, 'I am righteous [and innocent], But God has taken away my right; 















###### 6 







Although I am right, I am accounted a liar. My wound is incurable, _though I am_ without transgression.' 















###### 7 







"What man is like Job, Who drinks up derision like water, 















###### 8 







Who goes in company with those who do evil And walks with wicked men? 















###### 9 







"For he has said, 'It profits a man nothing When he takes delight _and_ is pleased with God _and_ obeys Him.' 















###### 10 







"Therefore hear me, you men of understanding. Far be it from God that He would do wickedness, And from the Almighty to do wrong. 















###### 11 







"For God pays a man according to his work, And He will make every man find [appropriate] _compensation_ according to his way. 















###### 12 







"Surely God will not act wickedly, Nor will the Almighty pervert justice. 















###### 13 







"Who put God in charge over the earth? And who has laid _on Him_ the whole world? 















###### 14 







"If God should determine to do so, If He should gather to Himself [that is, withdraw from man] His [life-giving] spirit and His breath, 















###### 15 







All flesh would perish together, And man would return to dust. 















###### 16 







"If _you now have_ understanding, hear this; Listen to the sound of my words. 















###### 17 







"Shall one who hates justice [and is an enemy of right] govern? And will you condemn Him who is just _and_ mighty? 















###### 18 







"God who says to a king, 'You are worthless _and_ vile,' Or to princes _and_ nobles, 'You are wicked _and_ evil'? 















###### 19 







"Who is not partial to princes, Nor does He regard the rich above the poor, For they all are the work of His hands. 















###### 20 







"In a moment they die, even at midnight The people are shaken and pass away, And the powerful are taken away without a [human] hand. 















###### 21 







"For God's eyes are on the ways of a man, And He sees all his steps. 















###### 22 







"There is no darkness nor deep shadow Where the evildoers may hide themselves. 















###### 23 







"For He sets no appointed time for a man, That he should appear before Him in judgment. 















###### 24 







"He breaks mighty men without inquiry, And sets others in their place. 















###### 25 







"Therefore He knows of their works, And He overthrows them in the night, So that they are crushed _and_ destroyed. 















###### 26 







"He strikes them like the wicked In a public place, 















###### 27 







Because they turned aside from following Him And would not consider _or_ show regard for any of His ways, 















###### 28 







So that they caused the cry of the poor to come to Him, And He heard the cry of the afflicted. 















###### 29 







"When He keeps quiet, who then can condemn? When He hides His face [withdrawing His favor and help], who then can behold Him [and make supplication to Him], Whether it be a nation or a man by himself?-- 















###### 30 







So that godless men would not rule Nor be snares for the people. 















###### 31 







"For has anyone said to God, 'I have endured _my chastisement_; I will not offend _anymore_; 















###### 32 







Teach me what I do not see [in regard to how I have sinned]; If I have done wrong (injustice, unrighteousness), I will not do it again'? 















###### 33 







"Shall God's retribution [for your sins] be on your terms, because you refuse to accept it? For you must do the choosing, and not I; Therefore say what you [truthfully] know. 















###### 34 







"Men of understanding will tell me, Indeed, every wise man who hears me [will agree], 















###### 35 







'Job speaks without knowledge, And his words are without wisdom _and_ insight. 















###### 36 







'Job ought to be tried [^a]to the limit Because he answers like wicked men! 















###### 37 







'For he adds rebellion [in his unsubmissive, defiant attitude toward God] to his [unacknowledged] sin; He claps his hands among us [in open mockery and contempt of God], And he multiplies his words [of accusation] against God.'" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Job 36

***
















###### 1 







Elihu continued and said, 















###### 2 







"Bear with me a little longer, and I will show you, That there is yet more to say on God's behalf. 















###### 3 







"I will bring my knowledge from afar, And will ascribe righteousness to my Maker. 















###### 4 







"For truly my words are not false; He who is perfect in knowledge is with you. 















###### 5 







"Behold, God is mighty, and yet does not despise _anyone_ [nor regard any as trivial]; _He is_ mighty in the strength _and_ power of understanding. 















###### 6 







"He does not prolong the life of the wicked, But gives the afflicted their justice. 















###### 7 







"He does not withdraw His eyes from the righteous [those in right standing with Him]; But with kings upon the throne He has seated them forever, and they are exalted. 















###### 8 







"And if they are bound in bonds [of adversity], And held by cords of affliction, 















###### 9 







Then He declares to them [the true character of] their deeds And their transgressions, that they have acted arrogantly [with presumption and notions of self-sufficiency]. 















###### 10 







"He opens their ears to instruction _and_ discipline, And commands that they return from evil. 















###### 11 







"If they hear and serve _Him_, They will end their days in prosperity And their years in pleasantness _and_ joy. 















###### 12 







"But if they do not hear _and_ obey, they will die by the sword [of God's destructive judgments] And they will die [in ignorance] without [true] knowledge. 















###### 13 







"But the godless in heart store up anger [at the divine discipline]; They do not cry [to Him] for help when He binds them [with cords of affliction]. 















###### 14 







"They die in youth, And their life _ends_ among the [^a]cult prostitutes. 















###### 15 







"He rescues the afflicted in their affliction, And opens their ears [so that they pay attention to His voice] in _times of_ oppression. 















###### 16 







"Then indeed, He enticed you from the mouth of distress _and_ confinement, Into a broad place where there is no constraint _or_ distress; And that which was set on your table was full of fatness (rich food). 















###### 17 







"But you [Job] were full of judgment on the wicked, Judgment and justice take hold _of you_. 















###### 18 







"Do not let wrath entice you into scoffing; And do not let the greatness _and_ the extent of the ransom turn you aside. 















###### 19 







"Will your wealth [be sufficient to] keep you from [the confinement of] distress, Or will all the force of your strength do it? 















###### 20 







"Do not long for the night, When people vanish from their places. 















###### 21 







"Take heed _and_ be careful, do not turn to wickedness, For you have chosen this [the vice of complaining against God] rather than [learning from] affliction. 















###### 22 







"Behold, God is exalted in His power; Who is a ruler _or_ a teacher like Him? 















###### 23 







"Who has appointed God His way, And who can say [to Him], 'You have done wrong'? 















###### 24 







"Remember that you should magnify God's work, Of which men have sung. 















###### 25 







"All men have seen God's work; Man looks at it from a distance. 















###### 26 







"Behold, God is exalted, and we do not know _Him_; The number of His years is unsearchable. 















###### 27 







"For He draws up the drops of water, They distill rain from the mist, 















###### 28 







Which the clouds pour down, They drop abundantly upon mankind." 















###### 29 







"Can anyone understand the spreading of the clouds Or the thundering of His pavilion? 















###### 30 







"Behold, He spreads His lightning around Him [against the dark clouds], And He covers the depths of the sea. 















###### 31 







"For by these [mighty acts] He judges the peoples; He gives food in abundance. 















###### 32 







"He covers _His_ hands with the lightning, And commands it to strike the mark. 















###### 33 







"His thundering voice declares [awesomely] His presence; The cattle also are told of His coming storm. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

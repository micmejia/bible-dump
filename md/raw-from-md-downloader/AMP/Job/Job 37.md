# Job 37

***
















###### 1 







"Indeed, at _His_ thundering my heart trembles And leaps out of its place. 















###### 2 







"Listen carefully to the thunder of His voice, And the rumbling that goes out of His mouth! 















###### 3 







"He lets it loose under the whole heaven, And His lightning to the ends of the earth. 















###### 4 







"After it, His voice roars; He thunders with the voice of His majesty, And He does not restrain His lightning [against His adversaries] when His voice is heard. 















###### 5 







"God thunders marvelously with His voice; He does great things which we cannot comprehend. 















###### 6 







"For He says to the snow, 'Fall on the earth'; And [He speaks] to the showers and to the downpour [of His mighty rains], 'Be strong.' 















###### 7 







"God seals (brings to a standstill, stops) [by severe weather] the hand of every man, That all men [whom He has made] may know His work [that is, His sovereign power and their subjection to it]. 















###### 8 







"Then the beast goes into its lair And remains in its hiding place. 















###### 9 







"Out of its chamber comes the storm, And cold from the north wind. 















###### 10 







"Ice is made by the breath of God, And the expanse of the waters is frozen. 















###### 11 







"He loads the thick cloud with moisture; He disperses the cloud of His lightning. 















###### 12 







"Its direction is turned around by His guidance, That it may do whatever He commands it On the face of the inhabited earth. 















###### 13 







"Whether [it be] for correction, or for His earth [generally] Or for [His] mercy _and_ lovingkindness, He causes it to happen. 















###### 14 







"Listen to this, Job; Stand still and consider the wonders of God. 















###### 15 







"Do you know how God establishes _and_ commands them, And makes the lightning of His [storm] cloud shine? 















###### 16 







"Do you know about the layers of thick clouds [and how they are balanced and poised in the heavens], The wonderful works of Him who is perfect in knowledge, 















###### 17 







You whose garments are hot, When He quiets the earth [in sultry summer] with the [oppressive] south wind? 















###### 18 







"Can you, with Him, spread out the sky, Strong as a molten mirror? 















###### 19 







"Tell us [Job] what words [of man] shall we say to such a Being; We cannot state _our case_ because of darkness [that is, our ignorance in the presence of the unsearchable God]. 















###### 20 







"So shall it be told Him that I wish to speak? Or should a man say that he would be swallowed up [and destroyed by God]? 















###### 21 







"Now people cannot look at the light when it is bright in the skies [without being blinded], When the wind has passed and cleared them. 















###### 22 







"Out of the north comes golden _splendor_ [and people can hardly look on it]; Around God is awesome splendor _and_ majesty [far too glorious for man's eyes]. 















###### 23 







"The Almighty--we cannot find Him; He is exalted in power And He will not do violence to [nor disregard] justice and abundant righteousness. 















###### 24 







"Men therefore fear Him; He does not regard _nor_ respect any who are wise in heart [in their own understanding and conceit]." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

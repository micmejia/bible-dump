# Job 39

***
















###### 1 







"Do you know the time when the wild goats of the rock give birth [to their young]? Do you observe the calving of the deer? 















###### 2 







"Can you count the months that they [^a]carry offspring, Or do you know the time when they give birth? 















###### 3 







"They kneel down, they bring forth their young, They cast out their labor pains. 















###### 4 







"Their young ones become strong, they grow up in the open field; They leave and do not return to them. 















###### 5 







"Who sent out the wild donkey free [from dependence on man]? And who has loosed the bonds of the wild donkey [to survive in the wild], 















###### 6 







To whom I gave the wilderness as his home And the salt land as his dwelling place? 















###### 7 







"He scorns the tumult of the city, And does not hear the shouting of the taskmaster. 















###### 8 







"He explores the mountains as his pasture And searches after every green thing. 















###### 9 







"Will the wild ox be willing to serve you, Or remain beside your manger at night? 















###### 10 







"Can you bind the wild ox with a harness [to the plow] in the furrow? Or will he plow the valleys for you? 















###### 11 







"Will you trust him because his strength is great And leave your labor to him? 















###### 12 







"Will you have faith _and_ depend on him to return your grain And gather it from your threshing floor? 















###### 13 







"The [flightless] wings of the ostrich wave joyously; With the pinion (shackles, fetters) and plumage of love, 















###### 14 







For she leaves her eggs on the ground And warms them in the dust, 















###### 15 







Forgetting that a foot may crush them, Or that the wild beast may trample them. 















###### 16 







"She treats her young cruelly, as if they were not hers; Though her labor is in vain because she is unconcerned [for the safety of her brood], 















###### 17 







For God has made her forget wisdom, And has not given her a share of understanding. 















###### 18 







"Yet when she lifts herself [^b]on high, [So swift is she that] she laughs at the horse and his rider. 















###### 19 







"Have you given the horse his might? Have you clothed his neck with quivering _and_ a shaking mane? 















###### 20 







"Have you [Job] made him leap like a locust? The majesty of his snorting [nostrils] is terrible. 















###### 21 







"He paws in the valley and rejoices in his strength; He goes out to meet the weapons [of armed men]. 















###### 22 







"He laughs at fear and is not dismayed; And [in battle] he does not turn back from the sword. 















###### 23 







"The quiver rattles against him, [As do] the flashing spear and the lance [of his rider]. 















###### 24 







"With fierceness and rage he races to devour the ground, And he does not stand still at the sound of the [war] trumpet. 















###### 25 







"As often as the trumpet sounds he says, 'Aha!' And he smells the battle from far away, And _senses_ the thunder of the captains and the war cry. 















###### 26 







"Is it by your understanding that the hawk soars, Stretching his wings toward the south [as winter approaches]? 















###### 27 







"Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up And makes his nest on high [in an inaccessible place]? 















###### 28 







"On the cliff he dwells and remains [securely], Upon the point of the rock and the inaccessible stronghold. 















###### 29 







"From there he spies out the prey; His eyes see it from far away. 















###### 30

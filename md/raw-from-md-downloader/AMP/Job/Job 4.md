# Job 4

***
















###### 1 







Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, 















###### 2 







"If we dare to converse with you, will you be impatient [or offended]? But who can restrain himself from speaking? 















###### 3 







"Behold, you have admonished _and_ instructed many, And you have strengthened weak hands. 















###### 4 







"Your words have helped the one who was stumbling to stand, And you have strengthened feeble knees. 















###### 5 







"But now [^a]adversity comes upon you, and you are impatient _and_ intolerant; It touches you, and you are horrified. 















###### 6 







"Is not your fear _of God_ your confidence, And [is not] the integrity _and_ uprightness of your ways your hope? 















###### 7 







"Remember now, who, being innocent, ever perished? Or where [and in what circumstances] were those upright _and_ in right standing with God destroyed? 















###### 8 







"As I have seen, those who plow wickedness And those who sow trouble _and_ harm harvest it. 















###### 9 







"By the breath of God they perish, And by the blast of His anger they are consumed. 















###### 10 







"The roaring of the lion and the voice of the _fierce_ lion, And the teeth of the young lions are broken. 















###### 11 







"The lion perishes for lack of prey, And the cubs of the lioness are scattered. 















###### 12 







"Now a word was secretly brought to me, And my ear received a whisper of it. 















###### 13 







"Amid disquieting thoughts from the visions of the night, When deep sleep falls on men, 















###### 14 







Dread and trembling came upon me, Which made all my bones shake. 















###### 15 







"Then a spirit passed before my face; The hair on my skin stood on end! 















###### 16 







"The spirit stood still, but I could not discern its appearance; A form was before my eyes; _There was_ silence, and then I heard a voice, saying: 















###### 17 







'Can [mortal] man be just before God _or_ be more righteous than He? Can a man be pure before his Maker _or_ be more cleansed than He? 















###### 18 







'God puts no trust _or_ confidence, even in His [heavenly] servants, And He charges His angels with error. 















###### 19 







'How much more [will He blame and charge] those who dwell in houses (bodies) of clay, Whose foundations are in the dust, Who are crushed like a moth. 















###### 20 







'Between morning and evening they are broken in pieces _and_ destroyed; Unobserved _and_ unnoticed, they perish forever. 















###### 21 







'Is not their tent-cord drawn up within them [so that the tent collapses]? Do they not die, and yet without [acquiring] wisdom?' ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Job 40

***
















###### 1 







Then the LORD said to Job, 















###### 2 







"Will the faultfinder contend with the Almighty? Let him who disputes with God answer it." 















###### 3 







Then Job replied to the LORD and said, 















###### 4 







"Behold, I am of little importance _and_ contemptible; what can I reply to You? I lay my hand on my mouth. 















###### 5 







"I have spoken once, but I will not reply again-- Indeed, twice [I have answered], and I will add nothing further." ## God Questions Job 















###### 6 







Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, saying, 















###### 7 







"Now [^a]gird up your loins (prepare yourself) like a man, And I will ask you, and you instruct Me. 















###### 8 







"Will you really annul My judgment _and_ set it aside as void? Will you condemn Me [your God] that you may [appear to] be righteous _and_ justified? 















###### 9 







"Have you an arm like God, And can you thunder with a voice like His? 















###### 10 







"Adorn yourself with eminence and dignity [since you question the Almighty], And array yourself with honor and majesty. 















###### 11 







"Pour out the overflowings of your wrath, And look at everyone who is proud and make him low. 















###### 12 







Look at everyone who is proud, and humble him, And [if you are so able] tread down the wicked where they stand. 















###### 13 







"[Crush and] hide them in the dust together; Shut them up in the hidden place [the house of death]. 















###### 14 







"[If you can do all this, Job, proving your divine power] then I [God] will also praise you _and_ acknowledge That your own right hand can save you. ## God's Power Shown in Creatures 















###### 15 







"Behold now, [^b]Behemoth, which I created as well as you; He eats grass like an ox. 















###### 16 







"See now, his strength is in his loins And his power is in the muscles _and_ sinews of his belly. 















###### 17 







"He sways his tail like a cedar; The tendons of his thighs are twisted _and_ knit together [like a rope]. 















###### 18 







"His bones are tubes of bronze; His [^c]limbs are like bars of iron. 















###### 19 







"He is the first [in magnitude and power] of the works of God; [Only] He who made him can bring near His sword [to master him]. 















###### 20 







"Surely the mountains bring him food, And all the wild animals play there. 















###### 21 







"He lies down under the lotus plants, In the hidden shelter of the reeds in the marsh. 















###### 22 







"The lotus plants cover him with their shade; The willows of the brook surround him. 















###### 23 







"If a river rages _and_ overflows, he does not tremble; He is confident, though the Jordan [River] swells and rushes against his mouth. 















###### 24 







"Can anyone capture him when he is on watch, Or pierce his nose with barbs [to trap him]? ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

In Jobâ€™s day the hippopotamus was the largest known creature, was commonly found in the lower Nile River, and may also have existed in the Jordan. [^c]: Job 40:18 Lit _bones_.

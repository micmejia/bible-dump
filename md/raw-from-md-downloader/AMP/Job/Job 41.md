# Job 41

***
















###### 1 







"[^a]Can you draw out [^b]Leviathan with a fishhook? Or press down his tongue with a cord? 















###### 2 







"Can you put a rope [made] of rushes into his nose Or pierce his jaw through with a hook? 















###### 3 







"Will he make many supplications to you [begging to be spared]? Or will he speak soft words to you [to coax you to treat him kindly]? 















###### 4 







"Will he make a covenant _or_ an arrangement with you? Will you take him for your servant forever? 















###### 5 







"Will you play with him as with a bird? Or will you bind him [and put him on a leash] for your maidens? 















###### 6 







"Will traders bargain over him? Will they divide him up among the merchants? 















###### 7 







"Can you fill his skin with harpoons, Or his head with fishing spears? 















###### 8 







"Lay your hand on him; Remember the battle [with him]; you will not do such [an ill-advised thing] again! 















###### 9 







"[^c]Behold, his [assailant's] hope _and_ expectation [of defeating Leviathan] is false; Will not one be overwhelmed even at the sight of him? 















###### 10 







"No one is so fierce [and foolhardy] that he dares to stir up Leviathan; Who then is he who can stand before Me [or dares to contend with Me, the beast's creator]? 















###### 11 







"Who has first given to Me that I should repay him? Whatever is under the whole heaven is Mine. [Who can have a claim against Me who made the unmastered beast?] 















###### 12 







"I will not keep silence concerning his limbs, Nor his mighty strength, nor his orderly frame. 















###### 13 







"Who can penetrate _or_ strip off his outer armor? Who can come to his jaws with a double bridle? 















###### 14 







"Who can open the doors (jaws) of his face? Around his [open jaws and] teeth there is terror. 















###### 15 







"His strong scales are his pride, Bound together as with a tight seal. 















###### 16 







"One is so near to another That no air can come between them. 















###### 17 







"They are joined one to another; They stick together and cannot be separated. 















###### 18 







"His sneezes flash forth light, And his eyes are like the [reddish] eyelids of the dawn. 















###### 19 







"Out of his mouth go burning torches, And sparks of fire leap out. 















###### 20 







"Out of his nostrils smoke goes forth As from a boiling pot and [as from] _burning_ rushes. 















###### 21 







"His breath kindles coals, And a flame goes forth from his mouth. 















###### 22 







"In Leviathan's neck resides strength, And dismay _and_ terror dance before him. 















###### 23 







"The folds of his flesh are joined together, Firm on him and immobile [when he moves]. 















###### 24 







"His heart is as hard as a stone, Indeed, as solid as a lower millstone. 















###### 25 







"When he raises himself up, the mighty are afraid; Because of the crashing they are bewildered. 















###### 26 







"The sword that reaches him cannot avail, Nor [does] the spear, the dart, or the javelin. 















###### 27 







"He considers iron as straw, Bronze as rotten wood. 















###### 28 







"The arrow cannot make him flee; Slingstones are treated as stubble by him. 















###### 29 







"Clubs [also] are regarded as stubble; He laughs at the rushing _and_ the rattling of the javelin. 















###### 30 







"His underparts are like sharp pieces of broken pottery; He moves across _and_ spreads out [grooves] like a threshing sledge on the mire (muddy river banks). 















###### 31 







"He makes the deep water boil like a pot; He makes the sea like a [foaming] pot of ointment. 















###### 32 







"Behind him he makes a shining wake; One would think the deep to be gray-haired [with foam]. 















###### 33 







"Upon earth there is nothing like him--no equal exists, A creature made without fear. 















###### 34 







"He looks on everything that is high [without terror]; He is monarch over all the sons of pride. [And now, Job, [^d]who are you who does not dare to disturb the beast, yet who dares resist Me, the beast's creator? Everything under the heavens is Mine; therefore, who can have a claim against God?]" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

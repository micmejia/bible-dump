# Job 42

***
















###### 1 







Then Job answered the LORD and said, 















###### 2 







"I know that You can do all things, And that no thought _or_ purpose of Yours can be restrained. 















###### 3 







"[You said to me] 'Who is this that darkens _and_ obscures counsel [by words] without knowledge?' Therefore [I now see] I have [rashly] uttered that which I did not understand, Things too wonderful for me, which I did not know. 















###### 4 







'Hear, please, and I will speak; I will ask You, and You instruct [and answer] me.' 















###### 5 







"I had heard of You [only] by the hearing of the ear, But now my [spiritual] eye sees You. 















###### 6 







"Therefore I retract [my words and hate myself] And I repent in dust and ashes." ## God Displeased with Job's Friends 















###### 7 







It came about that after the LORD had spoken these words to Job, that the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, "My wrath is kindled against you and against your two friends, for you have not spoken of Me what is right, as My servant Job has. 















###### 8 







Now therefore, take for yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, and go to My servant Job, and offer up a burnt offering for yourselves, and My servant Job will pray for you. For I will accept him [and his prayer] so that I may not deal with you _according to your_ folly, because you have not spoken of Me the thing that is right, as My servant Job has." 















###### 9 







So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did as the LORD told them; and the LORD accepted Job's prayer. ## God Restores Job's Fortunes 















###### 10 







The LORD restored the fortunes of Job when he prayed for his friends, and the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before. 















###### 11 







Then all his brothers and sisters and all who had known him before came to him, and they ate bread with him in his house; and they consoled him and comforted him over all the [distressing] adversities that the LORD had brought on him. And each one gave him a piece of money, and each a ring of gold. 















###### 12 







And the LORD blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning; for he had 14,000 sheep, 6,000 camels, 1,000 yoke of oxen, and 1,000 female donkeys. 















###### 13 







He had seven sons and three daughters. 















###### 14 







And he called the name of the first [daughter] Jemimah, and the name of the second Keziah, and the name of the third Keren-happuch. 















###### 15 







In all the land there were found no women so fair as the daughters of Job; and their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers. 















###### 16 







After this, Job lived 140 years, and saw his sons and his grandsons, four generations. 















###### 17 







So Job died, an old man and full of days. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

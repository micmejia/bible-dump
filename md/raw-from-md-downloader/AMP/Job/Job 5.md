# Job 5

***
















###### 1 







"Call now --is there anyone who will answer you? And to which of the holy ones (angels) will you turn? 















###### 2 







"For anger slays the foolish man, And jealousy kills the simple (naive). 















###### 3 







"I have seen the foolish taking root [and outwardly prospering], But I cursed his dwelling immediately [for his destruction was certain]. 















###### 4 







"His children are far from safety [and included in their father's ruin], They are oppressed _and_ crushed in the [court of justice in the city's] gate, And there is no [^a]one to rescue _them_. 















###### 5 







"The hungry devour his harvest And take it even [when it grows] among the thorns; The trap opens for [his] wealth. 















###### 6 







"For affliction does not come forth from the dust, Nor does trouble spring forth from the ground. 















###### 7 







"For man is born for trouble, [As naturally] as sparks fly upward. 















###### 8 







"As for me, I would seek God _and_ inquire of Him, And I would commit my cause to God; 















###### 9 







Who does great and unsearchable things, Marvelous things without number. 















###### 10 







"He gives rain upon the earth And sends waters upon the fields, 















###### 11 







So that He sets on high those who are lowly, And He lifts to safety those who mourn. 















###### 12 







"He frustrates the devices _and_ schemes of the crafty, So that their hands cannot attain success _or_ achieve anything of [lasting] worth. 















###### 13 







"He catches the [so-called] wise in their own shrewdness, And the advice of the devious is quickly thwarted. 















###### 14 







"In the daytime they meet in darkness, And at noon they grope as in the night. 















###### 15 







"But God saves [the innocent] from the sword of the mouth of the devious, And the poor from the hand of the mighty. 















###### 16 







"So the helpless have hope, And injustice shuts its mouth. 















###### 17 







"Behold, how happy _and_ fortunate is the man whom God reproves, So do not despise _or_ reject the discipline of the Almighty [subjecting you to trial and suffering]. 















###### 18 







"For He inflicts pain, but He binds up _and_ gives relief; He wounds, but His hands also heal. 















###### 19 







"He will rescue you from six troubles; Even in seven, evil will not touch you. 















###### 20 







"In famine He will redeem you from death, And in war from the power of the sword. 















###### 21 







"You will be hidden from the scourge of the tongue, And you will not be afraid of destruction when it comes. 















###### 22 







"You will laugh at violence and famine, And you will not be afraid of the wild beasts of the earth. 















###### 23 







"For you will be in harmony with the stones of the field, And the beasts of the field will be at peace with you. 















###### 24 







"You will know also that your tent is secure _and_ at peace, And you will visit your dwelling and fear no loss [nor find anything amiss]. 















###### 25 







"You will know also that your descendants will be many, And your offspring as the grass of the earth. 















###### 26 







"You will come to your grave in old age, Like the stacking of grain [on the threshing floor] in its season. 















###### 27

Hear _and_ heed it, and know for yourself [for your own good]." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Job 6

***
















###### 1 







Then Job answered and said, 















###### 2 







"Oh, that my grief could actually be weighed And placed in the balances together with my tragedy [to see if my grief is the grief of a coward]! 















###### 3 







"For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea; Therefore my words have been incoherent, 















###### 4 







Because the arrows of the Almighty are within me, My spirit drinks their poison; The terrors of God are arrayed against me. 















###### 5 







"Does the wild donkey bray when he has grass? Or does the ox low over his fodder? 















###### 6 







"Can something that has no taste to it be eaten without salt? Or is there any flavor in the white of an egg? 















###### 7 







"My soul refuses to touch them; Such things are like loathsome food to me [sickening and repugnant]. 















###### 8 







"Oh that my request would come to pass, And that God would grant me the thing that I long for! 















###### 9 







"I wish that it would please God to crush me, That He would let loose His hand and cut me off. 















###### 10 







"Then I would still have consolation, And I would jump for joy amid unsparing pain, That I have not denied _or_ hidden the words of the Holy One. 















###### 11 







"What strength do I have left, that I should wait [and hope]? And what is ahead of me, that I should be patient _and_ endure? 















###### 12 







"Is my strength _and_ endurance that of stones, Or is my flesh made of bronze? 















###### 13 







"Is it that I have no help within myself, And that success _and_ wisdom have been driven from me? 















###### 14 







"For the despairing man _there should be_ kindness from his friend; So that he does not [^a]abandon (turn away from) the fear of the Almighty. 















###### 15 







"My brothers have acted deceitfully like a brook, Like the torrents of brooks that vanish, 















###### 16 







Which are dull _and_ dirty because of ice, And into which the snow melts _and_ hides itself; 















###### 17 







When it is warm, they are silent _and_ cease to flow; When it is hot, they vanish from their place. 















###### 18 







"The paths of their course wind along, They go up into nothing _and_ perish. [Your counsel is as helpful to me as a dry streambed in the heat of summer.] 















###### 19 







"The caravans of [^b]Tema looked [for water], The caravans of [^c]Sheba waited for them [in vain]. 















###### 20 







"They were put to shame _and_ disappointed because they had trusted [that they would find water]; They came there and were ashamed. 















###### 21 







"Indeed, you have now become like a dried-up stream, You see a terror [believing me to be a victim of the wrath of God] and are afraid [to be compassionate]. 















###### 22 







"Did I ever say, 'Give me _something_,' Or, 'Pay a bribe for me from your wealth,' 















###### 23 







Or, 'Rescue me from the adversary's hand,' Or, 'Redeem me from the hand of the tyrants'? 















###### 24 







"Teach me, and I will be silent; And show me how I have erred. 















###### 25 







"How painful are words of honesty. But what does your argument prove? 















###### 26 







"Do you intend to reprove my words [with a convincing argument], When the words of one in despair belong to the wind [and go ignored]? 















###### 27 







"You would cast _lots_ (gamble) over the fatherless And bargain away your friend. 















###### 28 







"Now please look at me, And _see_ if I lie to your face [for you know that I would not]. 















###### 29 







"Turn away [from your suspicion], let there be no injustice; Turn away, my righteousness _and_ vindication is still in it. 















###### 30 







"Is there injustice _or_ malice on my tongue? Can my palate not discern what is destructive? ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Job 7

***
















###### 1 







"Is not man forced to labor on earth? And are not his days like the days of a hired man? 















###### 2 







"As a slave earnestly longs for the shade, And as a hired man eagerly awaits his wages, 















###### 3 







So am I allotted months of futility _and_ suffering, And [long] nights of trouble _and_ misery are appointed to me. 















###### 4 







"When I lie down I say, 'When shall I arise [and the night be gone]?' But the night continues, And I am continually tossing until the dawning of day. 















###### 5 







"My body is clothed with worms and a crust of dust; My skin is hardened [and broken and loathsome], and [breaks out and] runs. 















###### 6 







"My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, And are spent without hope. 















###### 7 







"Remember that my life is but breath [a puff of wind, a sigh]; My eye will not see good again. 















###### 8 







"The eye of him who sees me [now] will see me no more; Your eyes _will be_ upon me, but I will not be. 















###### 9 







"As a cloud vanishes and is gone, So he who goes down to Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead) does not come up. 















###### 10 







"He will not return again to his house, Nor will his place know about him anymore. 















###### 11 







"Therefore I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit, I will complain in the bitterness of my soul [O Lord]. 















###### 12 







"Am I the sea, or the sea monster, That You set a guard over me? 















###### 13 







"When I say, 'My bed will comfort me, My couch will ease my complaint,' 















###### 14 







Then You frighten me with dreams And terrify me through visions, 















###### 15 







So that I would choose suffocation, Death rather than my [^a]pain. 















###### 16 







"I waste away _and_ loathe my life; I will not live forever. Let me alone, for my days are but a breath [futile and without substance]. 















###### 17 







"What is man that You [should] magnify him [and think him important]? And that You are concerned about him? 















###### 18 







"And that You examine him every morning And try _and_ test him every moment? 















###### 19 







"Will You never turn Your gaze away from me [it plagues me], Nor let me alone until I swallow my spittle? 















###### 20 







"If I have sinned, what [harm] have I done to You, O Watcher of mankind? Why have You set me as a target for You, So that I am a burden to myself? 















###### 21 







"Why then do You not pardon my transgression And take away my sin _and_ guilt? For now I will lie down in the dust; And You will seek me [diligently], but I will not be." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

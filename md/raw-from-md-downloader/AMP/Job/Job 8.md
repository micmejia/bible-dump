# Job 8

***
















###### 1 







Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said, 















###### 2 







"How long will you say these things? And will the words of your mouth be a mighty wind? 















###### 3 







"Does God pervert justice? Or does [^a]the Almighty pervert righteousness? 















###### 4 







"If your children have sinned against Him, Then He has handed them over to the power of their transgression _and_ punished them. 















###### 5 







"If you would [diligently] seek God And implore the compassion _and_ favor of the Almighty, 















###### 6 







Then, if you are pure and upright, Surely now He will awaken for you And restore your righteous place. 















###### 7 







"Though your beginning was insignificant, Yet your end will greatly increase. 















###### 8 







"Inquire, please, of past generations, And consider _and_ apply yourself to the things searched out by their fathers. 















###### 9 







"For we are _only_ of yesterday and know nothing, Because our days on earth are [like] a shadow [just a breath or a vapor]. 















###### 10 







"Will they (the fathers) not teach you _and_ tell you, And utter words from their hearts [the deepest part of their nature]? 















###### 11 







"Can the papyrus grow up without a marsh? Can the rushes _or_ reed grass grow without water? 















###### 12 







"While it is still green (in flower) and not cut down, Yet it withers before any _other_ plant [when without water]. 















###### 13 







"So are the paths of all who forget God; And the hope of the godless will perish, 















###### 14 







For his confidence is fragile _and_ breaks, And his trust is [like] a spider's web. 















###### 15 







"He trusts in his house, but it does not stand; He holds tightly to it, but it does not endure. 















###### 16 







"He thrives _and_ prospers [like a green plant] before the sun, And his branches spread out over his garden. 















###### 17 







"His [godless] roots are wrapped around a pile of rocks, And he gazes at a house of stones. 















###### 18 







"If he is snatched from his place [in the garden], Then his place will forget him, _saying_, 'I have never seen you.' 















###### 19 







"Behold, this is the joy of His way; And from out of the dust others will spring up _and_ grow [to take his place]. 















###### 20 







"Behold, God will not reject a _man of_ integrity, Nor will He strengthen _or_ support evildoers. 















###### 21 







"He will yet fill your mouth with laughter And your lips with joyful shouting [if you are found blameless]. 















###### 22

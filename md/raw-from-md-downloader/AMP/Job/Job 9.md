# Job 9

***
















###### 1 







Then Job answered and said, 















###### 2 







"Yes, I know it is true. But how can a mortal man be right before God? 















###### 3 







"If one should want to contend _or_ dispute with Him, He could not answer Him once in a thousand _times_. 















###### 4 







"_God_ is wise in heart and mighty in strength; Who has [ever] defied _or_ challenged Him and remained unharmed? 















###### 5 







"_It is God_ who removes the mountains, and they do not know it, When He overturns them in His anger; 















###### 6 







Who shakes the earth out of its place, And its pillars tremble; 















###### 7 







Who commands the sun, and it does not shine; Who seals up the stars [from view]; 















###### 8 







Who alone stretches out the heavens And tramples down the [^a]waves of the sea; 















###### 9 







Who made [the constellations] the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, And the [vast starry] spaces of the south; 















###### 10 







Who does great things, [beyond understanding,] unfathomable, Yes, marvelous _and_ wondrous things without number. 















###### 11 







"Behold, He passes by me, and I do not see Him; He moves past me, but I do not perceive Him. 















###### 12 







"Behold, He snatches away; who can restrain _or_ turn Him back? Who will say to Him, 'What are You doing?' 















###### 13 







"God will not turn back His anger; The [proud] helpers of Rahab [the arrogant monster of the sea] bow under Him. 















###### 14 







"How can I answer Him [and plead my case], Choosing my words [to reason] with Him? 















###### 15 







For though I were righteous, I could not answer. I must appeal for mercy to my Opponent _and_ Judge. 















###### 16 







"If I called and He answered me, I could not believe that He was listening to my voice. 















###### 17 







"For He bruises me with a tempest And multiplies my wounds without cause. 















###### 18 







"He will not allow me to catch my breath, But fills _and_ saturates me with bitterness. 















###### 19 







"If it is a matter of strength _and_ power, behold, _He is_ mighty! And if of justice, who can summon _and_ challenge Him? 















###### 20 







"Though I am innocent _and_ in the right, my own mouth would pronounce me guilty; Though I am blameless, He would denounce me as guilty. 















###### 21 







"[Though] I am blameless, I do not care about myself; I despise my life. 















###### 22 







"It is _all_ one; therefore I say, 'He destroys [both] the blameless and the wicked.' 















###### 23 







"When [His] scourge kills suddenly, He mocks at the despair of the innocent. 















###### 24 







"The earth is given into the hands of the wicked; He covers the faces of its judges [so that they are blind to justice]. If it is not He, then who is it [that is responsible for all this injustice]? 















###### 25 







"Now my days are swifter than a runner; They vanish, they see no good. 















###### 26 







"They pass by like the [swift] boats made of reeds, Like an eagle that swoops down on its prey. 















###### 27 







"If I say, 'I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my sad appearance, and be cheerful _and_ brighten up,' 















###### 28 







I am afraid of all my pains _and_ worries [yet to come]; I know that You will not acquit me _and_ leave me unpunished. 















###### 29 







"I am accounted wicked _and_ held guilty; Why then should I labor in vain [to appear innocent]? 















###### 30 







"If I were to wash myself with snow And cleanse my hands with lye, 















###### 31 







You would still plunge me into the pit, And my own clothes would hate me [and refuse to cover my foul body]. 















###### 32 







"For God is not a [mere] man, as I am, that I may answer Him, That we may go to court _and_ judgment together. 















###### 33 







"There is no arbitrator between us, Who could lay his hand upon us both [would that there were]. 















###### 34 







"Let Him take His rod away from me, And let not the dread _and_ fear of Him terrify me. 















###### 35 







"_Then_ I would speak [my defense] and not fear Him; But I am not like that in myself. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

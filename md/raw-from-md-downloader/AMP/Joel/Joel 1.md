# Joel 1

***
















###### 1 







The word of the LORD that came to [^a]Joel, the son of Pethuel. ## The Devastation of Locusts 















###### 2 







Hear this, O elders, Listen closely, all inhabitants of the land! Has _such a thing as_ this occurred in your days, Or even in the days of your fathers? 















###### 3 







Tell your children about it, And let your children tell their children, And their children the next generation. 















###### 4 







What the gnawing locust has left, the swarming locust has eaten; And what the swarming locust has left, the creeping locust has eaten; And what the creeping locust has left, the stripping locust has eaten [in judgment of Judah]. 















###### 5 







Awake [from your intoxication], you drunkards, and weep; Wail, all you drinkers of wine, Because of the [fresh] sweet wine That is cut off from your mouth. 















###### 6 







For a [pagan and hostile] nation has invaded My land [like locusts], Mighty and without number; Its teeth are the teeth of a lion, And it has the fangs of a lioness. 















###### 7 







It has made My vine (My people) a waste _and_ object of horror, And splintered _and_ broken My fig tree. It has stripped them completely bare and thrown them away; Their branches have become white. 















###### 8 







Wail like a virgin [bride] clothed with [^b]sackcloth For the bridegroom of her youth [who has died]. 















###### 9 







The [daily] grain offering and the drink offering are cut off From the house of the LORD; The priests mourn Who minister to the LORD. 















###### 10 







The field is ruined, The ground mourns; For the grain is ruined, The new wine is dried up, The fresh oil fails. 















###### 11 







Be ashamed, O farmers; Wail, O vinedressers, For the wheat and for the barley, Because the harvest of the field has perished. 















###### 12 







The vine dries up And the fig tree fails; The pomegranate, the palm also, and the apple tree, All the trees of the field dry up, Indeed, joy dries up _and_ withdraws From the sons of men. 















###### 13 







Clothe yourselves _with sackcloth_ And lament (cry out in grief), O priests; Wail, O ministers of the altar! Come, spend the night in sackcloth [and pray without ceasing], O ministers of my God, For the grain offering and the drink offering Are withheld from the house of your God. ## Starvation and Drought 















###### 14 







Consecrate a fast, Proclaim a solemn assembly, Gather the elders And all the inhabitants of the land To the house of the LORD your God, And cry out to the LORD [in penitent pleadings]. 















###### 15 







Alas for the day! For the [judgment] day of the LORD is at hand, And it will come [upon the nation] as a destruction from the [^c]Almighty. 















###### 16 







Has not the food been cut off before our eyes, Joy and gladness from the house of our God? 















###### 17 







The seeds [of grain] shrivel under the clods, The storehouses are desolate _and_ empty, The barns are in ruins Because the grain is dried up. 















###### 18 







How the animals groan! The herds of cattle are bewildered _and_ wander aimlessly Because they have no pasture; Even the flocks of sheep suffer. 















###### 19 







O LORD, I cry out to You, For fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness, And the flame has burned up all the trees of the field. 















###### 20 







Even the wild animals pant [in longing] for You; For the water brooks are dried up And fire has consumed the pastures of the wilderness. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

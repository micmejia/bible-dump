# Joel 3

***
















###### 1 







"For behold, in those [climactic] days and at that time, When I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem, 















###### 2 







I will gather together all the [Gentile] nations [that were hostile to My people] And bring them down into the Valley of Jehoshaphat (the LORD has judged). And there I will deal with them _and_ enter into judgment with them there For [their treatment of] My people, My inheritance, Israel, Whom they have scattered among the nations, And [because] they have encroached on My land _and_ divided it up. 















###### 3 







"They have also cast lots for My people, And have traded a boy for a prostitute And have sold a girl for wine that they may drink. 















###### 4 







Moreover, what are you to Me, O Tyre and Sidon and all the [five small] regions of Philistia? Will you pay Me back for something [I have supposedly done to you]? Even if you do pay Me back, I will swiftly and speedily return your deed [of retaliation] on your own head. 















###### 5 







Because you have taken My silver and My gold and have carried My precious treasures to your temples _and_ palaces, 















###### 6 







and have sold the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem to the Greeks, so that you may send them far away from their territory, 















###### 7 







behold, I am going to stir them up from the place where you have sold them [and return them to their land], and I shall return your action [of retaliation] on your own head. 















###### 8 







Also I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they will sell them to the [^a]Sabeans, to a distant nation," for the LORD has spoken. 















###### 9 







Proclaim this among the [pagan] nations: Prepare a war! Stir up the mighty men! Let all the men of war come near, let them come up! 















###### 10 







Beat your plowshares into swords And your pruning hooks into spears; Let the weak say, "I am strong!" 















###### 11 







Hurry and come, all you surrounding nations, And gather yourselves there; Bring down, O LORD, Your mighty ones (Your warriors). 















###### 12 







Let the nations be stirred [to action] And come up to the Valley of Jehoshaphat, For there I will sit to judge _and_ punish All the surrounding nations. 















###### 13 







Put in the sickle [of judgment], for the harvest is ripe; Come, tread [the grapes], for the wine press is full; The vats overflow, for the wickedness [of the people] is great. 















###### 14 







Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision (judgment)! For the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision [when judgment is executed]. 















###### 15 







The sun and the moon grow dark And the stars lose their brightness. 















###### 16 







The LORD thunders _and_ roars from Zion And utters His voice from Jerusalem [in judgment of His enemies], And the heavens and the earth tremble _and_ shudder; But the LORD is a refuge for His people And a stronghold [of protection] to the children of Israel. 















###### 17 







Then you will know _and_ understand fully that I am the LORD your God, Dwelling in Zion, My holy mountain. Then Jerusalem will be holy, And strangers [who do not belong] will no longer pass through it. ## Judah Will Be Blessed 















###### 18 







And in that day The mountains will drip with sweet wine And the hills will flow with milk; And all the brooks _and_ riverbeds of Judah will flow with water, And a fountain will go out from the house of the LORD To water the [desert] Valley of Shittim. 















###### 19 







Egypt will become a waste, And Edom will become a desolate wilderness, Because of their violence against the children of Judah, In whose land they have shed innocent blood. 















###### 20 







But Judah shall be inhabited forever And Jerusalem from generation to generation. 















###### 21 







And I shall avenge their blood which I have not avenged, For the LORD dwells in Zion. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

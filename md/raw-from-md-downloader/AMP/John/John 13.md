# John 13

***
















###### 1 







Now before the Passover Feast, Jesus knew that His hour had come [and it was time] for Him to leave this world _and_ return to the Father. Having [greatly] loved His own who were in the world, He loved them [and continuously loves them with His perfect love] to the end (eternally). 















###### 2 







It was during supper, when the devil had already put [the thought of] betraying Jesus into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, 















###### 3 







that Jesus, knowing that the Father had put everything into His hands, and that He had come from God and was [now] returning to God, 















###### 4 







got up from supper, took off His [outer] robe, and taking a [servant's] towel, He tied it around His waist. ## Jesus Washes the Disciples' Feet 















###### 5 







Then He poured water into the basin and began washing the disciples' feet and wiping them with the towel which was tied around His waist. 















###### 6 







When He came to Simon Peter, he said to Him, "Lord, are You going to wash my feet?" 















###### 7 







Jesus replied to him, "You do not realize now what I am doing, but you will [fully] understand it later." 















###### 8 







Peter said to Him, "You will never wash my feet!" Jesus answered, "Unless I wash you, you have no part with Me [we can have nothing to do with each other]." 















###### 9 







Simon Peter said to Him, "Lord, [in that case, wash] not only my feet, but also my hands and my head!" 















###### 10 







Jesus said to him, "Anyone who has bathed needs only to wash his feet, and is completely clean. And you [My disciples] are clean, but not all _of you_." 















###### 11 







For He knew who was going to betray Him; for that reason He said, "Not all of you are clean." 















###### 12 







So when He had washed their feet and put on His [outer] robe and reclined _at the table_ again, He said to them, "Do you understand what I have done for you? 















###### 13 







You call Me Teacher and Lord, and you are right in doing so, for _that is who_ I am. 















###### 14 







So if I, the Lord and the Teacher, washed your feet, you ought to wash one another's feet as well. 















###### 15 







For I gave you [this as] an example, so that you should do [in turn] as I did to you. 















###### 16 







I assure you _and_ most solemnly say to you, a slave is not greater than his master, nor is one who is sent greater than the one who sent him. 















###### 17 







If you know these things, you are blessed [happy and favored by God] if you put them into practice [and faithfully do them]. 















###### 18 







I am not speaking of all of you. I know whom I have chosen; but [this has happened] in order that the Scripture may be fulfilled: 'He who eats My bread has raised up his heel against Me [as My enemy].' 















###### 19 







From now on I am telling you [what will happen] before it occurs, so that when it does take place you may believe that I am _He_ [who I say I am--the Christ, the Anointed, the Messiah]. 















###### 20 







I assure you _and_ most solemnly say to you, the one who receives _and_ welcomes whomever I send receives Me; and the one who receives Me receives Him who sent Me [in that same way]." ## Jesus Predicts His Betrayal 















###### 21 







After Jesus had said these things, He was [^a]troubled in spirit, and testified and said, "I assure you _and_ most solemnly say to you, one of you will betray Me _and_ hand Me over." 















###### 22 







The disciples _began_ looking at one another, puzzled _and_ disturbed as to whom He could mean. 















###### 23 







[^b]One of His disciples, whom Jesus loved (esteemed), was [^c]leaning against Jesus' chest. 















###### 24 







So Simon Peter motioned to him (John) and [quietly] asked [him to ask Jesus] of whom He was speaking. 















###### 25 







Then leaning back against Jesus' chest, he (John) asked Him [privately], "Lord, who is it?" 















###### 26 







Jesus answered, "It is the one to whom I am going to give this piece [of bread] after I have dipped it." So when He had dipped the piece of bread [into the dish], He gave it to Judas, _son_ of Simon Iscariot. 















###### 27 







After [Judas had taken] the piece of bread, Satan entered him. Then Jesus said to him, "What you are going to do, do quickly [without delay]." 















###### 28 







But no one reclining _at the table_ knew why He said _this_ to him. 















###### 29 







Some thought that, since Judas [as the treasurer of the group] had the money box, Jesus was telling him, "Buy what we need for the feast," or that he was to [^d]give something to the poor. 















###### 30 







After taking the piece of bread, he went out immediately; and it was night. 















###### 31 







So when Judas had left, Jesus said, "Now is [the time for] the Son of Man [to be] glorified, and God is glorified in Him; 















###### 32 







[^e][if God is glorified in Him,] God will also glorify Him (the Son) in Himself, and will glorify Him at once. 















###### 33 







Little children, I am with you [only] a little longer. You will look for Me and, as I told the Jews, so I tell you now, 'Where I am going, you are not able to come.' 















###### 34 







I am giving you a new commandment, that you [^f]love one another. Just as I have loved you, so you too are to love one another. 















###### 35 







By this everyone will know that you are My disciples, if you have love _and_ unselfish concern for one another." 















###### 36 







Simon Peter said to Him, "Lord, where are You going?" Jesus answered, "Where I am going, you cannot follow Me now; but you will be able to follow later." 















###### 37 







Peter said to Him, "Lord, why cannot I follow You now? I will lay down my life for You!" 















###### 38 







Jesus answered, "Will you [really] lay down your life for Me? I assure you _and_ most solemnly say to you, before a rooster crows you will deny _and_ completely disown Me three times. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: John 13:23 Probably John the Apostle, author of this Gospel and brother of James the Apostle. The mother of John and James was Salome, who is believed to be the sister of Mary, the mother of Jesus. If so, Jesus and the brothers were related as cousins. [^c]: John 13:23 As was customary in ancient times, everyone at the meal was reclining on his side on a long dining couch or bench. When there was a pause during the meal for discussion, it was common among close friends for one to lean back on the chest or shoulder of the other. [^d]: John 13:29 Passover was considered a special time for charitable gifts to the poor. [^e]: John 13:32 Most early mss do not contain this phrase. [^f]: John 13:34 The key to understanding this and other statements about love is to know that this love (the Greek word _agape_) is not so much a matter of emotion as it is of doing things for the benefit of another person, that is, having an unselfish concern for another and a willingness to seek the best for another.

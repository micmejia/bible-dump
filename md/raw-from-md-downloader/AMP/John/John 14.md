# John 14

***
















###### 1 







"Do not let your heart be troubled (afraid, cowardly). Believe [confidently] in God _and_ trust in Him, [have faith, hold on to it, rely on it, keep going and] believe also in Me. 















###### 2 







In My Father's house are many dwelling places. If it were not so, I would have told you, because I am going there to prepare a place for you. 















###### 3 







And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back again and I will take you to Myself, so that where I am you may be also. 















###### 4 







And [to the place] where I am going, you know the way." 















###### 5 







Thomas said to Him, "Lord, we do not know where You are going; so how can we know the way?" 















###### 6 







Jesus said to him, "[^a]I am the [only] Way [to God] and the [real] Truth and the [real] Life; no one comes to the Father but through Me. ## Jesus' Oneness with the Father 















###### 7 







If you had [really] known Me, you would also have known My Father. From now on you know Him, and have seen Him." 















###### 8 







Philip said to Him, "Lord, show us the Father and then we will be satisfied." 















###### 9 







Jesus said to him, "Have I been with you for so long a time, and you do not know Me yet, Philip, _nor_ recognize clearly who I am? Anyone who has seen Me has seen the Father. How can you say, 'Show us the Father?' 















###### 10 







Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me? The words I say to you I do not say on My own initiative _or_ authority, but the Father, abiding _continually_ in Me, does His works [His attesting miracles and acts of power]. 















###### 11 







Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me; otherwise believe [Me] because of the [very] works themselves [which you have witnessed]. 















###### 12 







I assure you _and_ most solemnly say to you, anyone who believes in Me [as Savior] will also do the things that I do; and he will do even greater things than these [in extent and outreach], because I am going to the Father. 















###### 13 







And I will do whatever you ask in My name [[^b]as My representative], this I will do, so that the Father may be glorified _and_ celebrated in the Son. 















###### 14 







If you ask Me anything in My name [as My representative], I will do it. 















###### 15 







"If you [really] love Me, you will keep _and_ obey My commandments. ## Role of the Spirit 















###### 16 







And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another [^c]Helper (Comforter, Advocate, Intercessor--Counselor, Strengthener, Standby), to be with you forever-- 















###### 17 







the Spirit of Truth, whom the world cannot receive [and take to its heart] because it does not see Him or know Him, _but_ you know Him because He (the Holy Spirit) remains with you _continually_ and will be in you. 















###### 18 







"I will not leave you as orphans [comfortless, bereaved, and helpless]; I will come [back] to you. 















###### 19 







After a little while the world will no longer see Me, but you will see Me; because I live, you will live also. 















###### 20 







On that day [when that time comes] you will know for yourselves that I am in My Father, and you _are_ in Me, and I _am_ in you. 















###### 21 







The person who has My commandments and keeps them is the one who [really] loves Me; and whoever [really] loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and reveal Myself to him [I will make Myself real to him]." 















###### 22 







Judas **(**not Iscariot**)** asked Him, "Lord, what has happened that You are going to reveal Yourself to us and not to the world?" 















###### 23 







Jesus answered, "If anyone [really] loves Me, he will keep My word (teaching); and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our dwelling place with him. 















###### 24 







One who does not [really] love Me does not keep My words. And the word (teaching) which you hear is not Mine, but is the Father's who sent Me. 















###### 25 







"I have told you these things while I am still with you. 















###### 26 







But the [^d]Helper (Comforter, Advocate, Intercessor--Counselor, Strengthener, Standby), the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name [in My place, to represent Me and act on My behalf], He will teach you all things. And He will help you remember everything that I have told you. 















###### 27 







Peace I leave with you; My [perfect] peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Do not let your heart be troubled, nor let it be afraid. [Let My perfect peace calm you in every circumstance and give you courage and strength for every challenge.] 















###### 28 







You heard Me tell you, 'I am going away, and I am coming _back_ to you.' If you [really] loved Me, you would have rejoiced, because I am going [back] to the Father, for [^e]the Father is greater than I. 















###### 29 







I have told you now before it happens, so that when it does take place, you may believe _and_ have faith [in Me]. 















###### 30 







I will not speak with you much longer, for the ruler of the world (Satan) is coming. And he has no claim on Me [no power over Me nor anything that he can use against Me]; 















###### 31 







but so that the world may know [without any doubt] that I love the Father, I do exactly as the Father has commanded Me [and act in full agreement with Him].

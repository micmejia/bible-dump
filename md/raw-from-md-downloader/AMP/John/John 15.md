# John 15

***
















###### 1 







"[^a]I am the true Vine, and My Father is the vinedresser. 















###### 2 







Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit, He takes away; and every _branch_ that continues to bear fruit, He [repeatedly] prunes, so that it will bear more fruit [even richer and finer fruit]. 















###### 3 







You are already clean because of the word which I have given you [the teachings which I have discussed with you]. 















###### 4 







Remain in Me, and I [will remain] in you. Just as no branch can bear fruit by itself without remaining in the vine, neither can you [bear fruit, producing evidence of your faith] unless you remain in Me. 















###### 5 







[^b]I am the Vine; you are the branches. The one who remains in Me and I in him bears much fruit, for [otherwise] apart from Me [that is, cut off from vital union with Me] you can do nothing. 















###### 6 







If anyone does not remain in Me, he is thrown out like a [broken off] branch, and withers _and_ dies; and they gather such branches and throw them into the fire, and they are burned. 















###### 7 







If you remain in Me and My words remain in you [that is, if we are vitally united and My message lives in your heart], ask whatever you wish and it will be done for you. 















###### 8 







My Father is glorified _and_ honored by this, when you bear much fruit, and prove yourselves to be My [true] disciples. 















###### 9 







I have loved you just as the Father has loved Me; remain in My love [and do not doubt My love for you]. 















###### 10 







If you keep My commandments _and_ obey My teaching, you will remain in My love, just as I have kept My Father's commandments and remain in His love. 















###### 11 







I have told you these things so that My joy _and_ delight may be in you, and that your joy may be made full _and_ complete _and_ overflowing. ## Disciples' Relation to Each Other 















###### 12 







"This is My commandment, that you [^c]love _and_ unselfishly seek the best for one another, just as I have loved you. 















###### 13 







No one has greater love [nor stronger commitment] than to lay down his own life for his friends. 















###### 14 







You are my friends if you keep on doing what I command you. 















###### 15 







I do not call you servants any longer, for the servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you [My] friends, because I have revealed to you everything that I have heard from My Father. 















###### 16 







You have not chosen Me, but I have chosen you and I have appointed _and_ placed _and_ purposefully planted you, so that you would go and bear fruit _and_ keep on bearing, and that your fruit will remain _and_ be lasting, so that whatever you ask of the Father in My name [as My representative] He may give to you. 















###### 17 







This [is what] I command you: that you love _and_ unselfishly seek the best for one another. ## Disciples' Relation to the World 















###### 18 







"If the world hates you [and it does], know that it has hated Me before _it hated_ you. 















###### 19 







If you belonged to the world, the world would love [you as] its own _and_ would treat you with affection. But you are not of the world [you no longer belong to it], but I have chosen you out of the world. And because of this the world hates you. 















###### 20 







Remember [and continue to remember] that I told you, 'A servant is not greater than his master.' If they persecuted Me, they will also persecute you. If they kept My word, they will keep yours also. 















###### 21 







But they will do all these [hurtful] things to you for My name's sake [because you bear My name and are identified with Me], for they do not know the One who sent Me. 















###### 22 







If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have [the guilt of their] sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin. 















###### 23 







The one who hates Me also hates My Father. 















###### 24 







If I had not done among them the works (attesting miracles) which no one else [ever] did, they would not have [the guilt of their] sin; but now [the fact is that] they have both seen [these works] and have hated Me [and continue to hate Me] and My Father as well. 















###### 25 







But [this is so] that the word which has been written in their Law would be fulfilled, 'They hated Me without a cause.' 















###### 26 







"But when the [^d]Helper (Comforter, Advocate, Intercessor--Counselor, Strengthener, Standby) comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, _that is_ the Spirit of Truth who comes from the Father, He will testify _and_ bear witness about Me. 















###### 27 







But you will testify also _and_ be My witnesses, because you have been with Me from the beginning. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

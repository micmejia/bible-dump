# John 16

***
















###### 1 







"I have told you these things so that you will not stumble _or_ be caught off guard _and_ fall away. 















###### 2 







They will put you out of the synagogues _and_ make you outcasts. And a time is coming when whoever kills you will think that he is offering service to God. 















###### 3 







And they will do these things because they have not known the Father or Me. 















###### 4 







I have told you these things [now], so that when their time comes, you will remember that I told you about them. I did not say these things to you at the beginning, because I was with you. ## The Holy Spirit Promised 















###### 5 







"But now I am going to Him who sent Me; and none of you asks Me, 'Where are You going?' 















###### 6 







But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your hearts [and taken complete possession of them]. 















###### 7 







But I tell you the truth, it is to your advantage that I go away; for if I do not go away, the [^a]Helper (Comforter, Advocate, Intercessor--Counselor, Strengthener, Standby) will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him (the Holy Spirit) to you [to be in close fellowship with you]. 















###### 8 







And He, when He comes, will convict the world about [the guilt of] sin [and the need for a Savior], and about righteousness, and about judgment: 















###### 9 







about sin [and the true nature of it], because they do not believe in Me [and My message]; 















###### 10 







about righteousness [personal integrity and godly character], because I am going to My Father and you will no longer see Me; 















###### 11 







about judgment [the certainty of it], because the ruler of this world (Satan) has been judged _and_ condemned. 















###### 12 







"I have many more things to say to you, but you cannot bear [to hear] them now. 















###### 13 







But when He, the Spirit of Truth, comes, He will guide you into all the truth [full and complete truth]. For He will not speak on His own initiative, but He will speak whatever He hears [from the Father--the message regarding the Son], and He will disclose to you what is to come [in the future]. 















###### 14 







He will glorify _and_ honor Me, because He (the Holy Spirit) will take from what is Mine and will disclose it to you. 















###### 15 







All things that the Father has are Mine. Because of this I said that He [the Spirit] will take from what is Mine and will reveal it to you. ## Jesus' Death and Resurrection Foretold 















###### 16 







"A little while, and you will no longer see Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me." 















###### 17 







Some of His disciples said to one another, "What does He mean when He tells us, 'A little while, and you will not see Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me'; and, 'because I am going to My Father'?" 















###### 18 







So they were saying, "What does He mean when He says, 'A little while'? We do not know what He is talking about." 















###### 19 







Jesus knew that they wanted to ask Him, so He said to them, "Are you wondering among yourselves about what I meant when I said, 'A little while, and you will not see Me, and again a little while, and you will see Me'? 















###### 20 







I assure you _and_ most solemnly say to you, that you will weep and grieve [in great mourning], but the world will rejoice. You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy. 















###### 21 







A woman, when she is in labor, has pain because her time [to give birth] has come; but when she has given birth to the child, she no longer remembers the anguish because of her joy that a child has come into the world. 















###### 22 







So for now you are in grief; but I will see you again, and [then] your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take away from you your [great] joy. ## Prayer Promises 















###### 23 







In that day you will not [need to] ask Me about anything. I assure you _and_ most solemnly say to you, whatever you ask the Father in My name [as My representative], He will give you. 















###### 24 







Until now you have not asked [the Father] for anything in My name; but now ask _and_ keep on asking and you will receive, so that your joy may be full _and_ complete. 















###### 25 







"I have told you these things in figurative language (veiled language, proverbs); the hour is now coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures of speech, but I will tell you plainly about the Father. 















###### 26 







In that day you will ask in My name, and I am not saying to you that I will ask the Father on your behalf [because it will be unnecessary]; 















###### 27 







for the Father Himself [tenderly] loves you, because you have loved Me and have believed that I came from the Father. 















###### 28 







I came from the Father and have come into the world; again, I am leaving the world and going to the Father." 















###### 29 







His disciples said, "Ah, now You are speaking plainly to us and not in figures of speech! 















###### 30 







Now we know that You know all things, and have no need for anyone to question You; because of this we believe [without any doubt] that you came from God." 















###### 31 







Jesus answered them, "Do you now [at last] believe? 















###### 32 







Take careful notice: an hour is coming, and has arrived, when you will all be scattered, each to his own _home_, leaving Me alone; and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me. 















###### 33 







I have told you these things, so that in Me you may have [perfect] peace. In the world you have tribulation _and_ distress _and_ suffering, but be courageous [be confident, be undaunted, be filled with joy]; I have overcome the world."

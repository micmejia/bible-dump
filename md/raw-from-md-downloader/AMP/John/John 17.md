# John 17

***
















###### 1 







When Jesus had spoken these things, He raised His eyes to heaven [in prayer] and said, "Father, the [^a]hour has come. Glorify Your Son, so that Your Son may glorify You. 















###### 2 







Just as You have given Him power _and_ authority over all mankind, [now glorify Him] so that He may give eternal life [^b]to all whom You have given Him [to be His--permanently and forever]. 















###### 3 







Now this is eternal life: that they may know You, the only true [supreme and sovereign] God, and [in the same manner know] Jesus [as the] Christ whom You have sent. 















###### 4 







I have glorified You [down here] on the earth by [^c]completing the work that You gave Me to do. 















###### 5 







Now, Father, glorify Me together with Yourself, with the glory _and_ majesty that I had with You before the world existed. 















###### 6 







"I have manifested Your name [and revealed Your very self, Your real self] to the people whom You have given Me out of the world; they were Yours and You gave them to Me, and they have kept _and_ obeyed Your word. 















###### 7 







Now [at last] they know [with confident assurance] that all You have given Me is from You [it is really and truly Yours]. 















###### 8 







For the words which You gave Me I have given them; and they received _and_ accepted them and truly understood [with confident assurance] that I came from You [from Your presence], and they believed [without any doubt] that You sent Me. 















###### 9 







I pray for them; I do not pray for the world, but for those You have given Me, because they belong to You; 















###### 10 







and all things that are Mine are Yours, and [all things that are] Yours are Mine; and I am glorified in them. 















###### 11 







I am no longer in the world; yet they are still in the world, and I am coming to You. Holy Father, keep them in Your name, _the name_ which You have given Me, so that they may be one just as We are. 















###### 12 







While I was with them, I was keeping them in Your name which You have given Me; and I guarded them _and_ protected them, and not one of them was lost except [^d]the son of destruction, so that the Scripture would be fulfilled. ## The Disciples in the World 















###### 13 







But now I am coming to You; and I say these things [while I am still] in the world so that they may experience My joy made full _and_ complete _and_ perfect within them [filling their hearts with My delight]. 















###### 14 







I have given to them Your word [the message You gave Me]; and the world has hated them because they are not of the world _and_ do not belong to the world, just as I am not of the world _and_ do not belong to it. 















###### 15 







I do not ask You to take them out of the world, but that You keep them _and_ protect them from the evil one. 















###### 16 







They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world. 















###### 17 







Sanctify them in the truth [set them apart for Your purposes, make them holy]; Your word is truth. 















###### 18 







Just as You commissioned _and_ sent Me into the world, I also have commissioned _and_ sent them (believers) into the world. 















###### 19 







For their sake [^e]I sanctify Myself [to do Your will], so that they also may be sanctified [set apart, dedicated, made holy] in [Your] truth. 















###### 20 







"I do not pray for these alone [it is not for their sake only that I make this request], but also for [all] those who [will ever] believe _and_ trust in Me through their message, 















###### 21 







that they all may be one; just as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be one in Us, so that the world may believe [without any doubt] that You sent Me. ## Their Future Glory 















###### 22 







I have given to them the glory _and_ honor which You have given Me, that they may be one, just as We are one; 















###### 23 







I in them and You in Me, that they may be perfected _and_ completed into one, so that the world may know [without any doubt] that You sent Me, and [that You] have loved them, just as You have loved Me. 















###### 24 







Father, I desire that they also, whom You have given to Me [as Your gift to Me], may be with Me where I am, so that they may see My glory which You have given Me, because You loved Me before the foundation of the world. 















###### 25 







"O just _and_ righteous Father, although the world has not known You _and_ has never acknowledged You [and the revelation of Your mercy], yet I have _always_ known You; and these [believers] know [without any doubt] that You sent Me; 















###### 26 







and I have made Your name known to them, and will _continue to_ make it known, so that the love with which You have loved Me may be in them [overwhelming their heart], and I [may be] in them." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: John 17:2 A reference to election or predestination. Also see John 6:39; 17:6, 9, 24; Acts 13:48; Rom 8:29-33; Eph 1:3-6; 2 Thess 2:13; 1 Pet 1:2. [^c]: John 17:4 Much of Jesus’ discourse and prayer in John 13-17 is reminiscent of God’s comparison of rain and snow to His word in Is 55:10, 11. Like God’s word, Jesus, who was introduced by John as the Word (John 1:1), comes from God (John 16:28; 17:8), accomplishes God’s desire (John 14:10; 17:4, 8) and then returns to God (John 13:33; 14:4; 17:13).The themes of joy and peace found in Isaiah 55:12 also resonate throughout John 13-17; joy (John 15:11; 16:20-24; 17:13) and peace (John 14:27; 16:33). Isaiah 55; 56 has many points of connection with John’s Gospel as a whole, most notably the invitations to quench thirst (Is 55:1; John 4:13, 14; 7:37) and receive bread (Is 55:2; John 6:26-35, 48-51). Other points of connection between Is 55; 56 and John include the tie between listening and living, appeals to witnesses, calls to obedience, the idea of a special window of God’s nearness, and the inclusion of the Gentiles in salvation. [^d]: John 17:12 Hebrew idiom for one destined to perish. The betrayal of Christ by Judas Iscariot was foretold in Ps 41:9; cf John 13:18. [^e]: John 17:19 Jesus’ sacrificial death allows Christians to be truly sanctified—set apart for God’s purpose.

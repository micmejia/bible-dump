# John 5

***
















###### 1 







Later on there was a Jewish feast (festival), and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 















###### 2 







Now in Jerusalem, near the Sheep Gate, there is a [^a]pool, which is called in Hebrew (Jewish Aramaic) Bethesda, having five porticoes (alcoves, colonnades). 















###### 3 







In these _porticoes_ lay a great number of people who were sick, blind, lame, withered, [^b][waiting for the stirring of the water; 















###### 4 







for an angel of the Lord went down into the pool at appointed seasons and stirred up the water; the first one to go in after the water was stirred was healed of his disease.] 















###### 5 







There was a certain man there who had been ill for thirty-eight years. 















###### 6 







When Jesus noticed him lying there [helpless], knowing that he had been _in that condition_ a long time, He said to him, "Do you want to get well?" 















###### 7 







The invalid answered, "Sir, I have no one to put me in the pool when the water is stirred up, and while I am coming [to get into it myself], someone else steps down ahead of me." 















###### 8 







Jesus said to him, "Get up; pick up your pallet and walk." 















###### 9 







Immediately the man was healed _and_ recovered his strength, and [^c]picked up his pallet and walked. Now that day was the Sabbath. 















###### 10 







So the Jews kept saying to the man who had been healed, "It is the Sabbath, and you are not [^d]permitted to pick up your pallet [because it is unlawful]." 















###### 11 







He answered them, "The Man who healed me _and_ gave me back my strength was the One who said to me, 'Pick up your pallet and walk.'" 















###### 12 







They asked him, "Who is the Man who told you, 'Pick up _your pallet_ and walk'?" 















###### 13 







Now the man who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had slipped away [unnoticed] since there was a crowd in that place. 















###### 14 







Afterward, Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, "See, you are well! Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you." 















###### 15 







The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well. 















###### 16 







For this reason the Jews began to persecute Jesus _continually_ because He was doing these things on the Sabbath. 















###### 17 







But Jesus answered them, "My Father has been working until now [He has never ceased working], and I too am working." ## Jesus' Equality with God 















###### 18 







This made the Jews more determined than ever to kill Him, for not only was He breaking the Sabbath [from their viewpoint], but He was also calling God His own Father, making Himself equal with God. 















###### 19 







So Jesus answered them by saying, "I assure you _and_ most solemnly say to you, the Son [^e]can do nothing of Himself [of His own accord], unless it is something He sees the Father doing; for whatever things the Father does, the Son [in His turn] also does in the same way. 















###### 20 







For the Father _dearly_ loves the Son and shows Him everything that He Himself is doing; and _the Father_ will show Him greater works than these, so that you will be filled with wonder. 















###### 21 







Just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life [and allows them to live on], even so the Son also gives life to whom He wishes. 















###### 22 







For the Father judges no one, but has given all judgment [that is, the prerogative of judging] to the Son [placing it entirely into His hands], 















###### 23 







so that all will give honor (reverence, homage) to the Son just as they give honor to the Father. [In fact] the one who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who has sent Him. 















###### 24 







"I assure you _and_ most solemnly say to you, the person who hears My word [the one who heeds My message], and believes _and_ trusts in Him who sent Me, has (possesses now) eternal life [that is, eternal life actually begins--the believer is transformed], and does not come into judgment _and_ condemnation, but has passed [over] from death into life. ## Two Resurrections 















###### 25 







I assure you _and_ most solemnly say to you, a time is coming and is [here] now, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear it will live. 















###### 26 







For just as the Father has life in Himself [and is self-existent], even so He has given to the Son to have life in Himself [and be self-existent]. 















###### 27 







And He has given Him authority to execute judgment, because He is a Son of Man [sinless humanity, qualifying Him to sit in judgment over mankind]. 















###### 28 







Do not be surprised at this; for a time is coming when all those who are in the tombs will hear His voice, 















###### 29 







and they will come out--those who did good things [will come out] to a resurrection of [new] life, but those who did evil things [will come out] to a resurrection of judgment [that is, to be sentenced]. 















###### 30 







"I can do nothing on my own initiative _or_ authority. Just as I hear, I judge; and My judgment is just (fair, righteous, unbiased), because I do not seek My own will, but only the will of Him who sent Me. 















###### 31 







"If I _alone_ testify about Myself, My testimony is not [^f]valid. 















###### 32 







There is another [My Father] who testifies about Me, and I know [without any doubt] that His testimony on My behalf is true _and_ valid. ## Testimony of John 















###### 33 







You have sent [an inquiry] to [^g]John [the Baptist] and he has testified [as an eyewitness] to the truth. 















###### 34 







But the testimony I receive is not from man [a merely human witness]; but I say these things so that you may be saved [that is, have eternal life]. 















###### 35 







John was the lamp that kept on burning and shining [to show you the way], and you were willing for a while to rejoice in his light. ## Testimony of Works 















###### 36 







But the testimony which I have is far greater than _the testimony of_ John; for the works that the Father has given Me to finish--the very same works [that is, the miracles and proofs of My deity] that I am [now] doing--testify about Me, [by providing evidence] that the Father has sent Me. ## Testimony of the Father 















###### 37 







And the Father who sent Me has Himself testified about Me. You have never heard His voice nor seen His form [His majesty and greatness--what He is like]. 















###### 38 







You do not have His word (Scripture) abiding in you [actually living in your hearts and minds], because you do not believe in Him whom He has sent. ## Testimony of the Scripture 















###### 39 







[^h]You search _and_ keep on searching _and_ examining the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and yet it is those [very Scriptures] that testify about Me; 















###### 40 







and still you are unwilling to come to Me so that you may have life. 















###### 41 







I do not receive glory _and_ approval from men; 















###### 42 







but I know you _and_ recognize that you do not have the love of God in yourselves. 















###### 43 







I have come in My Father's name _and_ with His power, and you do not receive Me [because your minds are closed]; but if another comes in his own name _and_ with no authority or power except his own, you will receive him _and_ give your approval to an imposter. 















###### 44 







How can you believe [in Me], when you [seek and] receive glory _and_ approval from one another, and yet you do not seek the glory _and_ approval which comes from the _one and_ only God? 















###### 45 







Do not think that I [am the One who] will accuse you before the Father. There [already] is one who accuses you: Moses, [the very one] in whom you have placed your hope [for salvation]. 















###### 46 







For if you believed _and_ relied on [the Scriptures written by] Moses, you would believe Me, for he wrote about Me [personally]. 















###### 47 







But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe My words?" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

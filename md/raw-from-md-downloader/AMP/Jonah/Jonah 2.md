# Jonah 2

***
















###### 1 







Then Jonah prayed to the LORD his God from the stomach of the fish, 















###### 2 







and said, "I called out of my trouble _and_ distress to the LORD, And He answered me; Out of the belly of Sheol I cried for help, And You heard my voice. 















###### 3 







"For You cast me into the deep, Into the [deep] heart of the seas, And the currents surrounded _and_ engulfed me; All Your breakers and billowing waves passed over me. 















###### 4 







"Then I said, 'I have been cast out of Your sight. Nevertheless I will look again toward Your holy temple.' 















###### 5 







"The waters surrounded me, to the point of death. The great deep engulfed me, Seaweed was wrapped around my head. 















###### 6 







"I descended to the [very] roots of the mountains. The earth with its bars closed behind me [bolting me in] forever, Yet You have brought up my life from the pit (death), O LORD my God. 















###### 7 







"When my soul was fainting within me, I remembered the LORD, And my prayer came to You, Into Your holy temple. 















###### 8 







"Those who regard _and_ follow worthless idols [^a]Turn away from their [living source of] mercy _and_ lovingkindness. 















###### 9 







"But [as for me], I will sacrifice to You With the voice of thanksgiving; I shall pay that which I have vowed. Salvation is from the LORD!" 















###### 10 







So the LORD commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah up onto the dry land. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

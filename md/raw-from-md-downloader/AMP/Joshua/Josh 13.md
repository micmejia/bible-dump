# Joshua 13

***
















###### 1 







Now Joshua was [^a]old and advanced in years, and the LORD said to him, "You have grown old and advanced in years, and very [^b]substantial portions of the land remain to be possessed. 















###### 2 







This is the land that remains: all the regions of the Philistines and all those of the Geshurites; 















###### 3 







from the Shihor [waterway] which is east of Egypt [at the southern end of Canaan], northward to the border of Ekron **(**all of it regarded as Canaanite**)**; the five rulers of the Philistines: the Gazite, Ashdodite, the Ashkelonite, the Gittite, the Ekronite; and the [^c]Avvite 















###### 4 







in the south, all the land of the Canaanite, and Mearah that belongs to the Sidonians, as far as Aphek, to the border of the Amorite; 















###### 5 







and the land of the Gebalite, and all Lebanon, toward [^d]the east, from Baal-gad below Mount Hermon to the entrance of Hamath. 















###### 6 







As for all the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephoth-maim, even all the Sidonians, I will drive them out before Israel; only allot the land to Israel as an inheritance just as I have commanded you. 















###### 7 







So now, divide this land [west of the Jordan] as an inheritance for the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh." 















###### 8 







With the other half-tribe [of Manasseh], the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance which Moses gave them beyond the Jordan eastward, just as Moses the servant of the LORD gave to them; 















###### 9 







from Aroer on the edge of the valley of the [river] Arnon, and the city in the middle of the valley, and all the plain of Medeba, as far as Dibon; 















###### 10 







and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, as far as the border of the Ammonites; 















###### 11 







and Gilead, and the territory of the Geshurites and Maacathites, and all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan as far as Salecah; 















###### 12 







the entire kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and Edrei--he alone was left of the remnant of the Rephaim [giants]--for Moses had struck them and dispossessed them. 















###### 13 







But the sons of Israel did not dispossess the Geshurites or the Maacathites; for Geshur and Maacath live among Israel to this day. 















###### 14 







It was only to the tribe of Levi that Moses gave no [territory as an] inheritance; the offerings by fire to the LORD, the God of Israel, are their inheritance, as He told him. 















###### 15 







So Moses gave _an inheritance_ to the tribe of the sons of Reuben according to their families. 















###### 16 







Their territory was from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the [river] Arnon, and the city which is in the middle of the valley and all the plain by Medeba; 















###### 17 







with Heshbon, and all its cities which are on the plain: Dibon and Bamoth-baal and Beth-baal-meon, 















###### 18 







and Jahaz and Kedemoth and Mephaath, 















###### 19 







and Kiriathaim and Sibmah and Zereth-shahar on the hill of the valley, 















###### 20 







and Beth-peor and the slopes of Pisgah and Beth-jeshimoth, 















###### 21 







even all the cities of the plain and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses struck down along with the leaders of Midian, Evi and Rekem and Zur and Hur and Reba, the princes of Sihon, who lived in the land. 















###### 22 







The sons of Israel also killed Balaam the son of Beor, the diviner (soothsayer), with the sword among [the rest of] their slain. 















###### 23 







The border of the sons of Reuben was the Jordan. This was the inheritance of the sons of Reuben according to their families, with their cities and villages. 















###### 24 







Moses also gave _an inheritance_ to the tribe of Gad, to the sons of Gad, according to their families. 















###### 25 







Their territory was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the sons of Ammon, as far as Aroer east of Rabbah; 















###### 26 







and from Heshbon as far as Ramath-mizpeh and Betonim, and from Mahanaim as far as the border of Debir; 















###### 27 







and in the valley, Beth-haram and Beth-nimrah and Succoth and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, with the Jordan as a border, as far as the _lower_ end of the Sea of Chinnereth (Galilee) east of the Jordan. 















###### 28 







This is the inheritance of the sons of Gad according to their families, with their cities and their villages. 















###### 29 







Moses also gave _an inheritance_ to the half-tribe of Manasseh; and it was for the half-tribe of the sons of Manasseh according to their families. 















###### 30 







Their region extended from Mahanaim, all Bashan, the entire kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, sixty cities; 















###### 31 







also half of Gilead, with Ashtaroth and Edrei, the cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan; these were for the sons of Machir the son of Manasseh, for half of the sons of Machir according to their families (clans). 















###### 32 







These are _the territories_ which Moses distributed as an inheritance in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan at Jericho to the east. 















###### 33 







But to the tribe of Levi, Moses did not give an inheritance; the LORD, the God of Israel, is their inheritance, as He told them. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Joshua 15

***
















###### 1 







Now the lot (allotment) for the tribe of the sons of Judah according to their families reached [southward to] the border of Edom, southward to the wilderness of Zin at its most southern part. 















###### 2 







Their southern border was from the lower end of the Salt (Dead) Sea, from the bay that turns southward. 















###### 3 







Then it proceeded southward to the ascent of Akrabbim and continued along to Zin, and then went by the south of Kadesh-barnea and continued along to Hezron, and went up to Addar and turned about to Karka. 















###### 4 







It continued along to Azmon and proceeded to the [^a]Brook of Egypt (Wadi el-Arish), and the border ended at the [Mediterranean] sea. This was their southern border. 















###### 5 







The eastern border was the Salt (Dead) Sea, as far as the mouth of the Jordan. The northern border was from the bay of the sea at the mouth of the Jordan. 















###### 6 







Then the border went up to Beth-hoglah, and continued along north of Beth-arabah, and the border went up to the [landmark of the] stone of Bohan the son of Reuben. 















###### 7 







The border went up to Debir from the Valley of Achor, and turned northward toward Gilgal which is opposite the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south side of the valley; and the border continued on to the waters of En-shemesh and ended at En-rogel. 















###### 8 







Then the border went up by the Valley of Ben-hinnom (son of Hinnom) at the southern slope of the Jebusite [city] **(**that is, Jerusalem**)**; and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lies before the Valley of Hinnom to the west, which is at the northern end of the Valley of Rephaim. 















###### 9 







Then the border extended from the top of the mountain to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah and proceeded to the cities of Mount Ephron; then the border curved to Baalah **(**that is, Kiriath-jearim**)**. 















###### 10 







The border went around west from Baalah to Mount Seir, and passed along to the northern slope of Mount Jearim **(**that is, Chesalon**)**, and went down to Beth-shemesh and then continued on through Timnah. 















###### 11 







The border proceeded to the slope [of the hill] of Ekron northward, then curved to Shikkeron and continued to Mount Baalah and proceeded to Jabneel. Then the border ended at the [Mediterranean] sea. 















###### 12 







The western border was at the Great Sea, with its coastline. This is the border around the tribe of the sons of Judah according to their families. 















###### 13 







Now to Caleb the son of Jephunneh Joshua gave a portion among the sons of Judah, as the LORD commanded him, _namely_, Kiriath-arba, _Arba being_ the father of Anak **(**that is, Hebron**)**. 















###### 14 







So Caleb drove out from there the three sons of Anak: Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai, the children of Anak. 















###### 15 







Then he went up from there against the people of Debir; Debir was formerly named Kiriath-sepher. 















###### 16 







Caleb said, "I will give Achsah my daughter as wife to the man who attacks Kiriath-sepher and captures it." 















###### 17 







And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's brother, captured it; so he gave him Achsah his daughter as a wife. 















###### 18 







Now it came about that when Achsah came _to Othniel_, she persuaded him [to allow her] to ask her father for a field. Then she [rode up to Caleb and] dismounted from her donkey, and Caleb said to her, "What do you want?" 















###### 19 







Achsah answered, "Give me a blessing; since you have given me the [dry] land of the Negev (South country), give me springs of water, too." So he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs. 















###### 20 







This is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Judah according to their families (clans).

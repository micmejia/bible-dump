# Joshua 18

***
















###### 1 







Then the whole congregation of the Israelites assembled at Shiloh [in the tribal territory of Ephraim], and set up the Tent of Meeting there; and the land was subdued before them. 















###### 2 







There remained among the Israelites [^a]seven tribes who had not yet divided their inheritance. 















###### 3 







So Joshua asked them, "How long will you put off entering to take possession of the land which the LORD, the God of your fathers, has given you? 















###### 4 







Provide for yourselves three men from each tribe so that I may send them, and that they may go through the land and write a description of it with regard to their [tribal] inheritance; then they shall return to me. 















###### 5 







They shall divide it into seven parts; [the tribe of] Judah shall remain in its territory on the south, and the [^b]house of Joseph shall remain in its territory on the north. 















###### 6 







You shall describe the land in seven divisions, and bring _the description_ here to me. I will cast lots for you here [^c]before the LORD our God. 















###### 7 







But the Levites have no portion among you, because the priesthood of the LORD is [^d]their inheritance. Gad and Reuben and half the tribe of Manasseh also have received their inheritance eastward beyond the Jordan, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them." 















###### 8 







So the men arose and went [on their way], and Joshua commanded those who went to describe the land, saying, "Go and walk throughout the land and describe it, and return to me; and I will cast lots for you here before the LORD in Shiloh." 















###### 9 







So the men set out and passed through the land, and described it by cities in seven divisions in a book; and they came back to Joshua to the camp at Shiloh. 















###### 10 







Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD, and there Joshua divided the land to the sons of Israel, [to each tribe] according to their portions. ## The Territory of Benjamin 















###### 11 







Now the lot (allotment) of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin came up according to their families, and the territory of their lot fell between [the tribes of] the sons of Judah and the sons of Joseph. 















###### 12 







On the north side their border began at the Jordan, then it went up the slope of Jericho on the north, and up through the hill country westward, and it ended at the Beth-aven wilderness. 















###### 13 







Then the border continued southward toward Luz, to the slope of Luz **(**that is, Bethel**)**; then the border went down to Ataroth-addar, by the hill that lies south of lower Beth-horon. 















###### 14 







The border changed course [from there] and turned around on the western side southward, from the hill that lies to the south opposite Beth-horon; it ended at Kiriath-baal **(**that is, Kiriath-jearim**)**, a city of [the tribe of] the sons of Judah. This _formed_ the western side [of Benjamin's territory]. 















###### 15 







The southern side was from the edge of Kiriath-jearim, and the border went on westward and went to the source of the waters of Nephtoah. 















###### 16 







Then the border went down to the edge of the hill overlooking the Valley of Ben-hinnom (son of Hinnom), which is at the north end of the Valley of Rephaim; and it descended to the Valley of Hinnom, south to the slope of the Jebusite, and went on down to En-rogel. 















###### 17 







Then it turned toward the north and went on to En-shemesh and on to Geliloth, which is opposite the ascent of Adummim, and it went down to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben. 















###### 18 







It continued to the north to the side opposite [Beth-] Arabah and went down to the Arabah. 















###### 19 







The border continued along to the north of the slope of Beth-hoglah; and the border ended at the northern bay of the Salt (Dead) Sea, at the south end of the Jordan. This was the southern border. 















###### 20 







And the Jordan River was its border on the east side. This was the inheritance of the sons of Benjamin, according to their families and according to its borders all around. 















###### 21 







Now the cities of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho and Beth-hoglah and Emek-keziz, 















###### 22 







and Beth-arabah and Zemaraim and Bethel, 















###### 23 







and Avvim and Parah and Ophrah, 















###### 24 







and Chephar-ammoni and Ophni and Geba; twelve cities with their villages; 















###### 25 







Gibeon and Ramah and Beeroth, 















###### 26 







and Mizpeh and Chephirah and Mozah, 















###### 27 







and Rekem and Irpeel and Taralah, 















###### 28 







and Zelah, Haeleph and the Jebusite **(**that is, Jerusalem**)**, Gibeah, Kiriath; fourteen cities with their villages. This is the inheritance of [the tribe of] the sons of Benjamin according to their families (clans). ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

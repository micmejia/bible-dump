# Judges 14

***
















###### 1 







Samson went down to Timnah and at Timnah he saw a woman, one of the daughters of the Philistines. 















###### 2 







So he went back and told his father and his mother, "I saw a woman in Timnah, one of the daughters of the Philistines; now get her for me as a wife." 















###### 3 







But his father and mother said to him, "Is there no woman among the daughters of your relatives, or among all our people, that you must go to take a wife from the uncircumcised (pagan) Philistines?" And Samson said to his father, "Get her for me, because she [^a]looks pleasing to me." 















###### 4 







His father and mother did not know that it was of the LORD, and that He was seeking an occasion [to take action] against the Philistines. Now at that time the Philistines were ruling over Israel. 















###### 5 







Then Samson went down to Timnah with his father and mother [to arrange the marriage], and they came as far as the vineyards of Timnah; and [^b]suddenly, a young lion _came_ roaring toward him. 















###### 6 







The Spirit of the LORD came upon him mightily, and he tore the lion apart as one tears apart a young goat, and he had nothing at all in his hand; but he did not tell his father or mother what he had done. 















###### 7 







So he went down and talked with the woman; and she looked pleasing to Samson. 















###### 8 







When he returned later to take her, he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion; and behold, a swarm of bees and honey were in the body of the lion. 















###### 9 







So he scraped the honey out into his hands and went on, eating as he went. When he came to his father and mother, he gave them _some_, and they ate it; but he did not tell them he had taken the honey from the body of the lion. 















###### 10 







His father went down to the woman, and Samson prepared a feast there, for that was the customary thing for young men to do. 















###### 11 







When the people saw him, they brought thirty companions (wedding attendants) to be with him. ## Samson's Riddle 















###### 12 







Then Samson said to them, "Let me now ask you a riddle; if you can tell me what it is within the seven days of the feast, and solve it, then I will give you thirty linen tunics (undergarments) and thirty changes of [outer] clothing. 















###### 13 







But if you are unable to tell me [the answer], then you shall give me thirty linen tunics (undergarments) and thirty changes of [outer] clothing." And they said to him, "Ask your riddle, so that we may hear it." 















###### 14 







So he said to them, "Out of the eater came something to eat, And out of the strong came something sweet." And they could not solve the riddle in three days. 















###### 15 







Then on the fourth day they said to Samson's wife, "Persuade your husband to tell us [through you] the [answer to the] riddle, or we will burn you and your father's household with fire. Have you invited us to make us poor? Is this not _true_?" 















###### 16 







So Samson's wife wept before him and said, "You only hate me, you do not love me; you have asked my countrymen a riddle, and have not told [the answer] to me." And he said to her, "Listen, I have not told my father or my mother [either], so [why] should I tell you?" 















###### 17 







However Samson's wife wept before him seven days while their [wedding] feast lasted, and on the seventh day he told her because she pressed him so hard. Then she told the [answer to the] riddle to her countrymen. 















###### 18 







So the men of the city said to Samson on the seventh day before sundown, "What is sweeter than honey? What is stronger than a lion?" And he said to them, "If you had not plowed with [^c]my heifer, You would not have solved my riddle." 















###### 19 







Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon him mightily, and he went down to Ashkelon and killed thirty of them and took their gear, and gave changes _of clothes_ to those who had explained the riddle. And his anger burned, and he went up to his father's house. 















###### 20 







But Samson's wife was _given_ to his [^d]companion who had been his friend. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

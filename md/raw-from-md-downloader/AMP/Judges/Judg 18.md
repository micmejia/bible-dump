# Judges 18

***
















###### 1 







In those days there was no king in Israel; and in those days the tribe of the Danites was seeking an inheritance [of land] for themselves to live in, for until then an [^a]inheritance had not been allotted to them as a possession among the tribes of Israel. 















###### 2 







So the sons of Dan sent from the total number of their [extended] family five brave men from Zorah and Eshtaol, to scout the land and to explore it; and they said to them, "Go, explore the land." They came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and lodged there. 















###### 3 







When they passed near Micah's house, they recognized the voice of the young man, the Levite, and they turned aside there and said to him, "Who brought you here? And what are you doing in this place? And what do you have here?" 















###### 4 







And he said to them, "Micah has done this and that for me, and he has hired me and I have become his priest." 















###### 5 







And they said to him, "Please ask of God, so that we may know whether our journey on which we are going will be successful." 















###### 6 







The priest said to them, "Go in peace; the journey on which you are going is acceptable to the LORD." 















###### 7 







Then the five men went on and came to Laish and saw the people who were there, [how they were] living securely in the style of the Sidonians, quiet and peaceful; and there was no oppressive magistrate in the land humiliating _them_ in anything, and they were far from the Sidonians and had no dealings with anyone. 















###### 8 







The five men came back [home] to their brothers at Zorah and Eshtaol, and their brothers said to them, "What _do_ you _have to report_?" 















###### 9 







They said, "Arise, let us go up against them; for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very good (fertile). Will you sit still _and_ do nothing? Do not hesitate to go, to enter, to take possession of the land. 















###### 10 







When you enter, you will come to people [feeling] safe and secure with a spacious land [widely extended on all sides]; for God has given it into your hands--a place where there is no lack of anything that is on the earth." 















###### 11 







Then from the [tribal] family of the Danites, from Zorah and from Eshtaol, six hundred men armed with weapons of war set out. 















###### 12 







They went up and camped at Kiriath-jearim in Judah. Therefore they have called that place [^b]Mahaneh-dan to this day; it is west of Kiriath-jearim. 















###### 13 







They went on from there to the hill country of Ephraim and came to Micah's house. ## Danites Take Micah's Idols 















###### 14 







Then the five men who had gone to scout the country of Laish said to their relatives, "Do you know that there are in these houses an ephod, teraphim, an image [of silver-plated wood], and a cast image [of solid silver]? Now therefore, consider what you should do." 















###### 15 







So they turned in that direction and came to the house of the young Levite, at the home of Micah, and asked him how he was doing. 















###### 16 







Now the six hundred men armed with their weapons of war, who were of the sons of Dan, stood at the entrance of the gate. 















###### 17 







Now the five men who had gone to scout the land went up and entered the house and took the image [of silver-plated wood], the ephod, the teraphim, and the cast image [of solid silver], while the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men armed with weapons of war. 















###### 18 







When these [five men] went into Micah's house and took the [plated] image, the ephod, the teraphim, and the cast image, the priest asked them, "What are you doing?" 















###### 19 







They said to him, "Keep quiet, put your hand over your mouth and come with us, and be a father and a priest to us. Is it better for you to be a priest to the house of one man, or to be a priest to a tribe and family in Israel?" 















###### 20 







The priest's heart was glad [to hear that], and he took the ephod, the teraphim, and the image, and went among the people. 















###### 21 







So they turned and left, and they put the children, the livestock, and the valuables _and_ supplies in front of them. 















###### 22 







When they had gone some distance from the house of Micah, the men who were [living] in the houses near Micah's house assembled [as a militia] and overtook the sons of Dan. 















###### 23 







They shouted to the Danites, who turned and said to Micah, "What is your _reason_ for assembling [against us]?" 















###### 24 







He said, "You have taken away my gods which I have made, and the priest, and have gone away; what else do I have left? How can you say to me, 'What is your _reason_?'" 















###### 25 







The sons of Dan said to him, "Do not let your voice [of complaint] be heard among us, or else angry men will assault you and you will lose your life, along with the lives of [everyone in] your household." 















###### 26 







Then the Danites went on their way; and Micah saw that they were too strong for him, so he turned and went back to his house. 















###### 27 







They took the [idolatrous] things that Micah had made, and his priest, and they came to Laish, to a people who were quiet and secure; and they struck them with the edge of the sword and burned the city with fire. 















###### 28 







And there was no one to rescue them because it was far from Sidon and they had no dealings with anyone. It was in the valley which belongs to Beth-rehob. And they rebuilt the city and lived in it. 















###### 29 







They named the city Dan, after Dan their forefather who was born to Israel (Jacob); however, the original name of the city was Laish. 















###### 30 







The [tribe of] the sons of Dan set up the image [of silver-plated wood] for themselves; and Jonathan the son of Gershom, the son of [^c]Moses, and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity _and_ exile from the land. 















###### 31 







So they set up for themselves Micah's [silver-plated wooden] image which he had made, _and kept it_ throughout the time that the house (tabernacle) of God was at Shiloh. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

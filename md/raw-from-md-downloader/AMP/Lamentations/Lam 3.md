# Lamentations 3

***
















###### 1 







I am [Jeremiah] the man who has seen affliction Because of the rod of His wrath. 















###### 2 







He has led me and made me walk In darkness and not in light. 















###### 3 







Surely He has turned His hand against me Repeatedly all the day. 















###### 4 







He has caused my flesh and my skin to waste away; He has shattered my bones. 















###### 5 







He has besieged and surrounded me with bitterness and hardship. 















###### 6 







He has made me live in dark places Like those who have long been dead. 















###### 7 







He walled me in so that I cannot get out; He has weighted down my chain. 















###### 8 







Even when I cry out and shout for help, He shuts out my prayer. 















###### 9 







He has blocked my ways with cut stone; He has made my paths crooked. 















###### 10 







He is to me like a bear lying in wait, And like a lion [hiding] in secret places. 















###### 11 







He has turned aside my ways and torn me in pieces; He has made me desolate. 















###### 12 







He has bent His bow And set me as a target for the arrow. 















###### 13 







He has caused the arrows of His quiver To enter my inner parts. 















###### 14 







I have become the [object of] ridicule to all my people, And [the subject of] their _mocking_ song all the day. 















###### 15 







He has filled me with bitterness; He has made me drunk with wormwood (bitterness). 















###### 16 







He has broken my teeth with gravel; He has [covered me with ashes and] made me cower in the dust. 















###### 17 







My soul has been cast far away from peace; I have forgotten happiness. 















###### 18 







So I say, "My strength has perished And so has my hope _and_ expectation from the LORD." ## Hope of Relief in God's Mercy 















###### 19 







Remember [O LORD] my affliction and my wandering, the wormwood and the gall (bitterness). 















###### 20 







My soul _continually_ remembers them And is bowed down within me. 















###### 21 







But this I call to mind, Therefore I have hope. 















###### 22 







It is because of the Lord's lovingkindnesses that we are not consumed, Because His [tender] compassions never fail. 















###### 23 







They are new every morning; Great _and_ beyond measure is Your faithfulness. 















###### 24 







"The LORD is my portion _and_ my inheritance," says my soul; "Therefore I have hope in Him _and_ wait expectantly for Him." 















###### 25 







The LORD is good to those who wait [confidently] for Him, To those who seek Him [on the authority of God's word]. 















###### 26 







It is good that one waits quietly For the salvation of the LORD. 















###### 27 







It is good for a man that he should bear The yoke [of godly discipline] in his youth. 















###### 28 







Let him sit alone [in hope] and keep quiet, Because God has laid it on him [for his benefit]. 















###### 29 







Let him put his mouth in the dust [in recognition of his unworthiness]; There may yet be hope. 















###### 30 







Let him give his cheek to the one who strikes him; Let him be filled with reproach. 















###### 31 







For the Lord will not reject forever, 















###### 32 







For if He causes grief, Then He will have compassion According to His abundant lovingkindness _and_ tender mercy. 















###### 33 







For He does not afflict willingly _and_ from His heart Or grieve the children of men. 















###### 34 







To trample _and_ crush under His feet All the prisoners of the land, 















###### 35 







To deprive a man of justice In the presence of the Most High, 















###### 36 







To defraud a man in his lawsuit-- The Lord does not approve of these things. 















###### 37 







Who is there who speaks and it comes to pass, Unless the Lord has authorized _and_ commanded it? 















###### 38 







Is it not from the mouth of the Most High That both adversity (misfortune) and good (prosperity, happiness) proceed? 















###### 39 







Why should any living mortal, or any man, Complain [of punishment] in view of his sins? 















###### 40 







Let us test and examine our ways, And let us return to the LORD. 















###### 41 







Let us lift up our hearts and our hands [in prayer] Toward God in heaven; 















###### 42 







We have transgressed and rebelled, You have not pardoned. 















###### 43 







You have covered _Yourself_ with anger And pursued us; You have slain [without pity] and have not spared. 















###### 44 







You have covered Yourself with a cloud So that no prayer can pass through. 















###### 45 







You have made us scum and refuse Among the peoples (Gentile nations). 















###### 46 







All our enemies have gaped at us. 















###### 47 







Panic and pitfall (traps, danger) have come on us, Devastation and destruction. 















###### 48 







My eyes overflow with streams of tears Because of the destruction of the daughter of my people (Jerusalem). 















###### 49 







My eyes overflow unceasingly, Without stopping, 















###### 50 







Until the LORD looks down And sees from heaven. 















###### 51 







My eyes [see things that] bring pain to my soul Because of all the daughters of my city. 















###### 52 







Without cause my enemies Hunted me down like a bird; 















###### 53 







They silenced me in the pit And placed a stone over me. 















###### 54 







The waters ran down on my head; I said, "I am cut off (destroyed)!" 















###### 55 







I called on Your name, O LORD, Out of the lowest pit. 















###### 56 







You have heard my voice, "Do not hide Your ear from my _prayer_ for relief, From my cry for help." 















###### 57 







You drew near on the day I called to You; You said, "Do not fear." 















###### 58 







O Lord, You have pleaded my soul's cause [You have guided my way and protected me]; You have rescued _and_ redeemed my life. 















###### 59 







O LORD, You have seen the wrong [done to me]; Judge my case. 















###### 60 







You have seen all their vengeance, All their schemes against me. 















###### 61 







You have heard their reproach, O LORD, And all their schemes against me. 















###### 62 







The lips and whispering of my assailants Are against me all day long. 















###### 63 







Look at their sitting and their rising [their actions and secret counsels]; I am their mocking song [the subject of their ridicule]. 















###### 64 







You will repay them, O LORD, According to the work of their hands. 















###### 65 







You will harden their hearts; Your curse will be upon them. 















###### 66 







You will pursue them in anger and destroy them From under the heavens of the LORD. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Lamentations 4

***
















###### 1 







How dark _and_ dim the gold has become, How the pure gold has changed! The sacred stones [of the temple] are poured out _and_ scattered At the head of every street. 















###### 2 







The [noble and] precious sons of Zion, [Once] worth their weight in fine gold, How they are regarded [merely] as earthen jars, The work of a potter's hands! 















###### 3 







Even the jackals offer the breast, They nurse their young; But the daughter of my people has become cruel Like ostriches in the wilderness [that desert their young]. 















###### 4 







The tongue of the infant clings To the roof of its mouth because of thirst; The little ones ask for food, But no one gives it to them. 















###### 5 







Those who feasted on delicacies Are perishing in the streets; Those reared in purple [as nobles] Embrace ash heaps. 















###### 6 







For the [punishment of the] wickedness of the daughter of my people [Jerusalem] Is greater than the [punishment for the] sin of Sodom, Which was overthrown in a moment, And no hands were turned toward her [to offer help]. 















###### 7 







Her princes were purer than snow, They were whiter than milk [in appearance]; They were more ruddy in body than rubies, Their polishing was like lapis lazuli (sapphire). 















###### 8 







Their appearance is [now] blacker than soot [because of the prolonged famine]; They are not recognized in the streets; Their skin clings to their bones; It is withered, and it has become [dry] like wood. 















###### 9 







Those killed with the sword Are more fortunate than those killed with hunger; For the hungry pine _and_ ebb away, For the lack of the fruits of the field. 















###### 10 







The hands of compassionate women Boiled their own children; They became food for them Because of the destruction of the daughter of my people [Judah]. 















###### 11 







The LORD has fulfilled His wrath; He has poured out His fierce anger And has kindled a fire in Zion That has consumed her foundations. 















###### 12 







The kings of the earth did not believe, Nor did any of the inhabitants of the earth, That the adversary (oppressor) and enemy Could enter the gates of Jerusalem. 















###### 13 







Because of the sins of her [counterfeit] prophets And the wickedness of her [unfaithful] priests, Who have shed in her midst The blood of the just _and_ righteous; 















###### 14 







They wandered, blind, in the streets; They were defiled with blood So that no one could touch their garments. 















###### 15 







People cried to them, "Go away! Unclean! Depart! Depart! Do not touch!" So they fled, then they wandered [as fugitives]; People among the nations said, "They shall not stay here any longer _with us_." 















###### 16 







The presence of the LORD scattered them [among the nations]; He will not continue to look after them. They did not honor the priests; They did not favor the elders. 















###### 17 







[And as for us,] yet our eyes failed, Looking in vain for help. Watching [from the towers] we watched For a nation that could not save. 















###### 18 







The enemy hunted our steps, So that we could not walk in our streets; Our end drew near, Our days were finished For our end had come. 















###### 19 







Our pursuers were swifter Than the eagles of the sky; They pursued us on the mountains, They waited in ambush for us in the wilderness. 















###### 20 







The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD [our king], Was captured in their snares, He of whom we had said, "Under his shadow We shall live among the nations." 















###### 21 







Rejoice and be glad, O Daughter of Edom, Who lives in the land of Uz. But the cup [of the wine of God's wrath] will pass to you as well; You will become drunk and make yourself naked. 















###### 22 







_The punishment_ of your sin has been completed, O Daughter of Zion; The LORD will no longer send you into exile. But He will punish your sin, O Daughter of Edom; He will expose your sins. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

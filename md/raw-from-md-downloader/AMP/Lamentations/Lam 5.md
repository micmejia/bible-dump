# Lamentations 5

***
















###### 1 







O LORD, remember what has come upon us; Look, and see our reproach (national disgrace)! 















###### 2 







Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, Our houses to foreigners. 















###### 3 







We have become orphans without a father; Our mothers are like widows. 















###### 4 







We have to pay for our drinking water; Our wood comes to us at a price. 















###### 5 







Our pursuers are at our necks; We are worn out, there is no rest for us. 















###### 6 







We have given the hand [as a pledge of fidelity and submission] to Egypt and Assyria to get enough bread. 















###### 7 







Our fathers sinned, and are no more; It is [^a]we who have carried their sin. 















###### 8 







Servants rule over us; There is no one to rescue us out of their hand. 















###### 9 







We get our bread at the risk of our lives Because of the sword [of the Arabs] in the wilderness [who may attack if we go out to harvest the crop]. 















###### 10 







Our skin is as hot as [the heat of] an oven Because of the burning heat of [the fever of] famine. 















###### 11 







They ravished the women in Zion, The virgins in the cities of Judah. 















###### 12 







Princes were hung by their hands; Elders were not respected. 















###### 13 







Young men worked at the grinding mill, And boys fell [staggering] under loads of wood. 















###### 14 







Elders are gone from the gate; Young men from their music. 















###### 15 







The joy of our hearts has ended; Our dancing has been turned into mourning. 















###### 16 







The crown has fallen from our head [our honor is covered with dust]! Woe to us, for we have sinned! 















###### 17 







Because of this our heart is faint, Because of these things our eyes are dim. 















###### 18 







As for Mount Zion, which lies desolate, Foxes _and_ the jackals prowl over it. 















###### 19 







But You, O LORD, reign forever; Your throne endures from generation to [all] generations. 















###### 20 







Why do You forget us forever? Why do You forsake us so long? 















###### 21 







Return us to You, O LORD, so that we may be restored; Renew our days as of old, 















###### 22

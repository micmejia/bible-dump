[^b]: Leviticus 18:6 This Hebrew euphemism for sexual relations occurs in each verse in the passage. [^c]: Leviticus 18:7 The father’s _nakedness_ is a reference to his wife in her role as his sexual partner, i.e. the _nakedness_ that belongs to him alone by virtue of their marriage (cf 1 Cor 7:4). Otherwise, the literal meaning would refer to intimate relations with the father himself, including homosexuality. The text itself states that this is not the meaning, especially in 20:11a (_The man who lies...has uncovered his father’s nakedness)_.

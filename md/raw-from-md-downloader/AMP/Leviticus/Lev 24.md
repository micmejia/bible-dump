# Leviticus 24

***
















###### 1 







Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 















###### 2 







"Command the children of Israel to bring to you clear oil from beaten olives for the light [of the golden lampstand], to make a lamp burn continually. 















###### 3 







Outside the veil of the Testimony [between the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place] in the Tent of Meeting, Aaron shall always keep the lamps [^a]burning before the LORD from evening until morning; it shall be a permanent statute throughout your generations. 















###### 4 







He shall keep the lamps burning on the pure _gold_ lampstand before the LORD continually. 















###### 5 







"Then you shall take fine flour and bake twelve cakes (bread of the Presence, showbread) with it; two-tenths of _an ephah_ shall be in each cake (loaf). 















###### 6 







You shall set the bread of the Presence (showbread) in two rows, six in a row, on the pure _gold_ table before the LORD. 















###### 7 







You shall put pure frankincense [in two censers, one] beside each row, so that it may be with the bread as a memorial portion, an offering by fire to the LORD. 















###### 8 







Every Sabbath day Aaron shall arrange the showbread before the LORD continually; it is an everlasting covenant for the Israelites. 















###### 9 







The bread of the Presence shall be for Aaron and his sons, and they shall eat it in a sacred place, for it is for Aaron a most holy portion of the offerings by fire to the LORD, his portion forever." 















###### 10 







Now the son of an Israelite woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the Israelites, and he and a man of Israel quarreled _and_ struggled with each other in the camp. 















###### 11 







The Israelite woman's son blasphemed the Name [of the LORD] and cursed. So they brought him to Moses. **(**Now his mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.**)** 















###### 12 







They put him in custody until the will _and_ command of the LORD might be made clear to them. 















###### 13 







Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 















###### 14 







"Bring the one who has cursed [the LORD] outside the camp, and let all who heard him lay their hands on his head [as witnesses to his guilt]; then let all the congregation stone him. 















###### 15 







You shall speak to the Israelites, saying, 'Whoever curses his God will bear his sin [through his own death]. 















###### 16 







Further, the one who blasphemes the name of the LORD shall most certainly be put to death; all the congregation shall stone him. The stranger as well as the native-born shall be put to death when he blasphemes the Name [of the LORD]. ## "An Eye for an Eye" 















###### 17 







'If a man takes the life of any human being [unlawfully], he shall most certainly be put to death. 















###### 18 







The one who kills an animal shall replace it, animal for animal. 















###### 19 







If a man injures his neighbor (fellow citizen), whatever he has done shall be done to him: 















###### 20 







fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; just as he has injured a man, so shall the same be done to him. 















###### 21 







The one who kills an animal shall replace it; but he who kills a human being [unlawfully] shall be put to death. 















###### 22 







You shall have one standard of law for the stranger _among you_ as well as for the native, for I am the LORD your God.'" 















###### 23 







Then Moses spoke to the Israelites, and they brought the one who had cursed [the LORD] outside the camp and stoned him with stones. Thus the Israelites did just as the LORD had commanded Moses. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

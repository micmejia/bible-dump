###### 2 







He shall lay his hand on the head of his offering [transferring symbolically his guilt to the sacrifice] and kill it at the doorway of the Tent of Meeting; and Aaron's sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood around on the altar. 















###### 3 







From the sacrifice of the peace offerings, an offering by fire to the LORD, he shall present the fat that covers the entrails, and all the fat which is on the entrails,

and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them at the loins, and the [^a]lobe of the liver which he shall remove with the kidneys. 















###### 5 







Aaron's sons shall offer it up in smoke on the altar [placing it] on the burnt offering which is on the wood that is on the fire. It is an offering by fire, a sweet _and_ soothing aroma to the LORD.

If his peace offering to the LORD is an animal from the flock, male or female, he shall offer the animal without blemish.

The priest shall offer it up in smoke on the altar as food, an offering by fire to the LORD. 















###### 12 







'If his offering is a goat, he shall present it before the LORD, 















###### 13 







and he shall lay his hand on its head [transferring symbolically his guilt to the sacrifice], and kill it before the Tent of Meeting; and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle its blood around on the altar.

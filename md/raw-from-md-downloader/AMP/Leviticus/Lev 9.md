# Leviticus 9

***
















###### 1 







And it happened on the eighth day that Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel; 















###### 2 







and he said to Aaron, "Take a bull calf as a sin offering and a ram as a burnt offering, [each] without blemish, and offer _both_ before the LORD. 















###### 3 







Then say to the Israelites, 'Take a male goat as a sin offering, and a calf and a lamb, both one year old, without blemish, as a burnt offering, 















###### 4 







and a bull and a ram as peace offerings to sacrifice before the LORD, and a grain offering mixed with [olive] oil, for today the LORD will appear to you.'" 















###### 5 







So they took what Moses had commanded to the front of the Tent of Meeting, and all the congregation approached and stood before the LORD. 















###### 6 







Moses said, "This is the thing which the LORD has commanded you to do, so that the glory of the LORD may appear to you." 















###### 7 







Moses said to Aaron, "Approach the altar and present your sin offering and your burnt offering and make atonement for yourself and for the people; and present the offering of the people and make atonement for them, just as the LORD has commanded." 















###### 8 







So Aaron approached the altar and killed the calf as the sin offering, which was _designated_ for himself. 















###### 9 







The sons of Aaron presented the blood to him; he dipped his finger in the blood and put _some of it_ on the horns of the altar, and poured out the _rest of the_ blood at the altar's base; 















###### 10 







but the fat, the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver from the sin offering he offered up in smoke on the altar, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. 















###### 11 







And Aaron burned the meat and the hide in the fire outside the camp. 















###### 12 







Then he killed the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons handed the blood to him and he sprinkled it around on the altar. 















###### 13 







They brought the burnt offering to him piece by piece, with the head, and Aaron offered them up in smoke on the altar. 















###### 14 







He also washed the entrails and the legs, and offered them up in smoke with the burnt offering on the altar. 















###### 15 







Then Aaron presented the people's offering. He took the goat for the sin offering of the people, and killed it and offered it for sin, as _he did_ the first. 















###### 16 







He also presented the burnt offering and offered it according to the ordinance. 















###### 17 







Next Aaron presented the grain offering and took a handful of it and offered it up in smoke on the altar in addition to the burnt offering of the morning. 















###### 18 







He also killed the bull and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings which was for the people; and Aaron's sons handed the blood to him and he sprinkled it around on the altar, 















###### 19 







As for the portions of fat from the bull and from the ram--the fat tail, and the fat covering the internal organs, and the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver-- 















###### 20 







they now put the portions of fat on the breasts; and Aaron offered the fat up in smoke on the altar. 















###### 21 







But the breasts and the right thigh Aaron presented as a wave offering before the LORD, just as Moses had commanded. 















###### 22 







Then Aaron lifted his hands toward the people and blessed them, and came down [from the altar of burnt offering] after presenting the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offerings. 















###### 23 







Moses and Aaron went into the Tent of Meeting, and when they came out they blessed the people, and the glory _and_ brilliance of the LORD [the Shekinah cloud] appeared to all the people [as promised]. 















###### 24 







Then fire came out from before the LORD and consumed the burnt offering and the portions of fat on the altar; and when all the people saw it, they shouted and fell face downward [in awe and worship]. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Luke 10

***
















###### 1 







Now after this the Lord appointed [^a]seventy others, and sent them out ahead of Him, two by two, into every city and place where He was about to go. 















###### 2 







He was saying to them, "The harvest is abundant [for there are many who need to hear the good news about salvation], but the workers [those available to proclaim the message of salvation] are few. Therefore, [prayerfully] ask the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into His harvest. 















###### 3 







Go your way; listen carefully: I am sending you out like lambs among wolves. 















###### 4 







Do not carry a money belt, a provision bag, or [extra] sandals; and do not [^b]greet anyone along the way [who would delay you]. 















###### 5 







Whatever house you enter, first say, '[^c]Peace [that is, a blessing of well-being and prosperity, the favor of God] to this house.' 















###### 6 







And if anyone of peace is there [someone who is sweet-spirited and hospitable], your [blessing of] peace will rest on him; but if not, it will return to you. 















###### 7 







Stay in that house, eating and drinking what they provide, for the laborer is worthy of his wages. Do not move from house to house. 















###### 8 







Whenever you go into a city and they welcome you, eat what is set before you; 















###### 9 







and heal those in it who are sick [authenticating your message], and say to them, 'The kingdom of God has come near to you.' 















###### 10 







But whatever city you enter and they do not welcome you, go out into its streets and say, 















###### 11 







'Even the dust of your city which clings to our feet we wipe off _in protest_ against you [breaking all ties]; yet understand this, that the kingdom of God has come near [and you rejected it].' 















###### 12 







I tell you, it will be more bearable in that day [of judgment] for Sodom than for that city. 















###### 13 







"Woe (judgment is coming) to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented _and_ changed their minds long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes [to show deep regret for sin]. 















###### 14 







However, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you. 















###### 15 







And you, Capernaum, will not be exalted to heaven, will you? You will descend to Hades (the realm of the dead). 















###### 16 







"The one who listens to you listens to Me; and the one who rejects you rejects Me; and the one who rejects Me rejects Him [My heavenly Father] who sent Me." ## The Joyous Results 















###### 17 







The seventy returned with joy, saying, "Lord, even the demons are subject to us in Your name." 















###### 18 







He said to them, "I watched Satan fall from heaven like [a flash of] lightning. 















###### 19 







Listen carefully: I have given you authority [that you now possess] to tread on [^d]serpents and scorpions, and [the ability to exercise authority] over all the power of the enemy (Satan); and nothing will [in any way] harm you. 















###### 20 







Nevertheless do not rejoice at this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are recorded in heaven." 















###### 21 







In that very hour He was overjoyed _and_ rejoiced greatly in the Holy Spirit, and He said, "I praise You, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things [relating to salvation] from the [^e]wise and intelligent, and have revealed them to infants [the childlike and untaught]. Yes, Father, for this way was [Your gracious will and choice, and was] well-pleasing in Your sight. 















###### 22 







All things have been transferred _and_ turned over to Me by My Father and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, or who the Father is except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son wishes to reveal Him." 















###### 23 







Then turning to His disciples, Jesus said privately, "Blessed [joyful, spiritually enlightened, and favored by God] are the eyes which see what you see, 















###### 24 







for I say to you that many prophets and kings longed to see what you see, and they did not see it; and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it." 















###### 25 







And a certain lawyer [an expert in Mosaic Law] stood up to test Him, saying, "Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?" 















###### 26 







Jesus said to him, "What is written in the Law? How do you read it?" 















###### 27 







And he replied, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself." 















###### 28 







Jesus said to him, "You have answered correctly; do this _habitually_ and you will live." 















###### 29 







But he, wishing to justify _and_ vindicate himself, asked Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?" ## Parable of the Good Samaritan 















###### 30 







Jesus replied, "A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he encountered robbers, who stripped him of his clothes [and belongings], beat him, and went their way [unconcerned], leaving him half dead. 















###### 31 







Now by coincidence a priest was going down that road, and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. 















###### 32 







Likewise a Levite also came down to the place and saw him, and passed by on the other side [of the road]. 















###### 33 







But a Samaritan (foreigner), who was traveling, came upon him; and when he saw him, he was deeply moved with compassion [for him], 















###### 34 







and went to him and bandaged up his wounds, pouring oil and wine on _them_ [to sooth and disinfect the injuries]; and he put him on his own pack-animal, and brought him to an inn and took care of him. 















###### 35 







On the next day he took out two denarii (two days' wages) and gave them to the innkeeper, and said, 'Take care of him; and whatever more you spend, I will repay you when I return.' 















###### 36 







Which of these three do you think proved himself a neighbor to the man who encountered the robbers?" 















###### 37 







He answered, "The one who showed compassion _and_ mercy to him." Then Jesus said to him, "Go and _constantly_ do the same." ## Martha and Mary 















###### 38 







Now while they were on their way, Jesus entered a village [called Bethany], and a woman named Martha welcomed Him into her home. 















###### 39 







She had a sister named Mary, who seated herself at the Lord's feet and was _continually_ listening to His teaching. 















###### 40 







But Martha was very busy _and_ distracted with all of her serving responsibilities; and she approached Him and said, "Lord, is it of no concern to You that my sister has left me to do the serving alone? Tell her to help me _and_ do her part." 















###### 41 







But the Lord replied to her, "Martha, Martha, you are worried and bothered _and_ anxious about so many things; 















###### 42 







but _only_ one thing is necessary, for Mary has chosen the good part [that which is to her advantage], which will not be taken away from her." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Luke 15

***
















###### 1 







Now all the tax collectors and sinners [including non-observant Jews] were coming near Jesus to listen to Him. 















###### 2 







Both the Pharisees and the scribes _began_ muttering _and_ complaining, saying, "This man accepts _and_ welcomes sinners and eats with them." 















###### 3 







So He told them this parable: 















###### 4 







"What man among you, if he has a hundred sheep and loses one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the one which is lost, [searching] until he finds it? 















###### 5 







And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing. 















###### 6 







And when he gets home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, because I have found my lost sheep!' 















###### 7 







I tell you, in the same way there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who have no need of repentance. ## The Lost Coin 















###### 8 







"Or what woman, if she has ten silver coins [each one equal to a day's wages] and loses one coin, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it? 















###### 9 







And when she has found it, she calls together her [women] friends and neighbors, saying, 'Rejoice with me, because I found the lost coin!' 















###### 10 







In the same way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents [that is, changes his inner self--his old way of thinking, regrets past sins, lives his life in a way that proves repentance; and seeks God's purpose for his life]." ## The Prodigal Son 















###### 11 







Then He said, "A certain man had two sons. 















###### 12 







The younger of them [inappropriately] said to his father, 'Father, give me the share of the property that falls to me.' So he divided the estate between them. 















###### 13 







A few days later, the younger son gathered together everything [that he had] and traveled to a distant country, and there he wasted his fortune in reckless _and_ immoral living. 















###### 14 







Now when he had spent everything, a severe famine occurred in that country, and he began to do without _and_ be in need. 















###### 15 







So he went and forced himself on one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into his fields to [^a]feed pigs. 















###### 16 







He would have gladly eaten the [carob] pods that the pigs were eating [but they could not satisfy his hunger], and no one was giving _anything_ to him. 















###### 17 







But when he [finally] came to his senses, he said, 'How many of my father's hired men have more than enough food, while I am dying here of hunger! 















###### 18 







I will get up and go to my father, and I will say to him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight. 















###### 19 







I am no longer worthy to be called your son; [just] treat me like one of your hired men."' 















###### 20 







So he got up and came to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was moved with compassion _for him_, and ran and embraced him and kissed him. 















###### 21 







And the son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight; I am no longer worthy to be called your son.' 















###### 22 







But the father said to his servants, 'Quickly bring out the best robe [for the guest of honor] and put it on him; and give him a [^b]ring for his hand, and sandals for his feet. 















###### 23 







And bring the fattened calf and slaughter it, and let us [invite everyone and] feast and celebrate; 















###### 24 







for this son of mine was [as good as] dead and is alive again; he was lost and has been found.' So they began to celebrate. 















###### 25 







"Now his older son was in the field; and when he returned and approached the house, he heard music and dancing. 















###### 26 







So he summoned one of the servants and _began_ asking what this [celebration] meant. 















###### 27 







And he said to him, 'Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has received him back safe and sound.' 















###### 28 







But the elder brother became angry _and_ deeply resentful and was not willing to go in; and his father came out and _began_ pleading with him. 















###### 29 







But he said to his father, 'Look! These many years I have served you, and I have never neglected _or_ disobeyed your command. Yet you have never given me [so much as] a young goat, so that I might celebrate with my friends; 















###### 30 







but when this [other] son of yours arrived, who has devoured your estate with immoral women, you slaughtered that fattened calf for him!' 















###### 31 







The father said to him, 'Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours. 















###### 32 







But it was fitting to celebrate and rejoice, for this brother of yours was [as good as] dead and _has begun_ to live. He was lost and has been found.'" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

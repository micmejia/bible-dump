# Luke 16

***
















###### 1 







Now Jesus was also saying to the disciples, "There was a certain rich man who had a manager [of his estate], and accusations [against this man] were brought to him, that this man was squandering his [master's] possessions. 















###### 2 







So he called him and said to him, 'What is this I hear about you? Give an accounting of your management [of my affairs], for you can no longer be [my] manager.' 















###### 3 







The manager [of the estate] said to himself, 'What will I do, since my master is taking the management away from me? I am not strong enough to dig [for a living], and I am ashamed to beg. 















###### 4 







I know what I will do, so that when I am removed from the management, people [who are my master's debtors] will welcome me into their homes.' 















###### 5 







So he summoned his master's debtors one by one, and he said to the first, 'How much do you owe my master?' 















###### 6 







He said, 'A hundred [^a]measures of [olive] oil.' And he said to him, 'Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write [^b]fifty.' 















###### 7 







Then he said to another, 'And how much do you owe?' He said, 'A hundred [^c]measures of wheat.' He said to him, 'Take your bill, and write eighty.' 















###### 8 







And his master commended the unjust manager [not for his misdeeds, but] because he had acted shrewdly [by preparing for his future unemployment]; for the sons of this age [the non-believers] are shrewder in relation to their own kind [that is, to the ways of the secular world] than are the sons of light [the believers]. 















###### 9 







And I tell you [learn from this], make friends for yourselves [for eternity] by means of the [^d]wealth of unrighteousness [that is, use material resources as a way to further the work of God], so that when it runs out, they will welcome you into the eternal dwellings. 















###### 10 







"He who is faithful in a very little thing is also faithful in much; and he who is dishonest in a very little thing is also dishonest in much. 















###### 11 







Therefore if you have not been faithful in the _use of_ earthly wealth, who will entrust the true _riches_ to you? 















###### 12 







And if you have not been faithful in _the use of_ that [earthly wealth] which belongs to another [whether God or man, and of which you are a trustee], who will give you that which is your own? 















###### 13 







No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will stand devotedly by the one and despise the other. You cannot serve _both_ God and mammon [that is, your earthly possessions or anything else you trust in and rely on instead of God]." 















###### 14 







Now the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, were listening to all these things and were sneering _and_ ridiculing Him. 















###### 15 







So He said to them, "You are the ones who declare yourselves just _and_ upright in the sight of men, but God knows your hearts [your thoughts, your desires, your secrets]; for that which is highly esteemed among men is detestable in the sight of God. 















###### 16 







"The Law and the [writings of the] Prophets were proclaimed until John; since then the gospel of the kingdom of God has been _and_ continues to be preached, and everyone tries forcefully to go into it. 















###### 17 







Yet it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for a single stroke of a letter of the Law to fail _and_ become void. 















###### 18 







"Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and he who marries one who is divorced from her husband commits adultery. ## The Rich Man and Lazarus 















###### 19 







"Now there was a certain rich man who was habitually dressed in expensive purple and fine linen, and celebrated _and_ lived joyously in splendor every day. 















###### 20 







And a poor man named Lazarus, was laid at his gate, covered with sores. 















###### 21 







He [eagerly] longed to eat the _crumbs_ which fell from the rich man's table. Besides, even the dogs were coming and licking his sores. 















###### 22 







Now it happened that the poor man died and his spirit was carried away by the angels to Abraham's [^e]bosom (paradise); and the rich man also died and was buried. 















###### 23 







In Hades (the realm of the dead), being in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away and Lazarus in his bosom (paradise). 















###### 24 







And he cried out, 'Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus so that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in severe agony in this flame.' 















###### 25 







But Abraham said, 'Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things [all the comforts and delights], and Lazarus likewise bad things [all the discomforts and distresses]; but now he is comforted here [in paradise], while you are in severe agony. 















###### 26 







And besides all this, between us and you [people] a great chasm has been fixed, so that those who want to come over from here to you will not be able, and none may cross over from there to us.' 















###### 27 







So the rich man said, 'Then, father [Abraham], I beg you to send Lazarus to my father's house-- 















###### 28 







for I have five brothers--in order that he may _solemnly_ warn them _and_ witness to them, so that they too will not come to this place of torment.' 















###### 29 







But Abraham said, 'They have [the Scriptures given by] Moses and the [writings of the] Prophets; let them listen to them.' 















###### 30 







He replied, 'No, father Abraham, but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent [they will change their old way of thinking and seek God and His righteousness].' 















###### 31 







And he said to him, 'If they do not listen to [the messages of] Moses and the Prophets, they will not be persuaded even if someone rises from the dead.'" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

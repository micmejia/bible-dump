# Luke 17

***
















###### 1 







Jesus said to His disciples, "Stumbling blocks [temptations and traps set to lure one to sin] are sure to come, but woe (judgment is coming) to him through whom they come! 















###### 2 







It would be better for him if a millstone [as large as one turned by a donkey] were hung around his neck and he were hurled into the sea, than for him to cause one of these [^a]little ones to stumble [in sin and lose faith]. 















###### 3 







Pay attention _and_ always be on guard [looking out for one another]! If your brother sins _and_ disregards God's precepts, solemnly warn him; and if he repents _and_ changes, forgive him. 















###### 4 







Even if he sins against you seven times a day, and returns to you seven times and says, 'I repent,' you must forgive him [that is, give up resentment and consider the offense recalled and annulled]." 















###### 5 







The apostles said to the Lord, "Increase our faith [our ability to confidently trust in God and in His power]." 















###### 6 







And the Lord said, "If you [^b]have [confident, abiding] faith in God [even as small] as a mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree [which has very strong roots], 'Be pulled up by the roots and be planted in the sea'; and [if the request was in agreement with the will of God] it would have obeyed you. 















###### 7 







"Which of you who has a servant plowing or tending sheep will say to him when he comes in from the field, 'Come at once and sit down to eat?' 















###### 8 







Will he not instead say to him, 'Prepare something for me to eat, and _appropriately_ clothe yourself [for service] and serve me while I eat and drink; then afterward you may eat and drink?' 















###### 9 







He does not thank the servant just because he did what he was ordered to do, does he? 















###### 10 







So you too, when you have done everything that was assigned _and_ commanded you, say, 'We are unworthy servants [undeserving of praise or a reward, for we have not gone beyond our obligation]; we have _merely_ done what we ought to do.'" ## Ten Lepers Cleansed 















###### 11 







While Jesus was on the way to Jerusalem, He was passing [along the border] between Samaria and Galilee. 















###### 12 







As He entered a village, He was met by ten lepers who stood at a distance; 















###### 13 







and they raised their voices and called out, "Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!" 















###### 14 







When He saw them, He said to them, "Go and show yourselves to the priests." And as they went, they were [miraculously] healed _and_ made clean. 















###### 15 







One of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, glorifying _and_ praising _and_ honoring God with a loud voice; 















###### 16 







and he lay face downward at Jesus' feet, thanking Him [over and over]. He was a [^c]Samaritan. 















###### 17 







Then Jesus asked, "Were not ten [of you] cleansed? Where are the [other] nine? 















###### 18 







Was there no one found to return and to give thanks _and_ praise to God, except this foreigner?" 















###### 19 







Jesus said to him, "Get up and go [on your way]. Your faith [your personal trust in Me and your confidence in God's power] has restored you to health." 















###### 20 







Now having been asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, He replied, "The kingdom of God is not coming with signs to be observed _or_ with a visible display; 















###### 21 







nor will people say, 'Look! Here it is!' or, 'There it is!' For the kingdom of God is among you [because of My presence]." ## Second Coming Foretold 















###### 22 







Then He said to the disciples, "The time will come when you will long to see [even] one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it. 















###### 23 







They will say to you, 'Look [the Messiah is] there!' _or_ 'Look [He is] here!' Do not go away [to see Him], and do not run after _them_. 















###### 24 







For just like the lightning, when it flashes out of one part [^d]of the sky, gives light to the other part [^e]of the sky, so [visible] will the Son of Man be in His day. 















###### 25 







But first He must suffer many things and be repudiated _and_ rejected _and_ considered unfit [to be the Messiah] by this [unbelieving] generation. 















###### 26 







And just as it was in the days of Noah, so it will be in the [^f]time of [the second coming of] the Son of Man: 















###### 27 







the people were [^g]eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, they were being given in marriage, [they were indifferent to God] until the day that Noah went into the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all. 















###### 28 







It was the same as it was in the days of Lot. People were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling, they were planting, they were building [carrying on business as usual, without regard for their sins]; 















###### 29 







but on the [very] day that Lot left Sodom it rained fire and brimstone (burning sulfur) from heaven and destroyed them all. 















###### 30 







It will be just the same on the day that the Son of Man is revealed. 















###### 31 







On that day, whoever is on the housetop, with his belongings in the house, must not come down [and go inside] to take them out; and likewise whoever is in the field must not turn back. 















###### 32 







Remember [what happened to] Lot's wife [when she looked back]! 















###### 33 







Whoever seeks to save his [^h]life will [eventually] lose it [through death], and whoever loses _his life_ [in this world] will keep it [from the consequences of sin and separation from God]. 















###### 34 







I tell you, on that night [when Messiah comes again] there will be two [sleeping] in one bed; the [^i]one (the non-believer) will be taken [away in judgment] and the [^j]other (the believer) will be left. 















###### 35 







There will be two women grinding [at the mill] together; the [^k]one (the non-believer) will be taken [away in judgment] and the other (the believer) will be left. 















###### 36 







[^l][Two men will be in the field; [^m]one will be taken and the other will be left."] 















###### 37 







And they asked Him, "Where, Lord?" He answered, "Where the corpse is, there the vultures will be gathered." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: Luke 17:6 Jesus used this moment to emphasize that a person’s confident, abiding faith combined with God’s will and power can produce absolutely amazing results.

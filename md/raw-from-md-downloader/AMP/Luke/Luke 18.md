# Luke 18

***
















###### 1 







Now Jesus was telling the disciples a parable to make the point that at all times they ought to pray and not give up _and_ lose heart, 















###### 2 







saying, "In a certain city there was a judge who did not fear God and had no respect for man. 















###### 3 







There was a [desperate] widow in that city and she kept coming to him and saying, 'Give me justice _and_ legal protection from my adversary.' 















###### 4 







For a time he would not; but later he said to himself, 'Even though I do not fear God nor respect man, 















###### 5 







yet because this widow _continues_ to bother me, I will give her justice _and_ legal protection; otherwise [^a]by continually coming she [will be an intolerable annoyance and she] will wear me out.'" 















###### 6 







Then the Lord said, "Listen to what the unjust judge says! 















###### 7 







And will not [our just] God defend _and_ avenge His elect [His chosen ones] who cry out to Him day and night? Will He delay [in providing justice] on their behalf? 















###### 8 







I tell you that He will defend _and_ avenge them quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will He find [this kind of persistent] faith on the earth?" ## The Pharisee and the Tax Collector 















###### 9 







He also told this parable to some people who trusted in themselves _and_ were confident that they were righteous [posing outwardly as upright and in right standing with God], and who viewed others with contempt: 















###### 10 







"Two men went up into the temple [enclosure] to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. 















###### 11 







The Pharisee stood [ostentatiously] and began praying to himself [in a self-righteous way, saying]: 'God, I thank You that I am not like the rest of men--swindlers, unjust (dishonest), adulterers--or even like this tax collector. 















###### 12 







I fast twice a week; I pay tithes of all that I get.' 















###### 13 







But the tax collector, standing at a distance, would not even raise his eyes toward heaven, but was striking his chest [in humility and repentance], saying, 'God, be merciful _and_ gracious to me, the [especially wicked] sinner [that I am]!' 















###### 14 







I tell you, this man went to his home justified [forgiven of the guilt of sin and placed in right standing with God] rather than the other man; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself [forsaking self-righteous pride] will be exalted." 















###### 15 







Now they were also bringing their babies to Him, so that He would touch _and_ bless them, and when the disciples noticed it, they _began_ reprimanding them. 















###### 16 







But Jesus called them to Himself, saying [to the apostles], "Allow the children to come to Me, and do not forbid them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. 















###### 17 







I assure you _and_ most solemnly say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God [with faith and humility] like a child will not enter it at all." ## The Rich Young Ruler 















###### 18 







A certain ruler asked Him, "Good Teacher [You who are essentially and morally good], what shall I do to inherit eternal life [that is, eternal salvation in the Messiah's kingdom]?" 















###### 19 







Jesus said to him, "Why do you call Me good? No one is [essentially and morally] good except God alone. 















###### 20 







You know the commandments: 'Do not commit adultery, Do not murder, Do not steal, Do not testify falsely, Honor your father and your mother.'" 















###### 21 







He replied, "I have kept all these things from my youth." 















###### 22 







When Jesus heard this, He said to him, "You still lack one thing; sell everything that you have and distribute the money to the poor, and you will have [abundant] treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me [becoming My disciple, believing and trusting in Me and walking the same path of life that I walk]." 















###### 23 







But when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he was extremely rich. 















###### 24 







Jesus looked at him and said, "How difficult it is for those who are wealthy to enter the kingdom of God! 















###### 25 







For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man [who places his faith in wealth or status] to enter the kingdom of God." 















###### 26 







And those who heard it said, "[^b]Then who can be saved?" 















###### 27 







But He said, "The things that are impossible with people are possible with God." 















###### 28 







Peter said, "Look, we have left all [things--homes, families, businesses] and followed You." 















###### 29 







And He said to them, "I assure you _and_ most solemnly say to you, there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God, 















###### 30 







who will not receive many times as much in this present age and in the age to come, eternal life." 















###### 31 







Then taking the [^c]twelve [disciples] aside, He said to them, "Listen carefully: we are going up to Jerusalem, and all things that have been written through the prophets about the Son of Man will be fulfilled _and_ completed. 















###### 32 







He will be betrayed _and_ handed over to the Gentiles (Roman authorities), and will be mocked _and_ ridiculed and insulted _and_ abused and spit on, 















###### 33 







and after they have scourged Him, they will kill Him; and on the third day He will rise [from the dead]." 















###### 34 







But the disciples understood none of these things [about the approaching death and resurrection of Jesus]. This statement was hidden from them, and they did not grasp the [meaning of the] things that were said [by Jesus]. ## Bartimaeus Receives Sight 















###### 35 







As He was approaching Jericho [on His way to Jerusalem], it happened that a blind man was sitting beside the road begging. 















###### 36 







Now when he heard a crowd going by, he _began_ to ask what this was [about]. 















###### 37 







They told him, "Jesus of Nazareth is passing by." 















###### 38 







So he shouted out, saying, "Jesus, [^d]Son of David (Messiah), have mercy on me!" 















###### 39 







Those who were leading the way were sternly telling him to keep quiet; but he screamed all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me!" 















###### 40 







Then Jesus stopped and ordered that the blind man be led to Him; and when he came near, Jesus asked him, 















###### 41 







"What do you want Me to do for you?" He said, "Lord, let me regain my sight!" 















###### 42 







Jesus said to him, "Regain your sight; your [personal trust and confident] faith [in Me] has made you well." 















###### 43 







Immediately he regained his sight and _began_ following Jesus, glorifying _and_ praising _and_ honoring God. And all the people, when they saw it, praised God. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Luke 19

***
















###### 1 







Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through. 















###### 2 







And there was a man called Zaccheus; he was a chief tax collector [a superintendent to whom others reported], and he was rich. 















###### 3 







Zaccheus was trying to see who Jesus was, but he could not see [^a]because of the crowd, for he was short in stature. 















###### 4 







So he ran on ahead [of the crowd] and climbed up in a sycamore tree in order to see Him, for He was about to pass through that way. 















###### 5 







When Jesus reached the place, He looked up and said to him, "Zaccheus, hurry and come down, for today I must stay at your house." 















###### 6 







So Zaccheus hurried and came down, and welcomed Jesus with joy. 















###### 7 







When the people saw it, they all _began_ muttering [in discontent], "He has gone to be the guest of a man who is a [notorious] sinner." 















###### 8 







Zaccheus stopped and said to the Lord, "See, Lord, I am [now] giving half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anyone out of anything, I will give back four times as much." 















###### 9 







Jesus said to him, "Today salvation has come to this household, because he, too, is a [[^b]spiritual] son of Abraham; 















###### 10 







for the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost." ## Parable of Money Usage 















###### 11 







While they were listening to these things, Jesus went on to tell a parable, because He was near Jerusalem, and they assumed that the kingdom of God was going to appear immediately [as soon as He reached the city]. 















###### 12 







So He said, "A nobleman went to a distant country to obtain for himself a kingdom, and [then] to return. 















###### 13 







So he called ten of his servants, and gave them ten minas [one apiece, each equal to about a hundred days' wages] and said to them, 'Do business [with this] until I return.' 















###### 14 







But his citizens [the residents of his new kingdom] hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, 'We do not want this man to be a king over us.' 















###### 15 







When he returned, after receiving the kingdom, he ordered that these servants, to whom he had given the money, be called to him, that he might find out what business they had done. 















###### 16 







The first one came before him and said, 'Lord, your mina has made ten more minas.' 















###### 17 







And he said to him, 'Well done, good servant! Because you proved yourself faithful _and_ trustworthy in a very little thing, you shall [now] have authority over ten cities [in my kingdom].' 















###### 18 







The second one came and said, 'Lord, your mina has made five minas.' 















###### 19 







And he said to him also, 'And you shall take charge over five cities.' 















###### 20 







Then another came and said, 'Lord, here is your mina, which I have kept laid up in a handkerchief [for safekeeping]. 















###### 21 







I was [always] afraid of you, because you are a stern man; you pick up what you did not lay down and you reap what you did not sow.' 















###### 22 







He said to the servant, 'I will judge _and_ condemn you by your own words, you worthless servant! Did you [really] know that I was a stern man, picking up what I did not lay down and reaping what I did not sow? 















###### 23 







Then why did you not [at the very least] put my money in a bank? Then on my return, I would have collected it with interest.' 















###### 24 







Then he said to the bystanders, 'Take the mina away from him and give it to the one who has the ten minas.' 















###### 25 







And they said to him, 'Lord, he has ten minas _already_!' 















###### 26 







[Jesus explained,] 'I tell you that to everyone who has [because he valued his gifts from God and has used them wisely], _more_ will be given; but from the one who does not have [because he disregarded his gifts from God], even what he has will be taken away.' 















###### 27 







[The king ended by saying,] 'But as for these enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them, bring them here and kill them in my presence.'" ## The Triumphal Entry 















###### 28 







After saying these things, Jesus went on ahead [of them], going up to Jerusalem. 















###### 29 







When He approached Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount that is called Olivet, He sent two of the disciples, 















###### 30 







saying, "Go into the village ahead of you; there, as you enter, you will find a [donkey's] [^c]colt tied, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it here. 















###### 31 







If anybody asks you, 'Why are you untying the colt?' you will say, 'The Lord needs it.'" 















###### 32 







So those who were sent left and found the colt just as He had told them. 















###### 33 







As they were untying the colt, its owners asked them, "Why are you untying the colt?" 















###### 34 







They said, "The Lord needs it." 















###### 35 







They brought it to Jesus, and [^d]they threw their robes over the colt and put Jesus on it. 















###### 36 







As He rode along, people were spreading their coats on the road [as an act of homage before a king]. 















###### 37 







As soon as He was approaching [Jerusalem], near the descent of the Mount of Olives, the entire multitude of the disciples [all those who were or claimed to be His followers] began praising God [adoring Him enthusiastically and] joyfully with loud voices for all the miracles _and_ works of power that they had seen, 















###### 38 







shouting, "Blessed (celebrated, praised) is the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory (majesty, splendor) in the highest [heaven]!" 















###### 39 







Some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to Him, "Teacher, rebuke Your disciples [for shouting these Messianic praises]." 















###### 40 







Jesus replied, "I tell you, if these [people] keep silent, the stones will cry out [in praise]!" 















###### 41 







As He approached _Jerusalem_, He saw the city and wept over it [and the spiritual ignorance of its people], 















###### 42 







saying, "If [only] you had known on this day [of salvation], even you, the things which make for peace [and on which peace depends]! But now they have been hidden from your eyes. 















###### 43 







For a time [of siege] is coming when your enemies will put up a barricade [with pointed stakes] against you, and surround you [with armies] and hem you in on every side, 















###### 44 







and they will level you to the ground, you [Jerusalem] and your children within you. They will not leave in you one stone on another, all because you did not [come progressively to] recognize [from observation and personal experience] the time of your visitation [when God was gracious toward you and offered you salvation]." ## Traders Driven from the Temple 















###### 45 







Jesus went into the temple [enclosure] and began driving out those who were selling, 















###### 46 







saying to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be a house of prayer'; but you have made it a robbers' den." 















###### 47 







He was teaching day after day in the temple [porches and courts]; but the chief priests and scribes and the leading men among the people were seeking [a way] to put Him to death, 















###### 48 







and they could not find anything that they could do, for all the people [stayed close to Him and] were hanging on to [^e]every word He said. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

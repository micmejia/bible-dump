# Luke 22

***
















###### 1 







Now the Festival of Unleavened Bread, which is called the Passover, was approaching. 















###### 2 







The chief priests and the scribes were looking for a way to put Him to death; for they were afraid of the people [who listened devotedly to His teaching, and who respected His spiritual wisdom]. 















###### 3 







Then Satan entered Judas, the one called Iscariot, who was one of the twelve [disciples]. 















###### 4 







And he went away and discussed with the chief priests and officers how he might betray Him _and_ hand Him over to them. 















###### 5 







They were delighted and agreed with him to give him money. 















###### 6 







So he consented, and _began_ looking for a good opportunity to betray Jesus to them [at a time when He was] separated from the crowd [because the people might riot or stop them from seizing Him]. 















###### 7 







Then came the _preparation_ day of [^a]Unleavened Bread on which the Passover _lamb_ had to be sacrificed. 















###### 8 







So Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, "Go and prepare the Passover meal for us, so that we may eat it." 















###### 9 







They asked Him, "Where do You want us to prepare it?" 















###### 10 







He replied, "When you have entered the city, a [^b]man carrying an _earthen_ jar of water will meet you; follow him into the house that he enters. 















###### 11 







And say to the owner of the house, 'The Teacher asks, "Where is the guest room in which I may eat the Passover with My disciples?"' 















###### 12 







Then he will show you a large upstairs room, furnished [with carpets and dining couches]; prepare the meal there." 















###### 13 







They left and found it just as He had told them; and they prepared the Passover. ## The Lord's Supper 















###### 14 







When the hour [for the meal] had come, Jesus reclined _at the table_, and the apostles with Him. 















###### 15 







He said to them, "I have earnestly wanted to eat this Passover with you before I suffer; 















###### 16 







for I say to you, I will not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God." 















###### 17 







And when He had taken a cup and [^c]given thanks, He said, "Take this and share it among yourselves; 















###### 18 







for I say to you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine from now on until the kingdom of God comes." 















###### 19 







And when He had taken bread and given thanks, He broke it and gave it to them, saying, "This is My body which is given for you; do this in remembrance of Me." 















###### 20 







And in the same way _He took_ the cup after they had eaten, saying, "This cup, which is poured out for you, is the new covenant [ratified] in My blood. 















###### 21 







But listen, the hand of the one betraying Me is with Mine on the table. 















###### 22 







For indeed, the Son of Man is going as it has been determined; but woe (judgment is coming) to that man by whom He is betrayed _and_ handed over!" 















###### 23 







And they began to discuss among themselves which one of them it might be who was going to do this. ## Who Is Greatest? 















###### 24 







Now a dispute also arose among them as to which of them was regarded to be the greatest. 















###### 25 







Jesus said to them, "The kings of the Gentiles have absolute power _and_ lord it over them; and those in authority over them are called 'Benefactors.' 















###### 26 







But it is not to be this way with you; on the contrary, the one who is the greatest among you must become like the youngest [and least privileged], and the [one who is the] leader, like the servant. 















###### 27 







For who is the greater, the one who reclines _at the table_ or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines _at the table_? But I am among you as the one who serves. 















###### 28 







"You are those who have remained _and_ have stood by Me in My trials; 















###### 29 







and just as My Father has granted Me a kingdom, I grant you [the privilege] 















###### 30 







that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom, and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel. 















###### 31 







"Simon, Simon (Peter), listen! Satan has demanded _permission_ to sift [all of] you like grain; 















###### 32 







but I have prayed [especially] for you [Peter], that your faith [and confidence in Me] may not fail; and you, once you have turned back again [to Me], strengthen _and_ support your brothers [in the faith]." 















###### 33 







And Peter said to Him, "Lord, I am ready to go with You both to prison and to death!" 















###### 34 







Jesus said, "I say to you, Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will [utterly] deny three times that you know Me." 















###### 35 







And He said to them, "When I sent you out without a money belt and [provision] bag and [extra] sandals, did you lack anything?" They answered, "Nothing." 















###### 36 







Then He said to them, "But now, he who has a money belt is to take it along, and also his [provision] bag, and he who has no sword is to sell his coat and buy one. 















###### 37 







For I tell you that this [Scripture] which is written must be completed _and_ fulfilled in Me: 'And He was counted with the criminals'; for that which refers to Me has its fulfillment [and is settled]." 















###### 38 







They said, "Lord, look, here are two swords." And He said to them, "It is enough." ## The Garden of Gethsemane 















###### 39 







And He came out and went, as was His habit, to the Mount of Olives; and the disciples followed Him. 















###### 40 







When He arrived at the place [called Gethsemane], He said to them, "Pray _continually_ that you may not fall into temptation." 















###### 41 







And He withdrew from them about a stone's throw, and knelt down and prayed, 















###### 42 







saying, "Father, if You are willing, remove this cup [of divine wrath] from Me; yet not My will, but [always] Yours be done." 















###### 43 







[^d]Now an angel appeared to Him from heaven, strengthening Him. 















###### 44 







And being in agony [deeply distressed and anguished; almost to the point of death], He prayed more intently; and His [^e]sweat became like drops of blood, falling down on the ground. 















###### 45 







When He rose from prayer, He came to the disciples and found them sleeping from sorrow, 















###### 46 







and He said to them, "Why are you sleeping? Get up and pray that you may not fall into temptation." ## Judas Betrays Jesus 















###### 47 







While He was still speaking, a crowd _came_, and the man called Judas, one of the twelve [disciples], was leading the way for them. He approached Jesus to [^f]kiss Him. 















###### 48 







And Jesus said to him, "Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?" 















###### 49 







When those who were around Him saw what was about to happen, they said, "Lord, should we strike with the sword?" 















###### 50 







And [^g]one of them struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his right ear. 















###### 51 







But Jesus replied, "Stop! No more of this." And He touched the ear and healed him. 















###### 52 







Then Jesus said to the chief priests and officers of the temple and elders [of the Sanhedrin] who had come out against Him, "Have you come out with swords and clubs as you would against a robber? 















###### 53 







Day after day when I was with you in the temple, you did not lay hands on Me; but this hour and the power _and_ authority of darkness are yours." ## Peter's Denials 















###### 54 







Then they seized Him, and led Him _away_ and brought Him to the [elegant] house of the [Jewish] [^h]high priest. And Peter was following at a [safe] distance. 















###### 55 







After they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter sat among them. 















###### 56 







And a servant-girl, seeing him as he sat in the firelight and looking intently at him, said, "This man was with Him too." 















###### 57 







But Peter denied it, saying, "Woman, I do not know Him!" 















###### 58 







A little later someone else saw him and said, "You are one of them too." But Peter said, "Man, I am not!" 















###### 59 







After about an hour had passed, another man _began_ to insist, "This man was with Him, for he is a Galilean too." 















###### 60 







But Peter said, "Man, I do not know what you are talking about." Immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed. 















###### 61 







The Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had told him, "Before a rooster crows today, you will deny Me three times." 















###### 62 







And he went out and wept bitterly [deeply grieved and distressed]. 















###### 63 







Now the men who were holding Jesus in custody were mocking _and_ ridiculing Him [and treating Him with contempt] and beating Him. 















###### 64 







They blindfolded Him and asked, "Prophesy, who is it that struck You?" 















###### 65 







And they were saying many other [evil and slanderous] things against Him, blaspheming [speaking sacrilegiously and abusively about] Him. ## Jesus before the Sanhedrin 















###### 66 







When day came, the Council of the elders of the people (Sanhedrin, Jewish High Court) assembled, both chief priests and scribes; and they led Jesus away to the council _chamber_, saying, 















###### 67 







"If You are the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed), tell us." But He said to them, "If I tell you, you will not believe [what I say], 















###### 68 







and if I ask a question, you will not answer. 















###### 69 







But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God." 















###### 70 







And they all said, "Are You the Son of God, then?" He replied, "[^i]_It is just as_ you say." 















###### 71 







Then they asked, "What further need of testimony do we have? For we ourselves have heard it from His own mouth." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

The Passover lambs were selected on the tenth of Nisan (March/April) and sacrificed on the fourteenth of Nisan (the first day of the feast). The Passover meal was eaten that same night (15 Nisan). This was immediately followed by the Feast of Unleavened Bread (15-21 Nisan). The terms “Passover” and “The Feast of Unleavened Bread” were used interchangeably. [^b]: Luke 22:10 It would have been unusual to see a manservant carrying a jar of water, because that was considered a woman’s task. [^c]: Luke 22:17 Giving thanks consisted of two benedictions, one over the wine (Blessed are You, Lord our God, who has created the fruit of the vine!) and one for the return of the Feast Day with all it implied, as well as being allowed once more to witness it. [^d]: Luke 22:43 This particular encounter between Jesus and the ministering angel is found only in Luke’s gospel. Most early mss do not contain vv 43, 44. [^e]: Luke 22:44 A potentially life-threatening physical response to extreme physical or mental stress, _hematidrosis_. [^f]: Luke 22:47 A kiss on either the hand or cheek was usually an act of homage and a common gesture of greeting and reverence given to a rabbi by his disciples, but done here to identify Jesus. [^g]: Luke 22:50 John names Peter as the assailant and Malchus as the victim. [^h]: Luke 22:54 See note 3:2. [^i]: Luke 22:70 Lit _You say that I am_.

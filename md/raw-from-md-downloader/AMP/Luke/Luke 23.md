# Luke 23

***
















###### 1 







Then the whole assembly got up and brought Him before Pilate. 















###### 2 







They began to accuse Jesus, asserting, "We found this Man misleading _and_ perverting our nation and forbidding us to pay taxes to Caesar, and claiming that He Himself is Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed), a King." 















###### 3 







So Pilate asked Him, "Are You the King of the Jews?" And He answered him, "_It is just as_ you say." 















###### 4 







Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, "I find no guilt in this Man." 















###### 5 







But they were insistent and said, "He stirs up the people [to rebel], teaching throughout Judea, starting from Galilee even as far as here [in Jerusalem]." 















###### 6 







When Pilate heard it, he asked whether the man was a Galilean. 















###### 7 







And when he learned that He belonged to the jurisdiction of [^a]Herod [Antipas, the tetrarch of Galilee], he sent Him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time. ## Jesus before Herod 















###### 8 







When Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly pleased. He had wanted to see Him for a long time because of what he had heard about Him, and was hoping to see some [miraculous] sign [even something spectacular] done by Him. 















###### 9 







And he questioned Him at some length, but Jesus made no reply. 















###### 10 







The chief priests and the scribes were standing there, _continually_ accusing Him heatedly. 















###### 11 







And Herod with his soldiers, after treating Him with contempt and mocking _and_ ridiculing Him, dressed Him in a gorgeous robe and sent Him back to Pilate. 















###### 12 







Now that very day Herod and Pilate became friends with each other--before this they had been enemies. ## Pilate Seeks Jesus' Release 















###### 13 







Pilate summoned the chief priests and the rulers and the people, 















###### 14 







and said to them, "You brought this man before me as one who corrupts _and_ incites the people to rebellion. After examining Him before you, I have found no guilt in this Man regarding the charges which you make against Him. 















###### 15 







No, nor has Herod, for he sent Him back to us; and indeed, He has done nothing to deserve death. 















###### 16 







Therefore I will punish Him [to teach Him a lesson] and release Him." 















###### 17 







[^b][Now he was obligated to release to them one prisoner at the Feast.] 















###### 18 







But they [loudly] shouted out all together, saying, "Away with this Man, and release Barabbas to us!" 















###### 19 







**(**He was one who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection that happened in the city, and for murder.**)** 















###### 20 







Pilate addressed them again, wanting to release Jesus, 















###### 21 







but they kept shouting out, "Crucify, crucify Him!" 















###### 22 







A third time he said to them, "Why, what wrong has He done? I have found no guilt [no crime, no offense] in Him _demanding_ death; therefore I will punish Him [to teach Him a lesson] and release Him." 















###### 23 







But they were insistent _and_ unrelenting, demanding with loud voices that Jesus be crucified. And their voices _began_ to prevail _and_ accomplish their purpose. 















###### 24 







Pilate pronounced sentence that their demand be granted. 















###### 25 







And he released the man they were asking for who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, but he handed over Jesus to their will. ## Simon Bears the Cross 















###### 26 







When they led Him away, they seized a man, [^c]Simon of [^d]Cyrene, who was coming in [to the city] from the country, and [^e]placed on him the cross to carry behind Jesus. 















###### 27 







Following Him was a large crowd of the people, including women who were mourning and wailing for Him. 















###### 28 







But Jesus, turning toward them, said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for Me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. 















###### 29 







For behold, the days are coming when they will say, 'Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that have not given birth, and the breasts that have never nursed.' 















###### 30 







Then they will begin to say to the mountains, 'Fall on us!' and to the hills, 'Cover us!' 















###### 31 







[^f]For if they do these things when the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?" 















###### 32 







Two others also, who were criminals, were being led away to be executed with Him. ## The Crucifixion 















###### 33 







When they came to the place called [^g]The Skull, there they crucified Him and the criminals, one on the right and one on the left. 















###### 34 







[^h]And Jesus was saying, "Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing." And they cast lots, dividing His clothes among themselves. 















###### 35 







Now the people stood by, watching; but even the rulers ridiculed _and_ sneered at Him, saying, "He saved others [from death]; let Him save Himself if He is the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed) of God, His Chosen One." 















###### 36 







The soldiers also mocked Him, coming up to Him and [cruelly] offering Him sour wine, 















###### 37 







and sarcastically saying, "If you are [really] the King of the Jews, save Yourself [from death]!" 















###### 38 







Now there was also an inscription above Him: "THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS." 















###### 39 







One of the criminals who had been hanged [on a cross beside Him] kept hurling abuse at Him, saying, "Are You not the Christ? Save Yourself and us [from death]!" 















###### 40 







But the other one rebuked him, saying, "Do you not even fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? 















###### 41 







We _are suffering_ justly, because we are getting what we deserve for what we have done; but this Man has done nothing wrong." 















###### 42 







And he was saying, "Jesus, [please] remember me when You come into Your kingdom!" 















###### 43 







Jesus said to him, "I assure you _and_ most solemnly say to you, today you will be with Me in [^i]Paradise." 















###### 44 







It was now about the sixth hour (noon), and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour (3:00 p.m.), 















###### 45 







because the sun was [^j]obscured; and the veil [of the Holy of Holies] of the temple was [^k]torn in two [from top to bottom]. 















###### 46 







And Jesus, crying out with a loud voice, said, "Father, into Your hands I commit My spirit!" Having said this, He breathed His last. 















###### 47 







Now when the centurion saw what had taken place, he _began_ praising _and_ honoring God, saying, "Certainly this Man was innocent." 















###### 48 







All the crowds who had gathered for this spectacle, when they saw what had happened, _began_ to return [to their homes], beating their breasts [as a sign of mourning or repentance]. 















###### 49 







And all His acquaintances and the women who had accompanied Him from Galilee were standing at a distance, watching these things. ## Jesus Is Buried 















###### 50 







A man named Joseph, who was a member of the Council (Sanhedrin, Jewish High Court), a good and honorable man 















###### 51 







**(**he had not consented to the Council's plan and action**)** _a man_ from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who was waiting for _and_ expecting the kingdom of God; 















###### 52 







this man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. 















###### 53 







And [after receiving permission] he took it down and wrapped it in a linen [burial] cloth and laid Him in a tomb cut into the rock, where no one had yet been laid. 















###### 54 







It was the day of preparation [for the Sabbath], and the Sabbath was dawning. 















###### 55 







Now the women who had come with Him from Galilee followed [closely], and saw the tomb and how His body was laid. 















###### 56 







Then they went back and prepared spices and ointments _and_ sweet-smelling herbs. And on the Sabbath they rested in accordance with the commandment [forbidding work]. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

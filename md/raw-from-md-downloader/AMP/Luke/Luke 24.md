# Luke 24

***
















###### 1 







But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, the women went to the tomb bringing the spices which they had prepared [to finish anointing the body]. 















###### 2 







And they found the [large, circular] stone rolled back from the tomb, 















###### 3 







but when they went inside, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. 















###### 4 







While they were perplexed _and_ wondering about this, suddenly, two men in dazzling clothing stood near them; 















###### 5 







and as the women were terrified and were bowing their faces to the ground, the men said to them, "Why are you looking for the living One among the dead? 















###### 6 







He is not here, but has risen. Remember how He told you, while He was still in Galilee, 















###### 7 







saying that the Son of Man must be handed over to sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise [from death to life]." 















###### 8 







And they remembered His words, 















###### 9 







and after returning from the tomb, they reported all these things to the eleven [apostles] and to all the rest. 















###### 10 







Now they were Mary Magdalene and Joanna [the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward] and Mary the _mother_ of James; also the other women with them were telling these things to the apostles. 















###### 11 







But their report seemed to them like idle talk _and_ nonsense, and they would not believe them. 















###### 12 







But Peter got up and ran to the tomb. Stooping [at the small entrance] and looking in, he saw only the linen [^a]wrappings; and he went away, wondering about what had happened. ## The Road to Emmaus 















###### 13 







And then, that very day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, which was about [^b]seven miles from Jerusalem. 















###### 14 







And they were talking with each other about all these things which had taken place. 















###### 15 







While they were talking and discussing it, Jesus Himself came up and _began_ walking with them. 















###### 16 







But their eyes were [miraculously] prevented from recognizing Him. 















###### 17 







Then Jesus asked them, "What are you discussing with one another as you walk along?" And they stood still, looking brokenhearted. 















###### 18 







One _of them_, named Cleopas, answered Him, "Are you the only stranger visiting Jerusalem who is unaware of the things which have happened here in these [recent] days?" 















###### 19 







He asked, "What things?" And they replied, "The things about Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet powerful in deed and word in the sight of God and all the people, 















###### 20 







and how the chief priests and our rulers handed Him over to be sentenced to death, and crucified Him. 















###### 21 







But we were hoping that it was He who was going to redeem Israel _and_ set our nation free. Indeed, besides all this, it is the third day since these things happened. 















###### 22 







And also some of the women among us shocked us. They were at the tomb early in the morning, 















###### 23 







and they did not find His body. Then they came back, saying that they had even seen a vision of angels who said that He was alive! 















###### 24 







Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just exactly as the women had said, but they did not see Him." 















###### 25 







Then Jesus said to them, "O foolish men, and slow of heart to trust _and_ believe in everything that the prophets have spoken! 















###### 26 







Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and [only then to] enter His glory?" 















###### 27 







Then beginning with Moses and [throughout] all the [writings of the] prophets, He explained _and_ interpreted for them the things referring to Himself [found] in all the Scriptures. 















###### 28 







Then they approached the village where they were going, and He acted as if He were going farther. 















###### 29 







But they urged Him [not to go on], saying, "Stay with us, because it is almost evening, and the day has just about ended." So He went inside to stay with them. 















###### 30 







And it happened that as He reclined _at the table_ with them, He took the bread and blessed it, and breaking it, He _began_ giving it to them. 















###### 31 







Then their eyes were [suddenly] opened [by God] and they [clearly] recognized Him; and He vanished from their sight. 















###### 32 







They said to one another, "Were not our hearts burning within us while He was talking with us on the road and opening the Scriptures to us?" 















###### 33 







They got up that very hour and went back to Jerusalem, and found the eleven [apostles] gathered together and those who were with them, 















###### 34 







saying, "The Lord has really risen and has appeared to Simon [Peter]!" 















###### 35 







They _began_ describing in detail what had happened on the road, and how Jesus was recognized by them when He broke the bread. ## Other Appearances 















###### 36 







While they were talking about this, Jesus Himself [suddenly] stood among them and said to them, "Peace be to you." 















###### 37 







But they were startled and terrified and thought that they were seeing a spirit. 















###### 38 







And He said, "Why are you troubled, and why are doubts rising in your hearts? 















###### 39 







Look at [the marks in] My hands and My feet, [and see] that it is I Myself. Touch Me and see; a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as you see that I have." 















###### 40 







After saying this, He showed them His hands and His feet. 















###### 41 







While they still did not believe it because of their joy and amazement, He asked them, "Do you have anything here to eat?" 















###### 42 







They gave Him a piece of broiled fish, 















###### 43 







and He took it and ate it in front of them. 















###### 44 







Then He said to them, "This is what I told you while I was still with you, everything which has been written about Me in the [^c]Law of Moses and the [writings of the] Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled." 















###### 45 







Then He opened their minds to [help them] understand the Scriptures, 















###### 46 







and said, "And so it is written, that the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed) would suffer and rise from the dead on the third day, 















###### 47 







and that repentance [necessary] for forgiveness of sins would be preached in His name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem. 















###### 48 







You are witnesses of these things. 















###### 49 







Listen carefully: I am sending the Promise of My Father [the Holy Spirit] upon you; but you are to remain in the city [of Jerusalem] until you are clothed (fully equipped) with power from on high." ## The Ascension 















###### 50 







Then He led them out as far as Bethany, and lifted up His hands and blessed them. 















###### 51 







While He was blessing them, He left them and was taken up into heaven. 















###### 52 







And they worshiped Him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy [fully understanding that He lives and that He is the Son of God]; 















###### 53 







and they were continually in the temple blessing _and_ praising God. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

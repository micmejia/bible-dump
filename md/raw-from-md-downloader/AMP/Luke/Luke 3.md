# Luke 3

***
















###### 1 







Now in the fifteenth year of [Emperor] [^a]Tiberius Caesar's reign--when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod [Antipas] was tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip was tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias was tetrarch of Abilene-- 















###### 2 







in the high [^b]priesthood of Annas and [^c]Caiaphas [his son-in-law], the word of God came to John, the son of Zacharias, in the wilderness. 















###### 3 







And he went into all the country around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sin; 















###### 4 







as it is written _and_ forever remains written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, "The voice of one shouting in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way of the Lord, [^d]Make His paths straight. 















###### 5 







'Every ravine shall be filled up, And every mountain and hill shall be leveled; And the crooked [places] shall be made straight, And the rough roads smooth; 















###### 6 







and [^e]all mankind shall see the salvation of God.'" 















###### 7 







So he _began_ saying to the crowds who were coming out to be baptized by him, "You brood of [^f]vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath [of God that is] to come? 















###### 8 







Therefore produce fruit that is worthy of [and consistent with your] repentance [that is, live changed lives, turn from sin and seek God and His righteousness]. And do not _even_ begin to say to yourselves [as a defense], 'We have Abraham for our father [and so our heritage assures us of salvation]'; for I say to you that from these stones God is able to raise up children (descendants) for Abraham [for God can replace the unrepentant, regardless of their heritage, with those who are obedient]. 















###### 9 







Even now the axe [of God's judgment] is swinging toward the root of the trees; so every tree that does not produce good fruit is being cut down and thrown into the fire." 















###### 10 







The crowds asked him, "Then what are we to do?" 















###### 11 







And John replied, "The man who has two tunics is to share with him who has none; and he who has food is to do the same." 















###### 12 







Even _some_ tax collectors came to be baptized, and they asked, "Teacher, what are we to do?" 















###### 13 







And he told them, "Collect no more than the _fixed amount_ you have been ordered to [collect]." 















###### 14 







_Some_ soldiers asked him, "And _what about_ us, what are we to do?" And he replied to them, "Do not [^g]extort money from anyone or harass _or_ blackmail _anyone_, and be satisfied with your wages." 















###### 15 







Now the people were in a state of expectation, and all were wondering in their hearts about John, as to whether he was the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed). 















###### 16 







John answered them all by saying, "As for me, I baptize you [only] [^h]with water; but One who is mightier [more powerful, more noble] than I is coming, and I am not fit to untie the strap of His sandals [even as His slave]. He will baptize you [who truly repent] with the Holy Spirit and [you who remain unrepentant] with [^i]fire. 















###### 17 







His [^j]winnowing fork is in His hand to thoroughly clear His threshing floor, and to gather the wheat (believers) into His barn (kingdom); but He will burn up the chaff (the unrepentant) with unquenchable fire." 















###### 18 







So with many other appeals _and_ various admonitions John preached the good news (gospel) to the people. 















###### 19 







But when Herod [Antipas] the tetrarch was _repeatedly_ reprimanded [and convicted by John's disapproval] for having [^k]Herodias, his brother's wife [as his own], and for all the wicked things that Herod had done, 















###### 20 







he also added this to them all: he locked up John in prison. ## Jesus' Baptism 















###### 21 







Now when all the people were baptized, Jesus was also baptized, and while He was praying, the [visible] heaven was opened, 















###### 22 







and the [^l]Holy Spirit descended on Him in bodily form like a dove, and a voice came from heaven, "You are My Son, My Beloved, in You I am well-pleased _and_ delighted!" ## Genealogy of Jesus 















###### 23

[^b]: Luke 3:2 Annas served from a.d. 6-15, before being deposed by Roman authorities; however, the Jews continued to recognize him as high priest _de facto_ even though others, including his sons and son-in-law, held the official title and publicly appeared to serve as high priest. [^c]: Luke 3:2 Served as high priest from a.d. 18-36, although Annas kept _de facto_ authority. [^d]: Luke 3:4 In spiritual terms, John’s message was clearing the way for the arrival of the Messiah by preparing the hearts of those who were to follow Him. [^e]: Luke 3:6 I.e. salvation is available to both Jew and Gentile. [^f]: Luke 3:7 I.e. poisonous snakes. An expression intended to describe the repulsive character of many people in the crowd. [^g]: Luke 3:14 The Greek term is similar to our colloquial “shake down,” that is, using violence or threats to force someone to hand over money. [^h]: Luke 3:16 The Greek here can be translated _in, with_, or _by_. [^i]: Luke 3:16 Some scholars view “fire” as judgment; however, another view of “fire” purports that the text refers to the fiery baptism of the Holy Spirit, not judgment. The Holy Spirit promised here has been associated with Pentecost, purification, testing, and judgment. Each person who accepts Jesus is filled with the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:5-8). According to this view the fire indicates that the believer is purified as in the refining of gold. Fire burns up the impurities and the gold (the believer) survives (cf 1 Cor 3:12, 13; James 1:3). [^j]: Luke 3:17 A tool roughly resembling a pitchfork, used to separate grains of wheat from the chaff by throwing the wheat into the air, and allowing the wind to blow away the lighter chaff. [^k]: Luke 3:19 See note Matt 14:3. [^l]: Luke 3:22 See note Matt 3:17.

# Luke 4

***
















###### 1 







Now Jesus, full of [and in perfect communication with] the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness 















###### 2 







for forty days, being tempted by the devil. And He ate nothing during those days, and when they ended, He was hungry. 















###### 3 







Then the devil said to Him, "If You are the Son of God, command this stone to turn into bread." 















###### 4 







Jesus replied to him, "It is written _and_ forever remains written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone[^a].'" 















###### 5 







Then he led Jesus up [to a high mountain] and displayed before Him all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth [and their magnificence] in the twinkling of an eye. 















###### 6 







And the devil said to Him, "I will give You all this realm and its glory [its power, its renown]; because it has been handed over to me, and I give it to whomever I wish. 















###### 7 







Therefore if You worship before me, it will all be Yours." 















###### 8 







Jesus replied to him, "It is written _and_ forever remains written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and serve only Him.'" 















###### 9 







Then he led Jesus to Jerusalem and had Him stand on the pinnacle (highest point) of the temple, and said [mockingly] to Him, "If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down from here; 















###### 10 







for it is written _and_ forever remains written, 'He will command His angels concerning You to guard _and_ protect You,' 















###### 11 







and, 'they will lift You up on _their_ hands, So that You do not strike Your foot against a stone.'" 















###### 12 







Jesus replied to him, "It is said [in Scripture], 'you shall not tempt the Lord your God [to prove Himself to you].'" 















###### 13 







When the devil had finished every temptation, he [temporarily] left Him until a more opportune time. ## Jesus' Public Ministry 















###### 14 







Then Jesus went back to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and the news about Him spread through the entire region. 















###### 15 







And He _began_ teaching in their synagogues and was praised _and_ glorified _and_ honored by all. 















###### 16 







So He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up; and as was His custom, He entered the synagogue on the Sabbath, and stood up to read. 















###### 17 







The scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to Him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written, 















###### 18 







"The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me (the Messiah), Because He has anointed Me to preach the good news to the poor. He has sent Me to announce release (pardon, forgiveness) to the captives, And recovery of sight to the blind, To set free those who are oppressed (downtrodden, bruised, crushed by tragedy), 















###### 19 







to proclaim the favorable year of the Lord [the day when salvation and the favor of God abound greatly]." 















###### 20 







Then He rolled up the scroll [having stopped in the middle of the verse], gave it back to the attendant and sat down [to teach]; and the eyes of all those in the synagogue were [attentively] fixed on Him. 















###### 21 







He began speaking to them: "Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing _and_ in your presence." 















###### 22 







And [as He continued on] they all were speaking well of Him, and were in awe _and_ were wondering about the words of grace which were coming from His lips; and they were saying, "Is this not Joseph's son?" 















###### 23 







So He said to them, "You will no doubt quote this proverb to Me, 'Physician, heal Yourself! Whatever [miracles] that we heard were done [by You] in Capernaum, do here in Your hometown as well.'" 















###### 24 







Then He said, "I assure you _and_ most solemnly say to you, no prophet is welcome in his hometown. 















###### 25 







But in truth I say to you, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the sky was closed up for three years and six months, when a great famine came over all the land; 















###### 26 







and yet Elijah was not sent [by the Lord] to a single one of them, but only to Zarephath _in the land_ of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow. 















###### 27 







And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet; and not one of them was cleansed [by being healed] except Naaman the Syrian." 















###### 28 







As they heard these things [about God's grace to these two Gentiles], _the people_ in the synagogue were filled with a great rage; 















###### 29 







and they got up and drove Him out of the city, and led Him to the crest of the hill on which their city had been built, in order to hurl Him down the cliff. 















###### 30 







But passing [miraculously] through the crowd, He went on His way. 















###### 31 







Then He came down [from the hills of Nazareth] to Capernaum, a city of Galilee [on the shore of the sea], and He was teaching them on the Sabbath; 















###### 32 







and they were surprised [almost overwhelmed] at His teaching, because His message was [given] with authority _and_ power _and_ great ability. 















###### 33 







There was a man in the synagogue who was possessed by the spirit of an unclean demon; and he cried out with a loud _and_ terrible voice, 















###### 34 







"Let us alone! [^b]What business do we have [in common] with each other, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are--the Holy One of God!" 















###### 35 







But Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be silent (muzzled, gagged) and come out of him!" And when the demon had thrown the man down among them, he came out of him without injuring him in any way. 















###### 36 







They were all astonished _and_ in awe, and _began_ saying to one another, "What is this message? For with authority and power He commands the unclean spirits and they come out!" 















###### 37 







And the news about Him spread into every place in the surrounding district (Galilee). ## Many Are Healed 















###### 38 







Then Jesus got up and left the synagogue and went to Simon's (Peter's) house. Now Simon's mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they asked Him to help her. 















###### 39 







Standing over her, He rebuked the fever, and it left her; and immediately she got up and _began_ serving them [as her guests]. 















###### 40 







While the sun was setting [marking the end of the Sabbath day], all those who had any _who were_ sick with various diseases brought them to Jesus; and laying His hands on each one of them, He was healing them [exhibiting His authority as Messiah]. 















###### 41 







Demons also were coming out of many people, shouting, "You are the Son of God!" But He rebuked them and would not allow them to speak, because they knew that He was the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed). 















###### 42 







When daybreak came, Jesus left [Simon Peter's house] and went to a secluded place; and the crowds were searching for Him, and [they] came to Him and tried to keep Him from leaving them. 















###### 43 







But He said, "I must preach [the good news of] the kingdom of God to the other cities also, because I was sent for this purpose." 















###### 44 







So He continued preaching in the synagogues of Judea [the country of the Jews, including Galilee]. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Luke 9

***
















###### 1 







Now Jesus called together the twelve [disciples] and gave them [the right to exercise] power and authority over all the demons and to heal diseases. 















###### 2 







Then He sent them out [on a brief journey] to preach [^a]the kingdom of God and to perform healing. 















###### 3 







And He said to them, "Take nothing for _your_ journey [that might encumber you]--neither a walking stick, nor bag, nor bread, nor money; and do not _even_ have two [^b]tunics apiece. 















###### 4 







Whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave that city [to go to another]. 















###### 5 







And as for all those who do not welcome you, when you leave that city, shake the dust off your feet [breaking all ties with them] as a testimony against them [that they rejected My message]." 















###### 6 







So they _began_ going from village to village, preaching the gospel and healing _the sick_ everywhere. 















###### 7 







Now Herod [Antipas] the tetrarch [who governed a portion of Palestine including Galilee and Perea] heard about all that was being done [by Jesus], and he was thoroughly perplexed, because it was said by some that John [the Baptist whom he had ordered beheaded] had been raised from the dead, 















###### 8 







and by others that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the [other] prophets of old had been resurrected. 















###### 9 







Herod said, "I personally had John beheaded. Who is this man about whom I hear such things?" And he kept trying to see Jesus. 















###### 10 







When the apostles returned, they told Him all that they had done. He took them with Him and He privately withdrew [across the Jordan] to a city called Bethsaida. 















###### 11 







But when the crowds learned of it, they followed Him; and He welcomed them and He _began_ talking to them about the kingdom of God, and healing those who needed to be healed. ## Five Thousand Fed 















###### 12 







Now the day was ending, and the twelve [disciples] came and said to Him, "Send the crowd away, so that they may go into the surrounding villages and countryside and find lodging, and get provisions; because here we are in an isolated place." 















###### 13 







But He said to them, "You give them _something_ to eat." They said, "We have no more than five loaves and two fish--unless perhaps we go and buy food for all these people." 















###### 14 







**(**For there were [^c]about 5,000 men.**)** And He said to His disciples, "Have them sit down _to eat_ in groups of about fifty each." 















###### 15 







They did so, and had them all sit down. 















###### 16 







Then He took the five loaves and the two fish, and He looked up to heaven [and gave thanks] and blessed them, and broke _them_ and kept giving _them_ to the disciples to set before the crowd. 















###### 17 







They all ate and were [completely] satisfied; and the broken pieces which they had left over were [abundant and were] picked up--twelve baskets full. 















###### 18 







Now it happened that as Jesus was praying privately, the disciples were with Him, and He asked them, "Who do the crowds say that I am?" 















###### 19 







They answered, "John the Baptist, and some say, Elijah; but others, that one of the ancient prophets has come back to life." 















###### 20 







And He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?" Peter replied, "The Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed) of God!" 















###### 21 







But He strictly warned and admonished them not to tell this to anyone, 















###### 22 







saying, "The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected [as the Messiah] by the elders and chief priests and scribes (Sanhedrin, Jewish High Court), and be put to death, and on the third day be raised up [from death to life]." 















###### 23 







And He was saying to them all, "If anyone wishes to follow Me [as My disciple], he must deny himself [set aside selfish interests], and take up his cross daily [expressing a willingness to endure whatever may come] and follow Me [believing in Me, conforming to My example in living and, if need be, suffering or perhaps dying because of faith in Me]. 















###### 24 







For whoever wishes to save his life [in this world] will [eventually] lose it [through death], but whoever loses his life [in this world] for My sake, he is the one who will save it [from the consequences of sin and separation from God]. 















###### 25 







For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world [wealth, fame, success], and loses or forfeits himself? 















###### 26 







For whoever is ashamed [here and now] of Me and My words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when He comes in His glory and _the glory_ of the [heavenly] Father and of the holy angels. 















###### 27 







But I tell you truthfully, there are [^d]some among those standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God." ## The Transfiguration 















###### 28 







Now about eight days after these teachings, He took along Peter and John and James and went up on the mountain to pray. 















###### 29 







As He was praying, the appearance of His face became different [actually transformed], and His clothing _became_ white _and_ flashing with the brilliance of lightning. 















###### 30 







And behold, two men were talking with Him; and they were Moses and Elijah, 















###### 31 







who appeared in glory, and were speaking of His departure [from earthly life], which He was about to bring to fulfillment at Jerusalem. 















###### 32 







Now Peter and those who were with him had been overcome with sleep; but when they were fully awake, they saw His glory _and_ splendor _and_ majesty, and the two men who were standing with Him. 















###### 33 







And as these [men, Moses and Elijah] were leaving Him, Peter said to Jesus, "Master, it is delightful _and_ good for us to be here; we should make three [sacred] tents; one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah"--not realizing what he was saying. 















###### 34 







But even as he was saying this, a cloud formed and _began_ to overshadow them; and they were [greatly] afraid as they entered the cloud. 















###### 35 







Then [^e]a voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is My beloved Son, My Chosen One; listen _and_ obey _and_ yield to Him!" 















###### 36 







When the voice had ceased, Jesus was found _there_ alone. And they kept silent, and told no one at that time any of the things which they had seen [concerning the divine manifestation]. 















###### 37 







On the next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met Him. 















###### 38 







And a man from the crowd shouted for help, "Teacher, I beg You to look at my son, because he is my only child; 















###### 39 







and a spirit seizes him, and suddenly he cries out, and it throws him into a convulsion so that he foams _at the mouth_; and only with [great] difficulty does it leave him, mauling _and_ bruising him _as it leaves_. 















###### 40 







I begged Your disciples to cast it out, but they could not." 















###### 41 







Jesus answered, "You unbelieving and perverted generation! How long shall I be with you and put up with you? Bring your son here [to Me]." 















###### 42 







Even while the boy was coming, the demon slammed him down and threw him into a [violent] convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy and gave him back to his father. 















###### 43 







They were all amazed [practically overwhelmed] at the [evidence of the] greatness of God _and_ His majesty _and_ His wondrous work. But while they were still awed by everything Jesus was doing, He said to His disciples, 















###### 44 







"Let these words sink into your ears: the Son of Man is going to be betrayed _and_ handed over to men [who are His enemies]." 















###### 45 







However, they did not understand this statement. Its meaning was kept hidden from them so that they would not grasp it; and they were afraid to ask Him about it. ## The Test of Greatness 















###### 46 







An argument started among them as to which of them might be the greatest [surpassing the others in esteem and authority]. 















###### 47 







But Jesus, knowing what they were thinking in their heart, took a child and had him stand beside Him, 















###### 48 







and He told them, "Whoever welcomes this child in My name welcomes Me; and whoever welcomes Me [also] welcomes Him who sent Me; for the one who is least among all of you [that is, the one who is genuinely humble--the one with a realistic self-view]--he is the one who is [truly] great." 















###### 49 







John replied, "Master, we saw someone driving out demons in Your name; and we tried to stop him because he does not follow along with us." 















###### 50 







But Jesus told him, "Do not stop _him_; for he who is not against you is for you." 















###### 51 







Now when the time was approaching for Him to be taken up [to heaven], He was determined to go to Jerusalem [to fulfill His purpose]. 















###### 52 







He sent messengers on ahead of Him, and they went into a Samaritan village to make arrangements for Him; 















###### 53 







but the people would not welcome Him, [^f]because He was traveling toward Jerusalem. 















###### 54 







When His disciples James and John saw this, they said, "Lord, do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and destroy them?" 















###### 55 







But He turned and rebuked them [^g][and He said, "You do not know what kind of spirit you are; 















###### 56 







for the Son of Man did not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them."] And they journeyed on to another village. ## Exacting Discipleship 















###### 57 







As they were going along the road, someone said to Him, "I will follow You wherever You go." 















###### 58 







And Jesus told him, "Foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay His head." 















###### 59 







He said to another, "Follow Me [accepting Me as Master and Teacher]." But he said, "Lord, allow me first to go and [^h]bury my father." 















###### 60 







But He said to him, "Allow the [spiritually] dead to bury their own dead; but as for you, go and spread the news about the kingdom of God." 















###### 61 







Another also said, "I will follow You, Lord [as Your disciple]; but first let me say goodbye to those at my home." 















###### 62 







But Jesus said to him, "No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back [to the things left behind] is fit for the kingdom of God." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

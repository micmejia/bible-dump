# Malachi 2

***
















###### 1 







"Now, O priests, this commandment is for you. 















###### 2 







If you do not listen, and if you do not take it to heart to honor My name," says the LORD of hosts, "then I will send the curse upon you and I will curse your blessings [on the people]. Indeed, I have cursed them already, because you are not taking it to heart. 















###### 3 







Behold, I am going to rebuke your seed, and I will spread the refuse on your faces, the refuse from the festival offerings; and you will be taken away with it [in disgrace]. 















###### 4 







Then you will know [without any doubt] that I have sent this [new] commandment to you (priests), that My covenant may continue with Levi [the priestly tribe]," says the LORD of hosts. 















###### 5 







"My covenant with Levi was [one of] life and peace, and I gave them to him as an object of reverence; so he [and the priests] feared Me and stood in reverent awe of My name. 















###### 6 







True instruction was in Levi's mouth and injustice was not found on his lips. He walked with Me in peace and uprightness, and he turned many from wickedness. 















###### 7 







For the lips of the priest should guard _and_ preserve knowledge [of My law], and the people should seek instruction from his mouth; for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts. 















###### 8 







But as for you [priests], you have turned from the way and you have caused many to stumble by your instruction [in the law]. You have violated the covenant of Levi," says the LORD of hosts. 















###### 9 







"So I have also made you despised and abased before all the people, just as you are not keeping My ways but are showing partiality [to people] in [your administration of] the law." ## Sin in the Family 















###### 10 







Do we not all have one Father? Has not one God created us? Why do we deal treacherously with one another, profaning the covenant of our fathers [with God]? 















###### 11 







Judah has been treacherous (disloyal), and an repulsive act has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the sanctuary of the LORD which He loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign god. 















###### 12 







As for the man who does this, may the LORD cut off from the tents of Jacob to the last man those who do this [evil thing], awake and aware, even the one who brings an offering to the LORD of hosts. 















###### 13 







This is another thing you do: you cover the altar of the LORD with tears, with [your own] weeping and sighing, because the LORD no longer regards your offering or accepts it with favor from your hand. 















###### 14 







But you say, "Why [does He reject it]?" Because the LORD has been a witness between you and the wife of your youth, against whom you have dealt treacherously. Yet she is your marriage companion and the wife of your covenant [made by your vows]. 















###### 15 







But not one has done so who has a remnant of the Spirit. And what did that one do while seeking a godly offspring? Take heed then to your spirit, and let no one deal treacherously against the wife of your youth. 















###### 16 







"For I hate [^a]divorce," says the LORD, the God of Israel, "and him who covers his garment with wrong _and_ violence," says the LORD of hosts. "Therefore keep watch on your spirit, so that you do not deal treacherously [with your wife]." 















###### 17 







You have wearied the LORD with your words. But you say, "In what way have we wearied Him?" In that you say, "Everyone who does evil is good in the sight of the LORD, and He delights in them," or [by asking], "Where is the God of justice?" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

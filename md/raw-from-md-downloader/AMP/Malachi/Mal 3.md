# Malachi 3

***
















###### 1 







"Behold, I am going to send My [^a]messenger, and he will prepare _and_ clear the way before Me. And the Lord [the Messiah], whom you seek, will suddenly come to His temple; the [^b]Messenger of the covenant, in whom you delight, behold, He is coming," says the LORD of hosts. 















###### 2 







But who can endure the day of His coming? And who can stand when He appears? For He is like a refiner's fire and like launderer's soap [which removes impurities and uncleanness]. 















###### 3 







He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and He will purify the sons of Levi [the priests], and refine them like gold and silver, so that they may present to the LORD [grain] offerings in righteousness. 















###### 4 







Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the LORD as in the days of old and as in ancient years. 















###### 5 







"Then I will come near you for judgment; I will be a swift witness against sorcerers, against adulterers, against perjurers, and against those who oppress the laborer in his wages and widows and the fatherless, and _against_ those who turn away the alien [from his right], and those who do not fear Me [with awe-filled reverence]," says the LORD of hosts. 















###### 6 







"For I am the LORD, I do not change [but remain faithful to My covenant with you]; that is why you, O sons of Jacob, have not come to an end. 















###### 7 







"Yet from the days of your fathers you have turned away from My statutes _and_ ordinances and have not kept them. Return to Me, and I will return to you," says the LORD of hosts. "But you say, 'How shall we return?' ## You Have Robbed God 















###### 8 







"Will a man rob God? Yet you are robbing Me! But you say, 'In what way have we robbed You?' In tithes and offerings [you have withheld]. 















###### 9 







You are cursed with a curse, for you are robbing Me, this whole nation! 















###### 10 







Bring all the tithes (the tenth) into the [^c]storehouse, so that there may be [^d]food in My house, and test Me now in this," says the LORD of hosts, "if I will not open for you the windows of heaven and pour out for you [so great] a blessing until there is no more room to receive it. 















###### 11 







Then I will rebuke the [^e]devourer (insects, plague) for your sake and he will not destroy the fruits of the ground, nor will your vine in the field drop _its grapes_ [before harvest]," says the LORD of hosts. 















###### 12 







"All nations shall call you happy _and_ blessed, for you shall be a land of delight," says the LORD of hosts. 















###### 13 







"Your words have been harsh against Me," says the LORD. "But you say, 'What have we spoken against You?' 















###### 14 







You have said, 'It is useless to serve God. What profit is it if we keep His ordinances, and walk around like mourners before the LORD of hosts? 















###### 15 







So now we call the arrogant happy _and_ blessed. Evildoers are exalted _and_ prosper; and when they test God, they escape [unpunished].'" ## The Book of Remembrance 















###### 16 







Then those who feared the LORD [with awe-filled reverence] spoke to one another; and the LORD paid attention and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before Him of those who fear the LORD [with an attitude of reverence and respect] and who esteem His name. 















###### 17 







"They will be Mine," says the LORD of hosts, "on that day when I publicly recognize them _and_ openly declare them to be My own possession [that is, My very special treasure]. And I will have compassion on them _and_ spare them as a man spares his own son who serves him." 















###### 18 







Then you will again distinguish between the righteous and the wicked, between the one who serves God and the one who does not serve Him. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

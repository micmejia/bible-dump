# Mark 1

***
















###### 1 







The beginning of the [facts regarding the] good news of [^a]Jesus Christ, the Son of God. 















###### 2 







As it is written _and_ forever remains in the [writings of the] prophet Isaiah: "Behold, I send My messenger ahead of You, Who will prepare Your way-- 















###### 3 







A voice of one shouting in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way of the Lord, [^b]Make His paths straight!'" 















###### 4 







[^c]John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins [that is, requiring a change of one's old way of thinking, turning away from sin and seeking God and His righteousness]. 















###### 5 







And all the country of Judea and all the people of Jerusalem were _continually_ going out to him; and they were being baptized by him in the Jordan River, as they confessed their sins. 















###### 6 







John wore clothing made of camel's hair and had a [wide] leather [^d]band around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey. 















###### 7 







And he was preaching, saying, "After me comes He who is mightier [more powerful, more noble] than I, and I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the straps of His sandals [even as His slave]. 















###### 8 







As for me, I baptized you [who came to me] with water [only]; but He will baptize you [who truly repent] [^e]with the Holy Spirit." ## The Baptism of Jesus 















###### 9 







In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. 















###### 10 







[^f]Immediately coming up out of the water, he (John) saw the heavens torn open, and the [^g]Spirit like a dove descending on Him (Jesus); 















###### 11 







and a [^h]voice came out of heaven saying: "You are My beloved Son, in You I am well-pleased _and_ delighted!" 















###### 12 







Immediately the [Holy] Spirit forced Him out into the wilderness. 















###### 13 







He was in the wilderness forty days being tempted [to do evil] by Satan; and He was with the wild animals, and the angels ministered _continually_ to Him. ## Jesus Preaches in Galilee 















###### 14 







Now after John [the Baptist] was arrested _and_ [^i]taken into custody, Jesus went to Galilee, preaching the good news of [the kingdom of] God, 















###### 15 







and saying, "The [appointed period of] time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent [change your inner self--your old way of thinking, regret past sins, live your life in a way that proves repentance; seek God's purpose for your life] and believe [with a deep, abiding trust] in the good news [regarding salvation]." 















###### 16 







As Jesus was walking by the shore of the [^j]Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon [Peter] and Simon's brother, [^k]Andrew, casting a net in the sea; for they were fishermen. 















###### 17 







And Jesus said to them, "[^l]Follow Me [as My disciples, accepting Me as your Master and Teacher and walking the same path of life that I walk], and I will make you fishers of men." 















###### 18 







Immediately they left their nets and followed Him [becoming His disciples, believing and trusting in Him and following His example]. 















###### 19 







Going on a little farther, He saw James the son of Zebedee, and his brother John, who were also in the boat mending _and_ cleaning the nets. 















###### 20 







Immediately Jesus called to them; and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired workers, and went away to follow Him [becoming His disciples, believing and trusting in Him and following His example]. 















###### 21 







They went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath Jesus went into the synagogue and _began_ to teach. 















###### 22 







They were completely amazed at His teaching; because He was teaching them as one having [God-given] authority, and not as the scribes. 















###### 23 







Just then there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit; and he cried out [terribly from the depths of his throat], 















###### 24 







saying, "[^m]What business do You have with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are--the Holy One of God!" 















###### 25 







Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be quiet (muzzled, silenced), and come out of him!" 















###### 26 







The unclean spirit threw the man into convulsions, and screeching with a loud voice, came out of him. 















###### 27 







They were all so amazed that they debated _and_ questioned each other, saying, "What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits (demons), and they obey Him." 















###### 28 







Immediately the news about Him spread everywhere throughout the district surrounding Galilee. ## Healing the Crowds 















###### 29 







And immediately they left the synagogue and went into the house of Simon [Peter] and Andrew, accompanied by James and John. 















###### 30 







Now Simon's mother-in-law was lying sick with a fever; and immediately they told Him about her. 















###### 31 







Jesus went to her, and taking her by the hand, raised her up; and the fever left her, and she _began_ to serve them [as her guests]. 















###### 32 







Now when evening came, after the sun had set [and the Sabbath Day had ended, in a steady stream] they were bringing to Him all who were sick and those who were under the power of demons, 















###### 33 







until the whole city had gathered together at the door. 















###### 34 







And Jesus healed many who were suffering with various diseases; and He drove out many demons, but would not allow the demons to speak, because they knew Him [recognizing Him as the Son of God]. 















###### 35 







Early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left [the house], and went out to a secluded place, and was praying there. 















###### 36 







Simon [Peter] and his companions searched [everywhere, looking anxiously] for Him, 















###### 37 







and they found Him and said, "Everybody is looking for You!" 















###### 38 







He replied, "Let us go on to the neighboring towns, so I may preach there also; that is why I came [from the Father]." 















###### 39 







So He went throughout Galilee, preaching [the gospel] in their synagogues and casting out demons. 















###### 40 







And a leper came to Him, begging Him and falling on his knees before Him, saying, "If You are willing, You are able to make me [^n]clean." 















###### 41 







Moved with compassion [for his suffering], Jesus reached out with His hand and touched him, and said to him, "I am willing; be cleansed." 















###### 42 







The leprosy left him immediately and he was cleansed [completely healed and restored to health]. 















###### 43 







And Jesus [deeply moved] admonished him sternly and sent him away immediately, 















###### 44 







saying to him, "See that you tell no one anything [about this]; but go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your purification what Moses commanded, as proof to them [that you are really healed]." 















###### 45 







But he went out and began to proclaim it freely and to spread the news [of his healing], to such an extent that Jesus could no longer openly enter a city [where He was known], but stayed out in the unpopulated places; yet people were still coming to Him from everywhere. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

Since Gentiles would not necessarily be familiar with the Jewish title _Messiah_, he emphasizes instead the fact that Jesus is the Son of God. [^b]: Mark 1:3 A ruler or nobleman traveling in the wilderness would have a crew of workmen preparing and clearing the road ahead of him. In spiritual terms, John the Baptist was clearing the way for the arrival of the Messiah by preparing the hearts of his followers. [^c]: Mark 1:4 Considered the last of the Old Testament prophets, John the Baptist was the son of Zecharias (Zechariah) the priest and his wife, Elizabeth. Elizabeth and Mary, the mother of Jesus, were related (Luke 1:36), and Mary may have been with Elizabeth at the time John was born (Luke 1:56). John the Baptist is not to be confused with John the Apostle who, along with his brother James, was among the twelve disciples of Jesus. [^d]: Mark 1:6 This band (sash, girdle) was about six inches wide and had clasps or fasteners in front. It was used to carry personal items such as a dagger, money or other necessary things. [^e]: Mark 1:8 The Greek here can be translated _with_, _in_, or _by_. [^f]: Mark 1:10 Mark uses the word “immediately” almost forty times in his gospel. [^g]: Mark 1:10 The three persons of the Godhead were present: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. [^h]: Mark 1:11 See note Matt 3:17. [^i]: Mark 1:14 Cf 6:17 ff. [^j]: Mark 1:16 A fresh water lake about 13 miles long and 7 miles wide, almost 700 feet below sea level and center of a busy fishing industry. [^k]: Mark 1:16 One of the followers of John the Baptist (John 1:40). [^l]: Mark 1:17 The concept of “follow” can represent three separate possibilities: in the early stages of His ministry, (1) walking with Him physically (literally), that is merely being in His presence regardless of personal belief or commitment; (2) accepting and identifying with the salvation He offered; and later on (3) being identified with Him by being subject to the scorn and rejection of unbelievers because of personal belief and commitment to Him. [^m]: Mark 1:24 Lit _What to me and to you_, originally a Hebrew idiom which does not translate well into English. The idiom is meant to inform the other person that the speaker is not aware of any obligation between them and does not wish to deal with the other person (cf 2 Sam 16:10). [^n]: Mark 1:40 Lepers were ceremonially unclean according to OT law (Lev 13:45, etc.) and were not to come into physical contact with other people. The leper’s request was the same as asking for healing.

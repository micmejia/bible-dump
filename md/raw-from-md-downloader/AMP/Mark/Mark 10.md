# Mark 10

***
















###### 1 







Getting up, He left there (Capernaum) and went to the region of Judea and beyond the Jordan; and crowds gathered around Him again _and_ accompanied Him, and as was His custom, He once more _began_ to teach them. 















###### 2 







Pharisees came to Jesus to test Him [intending to trick Him into saying something wrong], and asked Him, "Is it lawful [according to Scripture] for a man to divorce his wife _and_ send her away?" 















###### 3 







He replied to them, "What did Moses command you?" 















###### 4 







They said, "Moses allowed _a man_ to write a certificate of divorce and to send her away." 















###### 5 







But Jesus said to them, "Because of your hardness of hearts [your callousness and insensitivity toward your wives and the [^a]provision of God] he wrote you this precept. 















###### 6 







But from the beginning of creation _God_ made them male and female. 















###### 7 







For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother [to establish a home with his wife], 















###### 8 







and the two shall become one flesh; so that they are no longer two, but [are united as] one flesh. 















###### 9 







Therefore, what God has united _and_ joined together, man must not separate [by divorce]." 















###### 10 







In the house the disciples _began_ questioning Him again about this. 















###### 11 







And He said to them, "Whoever divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her; 















###### 12 







and if a woman divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery." ## Jesus Blesses Little Children 















###### 13 







People were bringing children to Him so that He would touch _and_ bless them, but the disciples reprimanded them _and_ discouraged them [from coming]. 















###### 14 







But when Jesus saw this, He was indignant and He said to them, "Allow the children to come to Me; do not forbid them; for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. 















###### 15 







I assure you _and_ most solemnly say to you, whoever does not receive _and_ welcome the kingdom of God like a child will not enter it at all." 















###### 16 







And He took the children [one by one] in His arms and [^b]blessed them [with kind, encouraging words], placing His hands on them. ## The Rich Young Ruler 















###### 17 







As He was leaving on His journey, a man ran up and knelt before Him and asked Him, "Good Teacher [You who are essentially good and morally perfect], what shall I do to inherit eternal life [that is, eternal salvation in the Messiah's kingdom]?" 















###### 18 







Jesus said to him, "[^c]Why do you call Me good? No one is [essentially] good [by nature] except God alone. 















###### 19 







You know the commandments: 'Do not murder, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not testify falsely, Do not defraud, Honor your father and mother.'" 















###### 20 







And he replied to Him, "Teacher, I have [carefully] kept all these [commandments] since my [^d]youth." 















###### 21 







Looking at him, Jesus felt a love (high regard, compassion) for him, and He said to him, "You lack one thing: go and sell all your property and give [the money] to the poor, and you will have [abundant] treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me [becoming My disciple, believing and trusting in Me and walking the same path of life that I walk]." 















###### 22 







But the man was saddened at Jesus' words, and he left grieving, because he owned much property _and_ had many possessions [which he treasured more than his relationship with God]. 















###### 23 







Jesus looked around and said to His disciples, "How difficult it will be for those who are wealthy [and cling to possessions and status as security] to enter the kingdom of God!" 















###### 24 







The disciples were [^e]amazed _and_ bewildered by His words. But Jesus said to them again, "Children, how difficult it is [for those who place their hope and confidence in riches] to enter the kingdom of God! 















###### 25 







It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man [who places his faith in wealth or status] to enter the kingdom of God." 















###### 26 







They were completely _and_ utterly astonished, and said to Him, "Then who can be saved [from the wrath of God]?" 















###### 27 







Looking at them, Jesus said, "With people [as far as it depends on them] it is impossible, but not with God; for all things are possible with God." 















###### 28 







Peter started saying to Him, "Look, we have given up everything and followed You [becoming Your disciples and accepting You as Teacher and Lord]." 















###### 29 







Jesus said, "I assure you _and_ most solemnly say to you, there is no one who has given up a house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or farms, for My sake and for the gospel's sake, 















###### 30 







who will not receive a hundred times as much now in the present age--houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and farms--along with persecutions; and in the age to come, eternal life. 















###### 31 







But many _who are_ first will be last, and the last, first." ## Jesus' Sufferings Foretold 















###### 32 







Now they were on the road going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking on ahead of them; and they were perplexed [at what Jesus had said], and those who were following were alarmed _and_ afraid. And again He took the twelve [disciples] aside and began telling them what was going to happen to Him, 















###### 33 







_saying_, "Listen very carefully: we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be betrayed _and_ handed over to the chief priests and the scribes; and they will condemn Him to death and hand Him over to the Gentiles (Romans). 















###### 34 







They will mock _and_ ridicule Him and spit on Him, and whip (scourge) Him and kill _Him_, and three days later He will rise [from the dead]." 















###### 35 







James and John, the two sons of Zebedee, came to Him, saying, "Teacher, we want You to do for us whatever we ask of You." 















###### 36 







And He replied to them, "What do you want Me to do for you?" 















###### 37 







They said to Him, "Grant that we may sit [with You], one on Your right and one on _Your_ left, in Your glory [Your majesty and splendor in Your kingdom]." 















###### 38 







But Jesus said to them, "You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism [of suffering and death] with which I am baptized?" 















###### 39 







And they replied to Him, "We are able." Jesus told them, "The cup that I drink you will drink, and you will be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized. 















###### 40 







But to sit on My right or left, this is not Mine to give; but it is for those for whom it has been prepared [by My Father]." 















###### 41 







Hearing this, the [other] ten became indignant with James and John. 















###### 42 







Calling them to Himself, Jesus said to them, "You know that those who are recognized as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them; and their powerful men exercise authority over them [tyrannizing them]. 















###### 43 







But this is not how it is among you; instead, whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant, 















###### 44 







and whoever wishes to be first _and_ most important among you must be slave of all. 















###### 45 







For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a [^f]ransom for many." ## Bartimaeus Receives His Sight 















###### 46 







Then they came to Jericho. And as He was leaving Jericho with His disciples and a large crowd, a blind beggar, Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, was sitting beside the road [as was his custom]. 















###### 47 







When Bartimaeus heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout and say, "Jesus, [^g]Son of David (Messiah), have mercy on me!" 















###### 48 







Many sternly rebuked him, telling him to keep still _and_ be quiet; but he kept on shouting out all the more, "Son of David (Messiah), have mercy on me!" 















###### 49 







Jesus stopped and said, "Call him." So they called the blind man, telling him, "Take courage, get up! He is calling for you." 















###### 50 







Throwing his cloak aside, he jumped up and came to Jesus. 















###### 51 







And Jesus said, "What do you want Me to do for you?" The blind man said to Him, "Rabboni (my Master), let me regain my sight." 















###### 52 







Jesus said to him, "Go; your faith [and confident trust in My power] has made you well." Immediately he regained his sight and _began_ following Jesus on the road. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: Mark 10:16 The basic meaning of the Greek word found here for “blessed” is to speak kindly of someone. Jesus was probably giving the children encouragement as only He could, with His infallible knowledge of each child’s future. [^c]: Mark 10:18 Jesus was affirming His deity by challenging the man to recognize Him as Messiah. [^d]: Mark 10:20 After reaching the age of thirteen a Jewish boy was personally responsible for keeping the Law. [^e]: Mark 10:24 What Jesus said ran contrary to the conventional wisdom among the Jews (and other ancient peoples). It was commonly thought that wealthy people who did their duty financially to the poor and their community were assured entry into the kingdom of God. [^f]: Mark 10:45 I.e. to die so that believers may be freed from the power of sin and death. [^g]: Mark 10:47 A common Messianic title recognizing the Messiah as a descendant of David.

# Mark 12

***
















###### 1 







Jesus began to speak to them [the chief priests, scribes and elders who were questioning Him] in parables: "A man planted a vineyard and put a [^a]wall around it, and dug a pit for the wine press and built a tower; and he rented it out to tenant farmers and left the country. 















###### 2 







When the _harvest_ season came he sent a [^b]servant to the tenants, in order to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard. 















###### 3 







They took him and beat him and sent him away empty-handed. 















###### 4 







Again he sent them another servant, and they [threw stones and] wounded him in the head, and treated him disgracefully. 















###### 5 







And he sent another, and that one they killed; then many others--some they beat and some they killed. 















###### 6 







He still had one man left _to send_, a beloved son; he sent him last of all to them, saying, 'They will respect my son.' 















###### 7 







But those tenants said to each other, 'This _man_ is the heir! Come on, let us kill him [and destroy the evidence], and his inheritance will be ours!' 















###### 8 







So they took him and killed him, and threw his body outside the vineyard. 















###### 9 







What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenants, and will give the vineyard to others. 















###### 10 







Have you not even read this Scripture: 'The stone which the builders regarded as unworthy _and_ rejected, This [very stone] has become the chief Cornerstone 















###### 11 







This came about from the Lord, And it is marvelous _and_ wonderful in our eyes'?" 















###### 12 







And they were looking for a way to seize Him, but they were afraid of the crowd; for they knew that He spoke this parable in reference to [and as a charge against] them. And so they left Him and went away. ## Jesus Answers the Pharisees, Sadducees and Scribes 















###### 13 







Then they sent some of the [^c]Pharisees and Herodians to Jesus in order to trap Him into _making_ a statement [that they could use against Him]. 















###### 14 







They came and said to Him, "Teacher, we know that You are truthful and have no personal bias toward anyone; for You are not influenced by outward appearances _or_ social status, but in truth You teach the way of God. Is it lawful [according to Jewish law and tradition] to pay the [^d]poll-tax to [[^e]Tiberius] Caesar, or not? 















###### 15 







Should we pay [the tax] or should we not pay?" But knowing their hypocrisy, He asked them, "Why are you testing Me? Bring Me a [^f]coin (denarius) to look at." 















###### 16 







So they brought one. Then He asked them, "Whose image and inscription is this?" They said to Him, "Caesar's." 















###### 17 







Jesus said to them, "Pay to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's." And they were greatly amazed at Him. 















###### 18 







Some Sadducees **(**who say that there is no resurrection**)** came to Him, and _began_ questioning Him, saying, 















###### 19 







"Teacher, Moses wrote for us [a law] that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but leaves no child, his brother is to [^g]marry the widow and raise up children for his brother. 















###### 20 







There were seven brothers; the first [one] took a wife, and died leaving no children. 















###### 21 







The second brother married her, and died leaving no children; and the third likewise; 















###### 22 







and so all seven [married her and died, and] left no children. Last of all the woman died also. 















###### 23 







In the resurrection, whose wife will she be? For all seven [brothers] were married to her." 















###### 24 







Jesus said to them, "Is this not why you are wrong, because you know neither the Scriptures [that teach the resurrection] nor the power of God [who is able to raise the dead]? 















###### 25 







For when they rise from the dead, they do not marry nor are they given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven. 















###### 26 







But concerning the raising of the dead, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the _passage_ about the _burning_ bush, how God spoke to him, saying, 'I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? 















###### 27 







He is not the God of the dead, but of the living; you are greatly mistaken _and_ you are deceiving yourselves!" 















###### 28 







Then one of the scribes [an expert in Mosaic Law] came up and listened to them arguing [with one another], and noticing that Jesus answered them well, asked Him, "Which commandment is first _and_ most important of all?" 















###### 29 







Jesus answered, "The first _and_ most important _one_ is: 'Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord; 















###### 30 







and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul (life), and with all your mind (thought, understanding), and with all your strength.' 















###### 31 







This is the second: 'You shall [unselfishly] [^h]love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no other commandment greater than these." 















###### 32 







The scribe said to Him, "Admirably answered, Teacher; You truthfully stated that He is One, and there is no other but Him; 















###### 33 







and to love Him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the strength, and to [unselfishly] love one's neighbor as oneself, is much more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices." 















###### 34 







When Jesus saw that he answered thoughtfully _and_ intelligently, He said to him, "You are not far from the kingdom of God." And after that, no one would dare to ask Him any more questions. 















###### 35 







Jesus _began_ to say, as He taught in [a portico or court of] the temple, "[^i]How can the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David? 















###### 36 







David himself said [when inspired] by the Holy Spirit, 'The Lord (the Father) said to my Lord (the Son, the Messiah), "Sit at My right hand, Until I put Your enemies under Your feet."' 















###### 37 







David himself calls Him (the Son, the Messiah) 'Lord'; so how can it be that He is [^j]David's Son?" The large crowd enjoyed hearing Jesus _and_ listened to Him with delight. 















###### 38 







In [the course of] His teaching He was saying, "Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes [displaying their prominence], and _like to receive_ respectful greetings in the market places, 















###### 39 







and [they love] the [^k]chief seats in the synagogues and the places of distinction _and_ honor at banquets, 















###### 40 







[these scribes] who devour (confiscate) widows' houses, and offer long prayers for appearance's sake [to impress others]. These men will receive greater condemnation." ## The Widow's Mite 















###### 41 







And He sat down opposite the [temple] treasury, and _began_ watching how the people were putting money into the [^l]treasury. And many rich people were putting in [^m]large sums. 















###### 42 







A poor widow came and put in two small copper coins, which amount to a [^n]mite. 















###### 43 







Calling His disciples to Him, He said to them, "I assure you _and_ most solemnly say to you, this poor widow put in [proportionally] more than all the contributors to the treasury. 















###### 44 







For they all contributed from their surplus, but she, from her poverty, put in all she had, all she had to live on." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: Mark 12:2 The servants represent the prophets sent to Israel by God. [^c]: Mark 12:13 This was an unlikely alliance since the Pharisees were a strict religious sect while the Herodians were not religious and supported the rule of Caesar. [^d]: Mark 12:14 Every Jew was required to pay the poll-tax. It was considered a sign of subservience to Rome. [^e]: Mark 12:14 See note Matt 22:21. [^f]: Mark 12:15 A day’s wages for a laborer. [^g]: Mark 12:19 The purpose of this was to carry on the family line and keep property within the family. [^h]: Mark 12:31 The key to understanding this and other statements about love is to know that this love (the Greek word _agape_) is not so much a matter of emotion as it is of doing things for the benefit of another person, that is, having an unselfish concern for another and a willingness to seek the best for another. [^i]: Mark 12:35 It is no coincidence that Jesus raises this question after His preceding discussion with the lawyer/scribe. Matthew (22:35) notes that the lawyer had questioned Jesus to test Him. His goal was to extract from Jesus the admission that there is only one God (see v 32), and eventually to use that admission against Him when He claimed to be the Son of God and therefore God Himself. In reality, Jesus had admitted nothing that posed a problem for the concept of one God existing as three distinct Persons, and He drew attention to this fact by raising the issue of David’s relationship to the Messiah. [^j]: Mark 12:37 Lit _his_. [^k]: Mark 12:39 These seats were located near the scrolls of the Law, facing the congregation in the synagogue. [^l]: Mark 12:41 Thirteen trumpet-shaped chests were placed around the wall in the Court of Women in the temple. [^m]: Mark 12:41 The thirteen receptacles for the money were metal and the heavy silver coins contributed by the wealthy would have made quite a noise when they were deposited, calling audible attention to the size of each contribution. By contrast, the widow’s coins (v 42) would have barely made a sound. [^n]: Mark 12:42 The least valuable Roman coin, which amounted to only one sixty-fourth of a day’s wages for a laborer; traditionally called the “widow’s mite.”

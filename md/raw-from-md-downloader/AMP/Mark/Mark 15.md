# Mark 15

***
















###### 1 







Early in the morning the chief priests, with the elders and scribes and the whole Council (Sanhedrin, Jewish High Court), immediately consulted together; and they bound Jesus, they took Him away [violently] and handed Him over to Pilate. 















###### 2 







Pilate questioned Him, "Are You the King of the Jews?" And He replied to him, "It is as you say." 















###### 3 







The chief priests _began_ accusing Him of many things. 















###### 4 







Then Pilate again asked Him, "Have You no answer [to give]? See how many charges they are bringing against You!" 















###### 5 







But Jesus gave no further answer; so Pilate was perplexed. 















###### 6 







Now at the [Passover] feast Pilate used to set free for them any one prisoner whom they requested. 















###### 7 







The man called Barabbas was imprisoned with the insurrectionists (revolutionaries) who had committed murder in the civil rebellion. 















###### 8 







The crowd came up and began asking Pilate to do as he usually did for them. 















###### 9 







Pilate answered them, saying, "Do you want me to set free for you the King of the Jews?" 















###### 10 







For he was aware that the chief priests had turned Jesus over to him because of envy _and_ resentment. 















###### 11 







But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to get him to release Barabbas for them instead. 















###### 12 







Again Pilate answered, "Then what shall I do with Him whom you call the King of the Jews?" 















###### 13 







They screamed back, "Crucify Him!" 















###### 14 







But Pilate asked them, "Why, what has He done that is evil?" But they screamed all the more, "Crucify Him!" 















###### 15 







So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, set Barabbas free for them; and after having Jesus [^a]scourged, he handed Him over [to his soldiers] to be crucified. ## Jesus Is Mocked 















###### 16 







The soldiers led Him away into the palace **(**that is, the [^b]Praetorium**)**, and they called together the entire [Roman] battalion [of 600 soldiers]. 















###### 17 







They dressed Him up in [a ranking Roman officer's robe of] purple, and after twisting [together] a crown of thorns, they placed it on Him; 















###### 18 







and they began saluting _and_ mocking Him: "Hail, King of the Jews!" 















###### 19 







They kept beating Him on the head with a [^c]reed and spitting on Him, and kneeling and bowing in [mock] homage to Him. 















###### 20 







After they had mocked Him, they took off the purple robe and put His own clothes on Him. And they led Him out [of the city] to crucify Him. 















###### 21 







They forced into service a passer-by coming in from the countryside, Simon of [^d]Cyrene **(**the father of Alexander and Rufus**)**, [^e]to carry His cross. ## The Crucifixion 















###### 22 







Then they brought Him to the place [called] Golgotha, which is translated, Place of a [^f]Skull. 















###### 23 







They tried to give Him [^g]wine mixed with myrrh [to dull the pain], but He would not take it. 















###### 24 







And they crucified Him, and [^h]divided up His clothes among themselves, casting lots for them to see who should take what. 















###### 25 







It was the third hour (9:00 a.m.) when they crucified Him. 















###### 26 







The inscription of the accusation against Him had been written [above Him]: "THE KING OF THE JEWS." 















###### 27 







They crucified two robbers with Him, one on His right and one on His left. 















###### 28 







[^i][And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, "He was counted with the transgressors."] 















###### 29 







Those who were passing by were insulting Him with abusive _and_ insolent language, wagging their heads [as a sign of contempt], and saying, "Ha! You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in [only] three days, 















###### 30 







save Yourself by coming down from the cross!" 















###### 31 







In the same way the chief priests also, along with the scribes, were ridiculing _and_ mocking _Him_ among themselves and saying, "He saved others [from death]; He cannot save Himself! 















###### 32 







Let the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed), the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, so that we may see and believe _and_ trust [in Him]!" Those who were crucified with Him were also insulting Him. 















###### 33 







When the sixth hour (noon) came, darkness covered the whole land until the ninth hour (3:00 p.m.). 















###### 34 







And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?"--which is translated, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" 















###### 35 







Some of the bystanders heard Him and said, "Look! He is calling for [^j]Elijah!" 















###### 36 







Someone ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on a reed and gave Him a drink, saying, "Let us see whether Elijah is coming to take Him down." 















###### 37 







But Jesus uttered a loud cry, and breathed out His last [voluntarily, sovereignly dismissing and releasing His spirit from His body in submission to His Father's plan]. 















###### 38 







And the veil [of the Holy of Holies] of the temple was torn in two from [^k]top to bottom. 















###### 39 







When the centurion, who was standing opposite Him, saw the way He breathed His last [being fully in control], he said, "Truly this man was the Son of God!" 















###### 40 







Now some women also were watching from a distance, among whom were Mary Magdalene, and [^l]Mary the mother of James the Less and of Joses, and [^m]Salome. 















###### 41 







When Jesus was in Galilee, they used to accompany him and minister to Him; and _there were_ also many other women who came up with Him to Jerusalem. ## Jesus Is Buried 















###### 42 







When evening had already come, because it was the preparation day, that is, the day before the Sabbath, 















###### 43 







Joseph of Arimathea came, a prominent _and_ respected member of the Council (Sanhedrin, Jewish High Court), who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God--and he courageously dared to go in before Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. 















###### 44 







Pilate [^n]wondered if He was dead by this time [only six hours after being crucified], and he summoned the centurion and asked him whether He was already dead. 















###### 45 







And when he learned from the centurion [that Jesus was in fact dead], he gave the body to Joseph [by granting him permission to remove it]. 















###### 46 







So Joseph purchased a [fine] linen cloth [for [^o]wrapping the body], and after taking Jesus down [from the cross], he wrapped Him in the linen cloth and placed Him in a tomb which had been cut out of rock. Then he rolled a [large, wheel-shaped] stone against the entrance of the tomb. 















###### 47 







Mary Magdalene and Mary the _mother_ of Joses were [carefully] watching to see where He was laid. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

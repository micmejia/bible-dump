# Mark 16

***
















###### 1 







When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the _mother_ of James, and Salome purchased [sweet-smelling] spices, so that they might go and [^a]anoint Him. 















###### 2 







Very early on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb when the sun had risen. 















###### 3 







And they were saying to one another, "Who will roll back the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?" 















###### 4 







Looking up, they saw that the stone had been rolled away, though it was extremely large. 















###### 5 







Entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right, wearing a [long, stately] white robe; and they were amazed _and_ bewildered. 















###### 6 







And he said to them, "Do not be amazed; you are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen; He is not here. See, [here is] the place where they laid Him. 















###### 7 







But go, tell His disciples and Peter, 'He is going ahead of you to Galilee; you will see Him there, just as He told you.'" 















###### 8 







They went out and fled from the tomb, for they were seized with trembling and astonishment; and they said nothing [about it] to anyone, because they were afraid. 















###### 9 







[^b][Now Jesus, having risen [from death] early on the first day of the week, appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom He had cast out seven demons. 















###### 10 







She went and reported it to those who had been with Him, while they were mourning and weeping. 















###### 11 







When they heard that He was alive and had been seen by her, they did not believe it. 















###### 12 







After that, He appeared in a different form to two of them as they were walking along the way to the country. 















###### 13 







They returned [to Jerusalem] and told the others, but they did not believe them either. ## The Disciples Commissioned 















###### 14 







Later, Jesus appeared to the eleven [disciples] themselves as they were reclining _at the table_; and He called them to account for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not believed those who had seen Him after He had risen [from death]. 















###### 15 







And He said to them, "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation. 















###### 16 







He who has believed [in Me] and has been baptized will be saved [from the penalty of God's wrath and judgment]; but he who has not believed will be condemned. 















###### 17 







These signs will accompany those who have believed: in My name they will cast out demons, they will speak in new tongues; 















###### 18 







they will pick up serpents, and if they drink anything deadly, it will not hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will get well." 















###### 19 







So then, when the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, He was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God. 















###### 20 







And they went out and preached everywhere, while the Lord was working with them and confirming the word by the signs that followed.] ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

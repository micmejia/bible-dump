# Mark 3

***
















###### 1 







Again Jesus went into a synagogue; and a man was there whose hand was [^a]withered. 















###### 2 







The Pharisees were watching Jesus _closely to see_ if He would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse Him [in the Jewish high court]. 















###### 3 







He said to the man whose hand was withered, "Get up and come forward!" 















###### 4 







He asked them, "Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save a life or to kill?" But they kept silent. 















###### 5 







After looking around at them with anger, grieved at the hardness _and_ arrogance of their hearts, He told the man, "Hold out your hand." And he held it out, and his hand was [completely] restored. 















###### 6 







Then the Pharisees went out and immediately _began_ conspiring with the [^b]Herodians [to plot] against Him, as to how [^c]they might [fabricate some legal grounds to] put Him to death. 















###### 7 







Jesus withdrew to the sea with His disciples; and a large crowd from Galilee followed Him; and _also people_ from Judea, 















###### 8 







and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and [from the region] beyond the Jordan, and around Tyre and Sidon; a vast number of people came to Him because they were hearing about all [the things] that He was doing. 















###### 9 







And He told His disciples to have a small boat stand ready for Him because of the many people, so that they would not crowd Him; 















###### 10 







for He had healed many, and as a result all who had diseases pressed around Him to touch Him. 















###### 11 







Whenever the unclean spirits saw Him, they fell down before Him and screamed out, "You are the Son of God!" 















###### 12 







Jesus sternly warned them [again and again] not to tell who He was. ## The Twelve Are Chosen 















###### 13 







He went up on the hillside and called those whom He Himself wanted _and_ chose; and they came to Him. 















###### 14 







And He appointed [^d]twelve [disciples], so that they would be with Him [for instruction] and so that He could send them out to preach [the gospel as apostles--that is, as His special messengers, personally chosen representatives], 















###### 15 







and to have authority _and_ power to cast out demons. 















###### 16 







He appointed the twelve: Simon **(**to whom He gave the name Peter**)**, 















###### 17 







and James, the son of [^e]Zebedee, and John the brother of James **(**to them He gave the name Boanerges, that is, "Sons of Thunder"**)**; 















###### 18 







and [He also appointed] Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew (Nathanael), and Matthew (Levi the tax collector), and Thomas, and [^f]James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus (Judas the son of James), and Simon the Zealot; 















###### 19 







and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Him. 















###### 20 







Then He came to a [^g]house [in Capernaum], and a crowd formed again, so [many people] that Jesus and His disciples could not even eat a meal [together]. 















###### 21 







When His own family heard this they went to take custody of Him; for they were saying, "He is out of His mind." 















###### 22 







The scribes who came down from Jerusalem were saying, "He is possessed by [^h]Beelzebul (Satan)," and "He is driving out the demons by the [power of the] ruler of the demons." 















###### 23 







So He called them to Himself and spoke to them in [^i]parables, "How can Satan drive out Satan? 















###### 24 







If a kingdom is divided [split into factions and rebelling] against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. 















###### 25 







And if a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand. 















###### 26 







And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but is coming to an end. 















###### 27 







But no one can go into a strong man's house and steal his property unless he first overpowers _and_ ties up the strong man, and then he will ransack _and_ rob his house. 















###### 28 







"I assure you _and_ most solemnly say to you, all sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and all the abusive _and_ blasphemous things they say; 















###### 29 







but whoever [^j]blasphemes against the Holy Spirit _and_ His power [by attributing the miracles done by Me to Satan] never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an everlasting sin [a sin which is unforgivable in this present age as well as in the age to come]"-- 















###### 30 







[Jesus said this] because the scribes and Pharisees were [attributing His miracles to Satan by] saying, "He has an unclean spirit." 















###### 31 







Then His mother and His brothers arrived, and standing outside they sent _word_ to Him and called for Him. 















###### 32 







A crowd was sitting around Him, and they said to Him, "Look! Your mother and Your brothers are outside asking for You." 















###### 33 







And He replied, "Who are My mother and My brothers?" 















###### 34 







Looking at those who were sitting in a circle around Him, He said, "Here are My mother and My brothers! 















###### 35 







For [^k]whoever does the will of God [by believing in Me, and following Me], he is My brother and sister and mother." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

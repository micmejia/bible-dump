# Mark 5

***
















###### 1 







They came to the [^a]other side of the sea, to the region of the Gerasenes. 















###### 2 







When Jesus got out of the boat, immediately a man from the tombs with an unclean spirit met Him, 















###### 3 







and the man lived in the [^b]tombs, and no one could bind him anymore, not even with chains. 















###### 4 







For he had often been bound with shackles [for the feet] and with chains, and he tore apart the chains and broke the shackles into pieces, and no one was strong enough to subdue _and_ tame him. 















###### 5 







Night and day he was constantly screaming _and_ shrieking among the tombs and on the mountains, and cutting himself with [sharp] stones. 















###### 6 







Seeing Jesus from a distance, he ran up and bowed down before Him [in homage]; 















###### 7 







and screaming with a loud voice, he said, "[^c]What business do we have in common with each other, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I implore you by God [swear to me], do not torment me!" 















###### 8 







For Jesus had been saying to him, "Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!" 















###### 9 







He was asking him, "What is your name?" And he replied, "My name is Legion; for we are many." 















###### 10 







And he _began_ begging Him repeatedly not to send them out of the region. 















###### 11 







Now there was a large herd of pigs grazing there on the mountain. 















###### 12 







And _the demons_ begged Him, saying, "Send us to the pigs so that we may go into them!" 















###### 13 







Jesus gave them permission. And the unclean spirits came out [of the man] and entered the pigs. The herd, numbering about two thousand, rushed down the steep bank into the sea; and they were drowned [one after the other] in the sea. 















###### 14 







The herdsmen [tending the pigs] ran away and reported it in the city and in the country. And _the people_ came to see what had happened. 















###### 15 







They came to Jesus and saw the man who had been demon-possessed sitting down, clothed and in his right mind, the man who had [previously] had the "legion" [of demons]; and they were frightened. 















###### 16 







Those who had seen it described [in detail] to the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man, and [told them all] about the pigs. 















###### 17 







So the people began to beg with Jesus to leave their region. 















###### 18 







As He was stepping into the boat, the [Gentile] man who had been demon-possessed was begging with Him [asking] that he might go with Him [as a disciple]. 















###### 19 







Jesus did not let him [come], but [instead] He said to him, "Go home to your family and tell them all the great things that the Lord has done for you, and how He has had mercy on you." 















###### 20 







So he [obeyed and] went away and began to publicly proclaim in Decapolis [the region of the ten Hellenistic cities] all the great things that Jesus had done for him; and all the people were astonished. ## Miracles and Healing 















###### 21 







When Jesus had again crossed over in the boat to the other side [of the sea], a large crowd gathered around Him; and so He stayed by the seashore. 















###### 22 







One of the synagogue officials named Jairus came up; and seeing Him, fell at His feet 















###### 23 







and begged anxiously with Him, saying, "My little daughter is at the point of death; [please] come and lay Your hands on her, so that she will be healed and live." 















###### 24 







And Jesus went with him; and a large crowd followed Him and pressed in around Him [from all sides]. 















###### 25 







A woman [in the crowd] had [suffered from] a hemorrhage for twelve years, 















###### 26 







and had endured much [suffering] at the hands of many physicians. She had spent all that she had and was not helped at all, but instead had become worse. 















###### 27 







She had heard [reports] about Jesus, and she came up behind Him in the crowd and touched His outer robe. 















###### 28 







For she thought, "If I just touch His clothing, I will get well." 















###### 29 







Immediately her flow of blood was dried up; and she felt in her body [and knew without any doubt] that she was healed of her suffering. 















###### 30 







Immediately Jesus, recognizing in Himself that power had gone out from Him, turned around in the crowd and asked, "Who touched My clothes?" 















###### 31 







His disciples said to Him, "You see the crowd pressing in around You [from all sides], and You ask, 'Who touched Me?'" 















###### 32 







Still He kept looking around to see the woman who had done it. 















###### 33 







And the woman, though she was afraid and trembling, aware of what had happened to her, came and fell down before Him and told Him the whole truth. 















###### 34 







Then He said to her, "Daughter, your faith [your personal trust and confidence in Me] has restored you to health; go in peace and be [permanently] healed from your suffering." 















###### 35 







While He was still speaking, some people came from the synagogue official's house, saying [to Jairus], "Your daughter has died; why bother the Teacher any longer?" 















###### 36 







Overhearing what was being said, Jesus said to the synagogue official, "Do not be afraid; only keep on believing [in Me and my power]." 















###### 37 







And He allowed no one to go with Him [as witnesses], except Peter and [^d]James and John the brother of James. 















###### 38 







They came to the house of the synagogue official; and He looked [with understanding] at the uproar _and_ commotion, and people loudly weeping and wailing [in mourning]. 















###### 39 







When He had gone in, He said to them, "Why make a commotion and weep? The child has not died, but is sleeping." 















###### 40 







They _began_ laughing [scornfully] at Him [because they knew the child was dead]. But He made them all [^e]go outside, and took along the child's father and mother and His own [three] companions, and entered _the room_ where the child was. 















###### 41 







Taking the child's hand, He said [tenderly] to her, "Talitha kum!"--which translated [from Aramaic] means, "Little girl, I say to you, get up!" 















###### 42 







The little girl immediately got up and _began_ to walk, for she was twelve years old. And immediately they [who witnessed the child's resurrection] were overcome with great wonder _and_ utter amazement. 















###### 43 







He gave strict orders that no one should know about this, and He told them to give her _something_ to eat. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

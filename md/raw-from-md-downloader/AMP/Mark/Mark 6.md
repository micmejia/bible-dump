# Mark 6

***
















###### 1 







Jesus left there and came to His hometown [Nazareth]; and His disciples followed Him. 















###### 2 







When the Sabbath came, He began to teach in the synagogue; and many who listened to Him were astonished, saying, "Where did this man get these things [this knowledge and spiritual insight]? What is this wisdom [this confident understanding of the Scripture] that has been given to Him, and such miracles as these performed by His hands? 















###### 3 







Is this not the carpenter, [^a]the son of Mary, and the brother of [^b]James and Joses and [^c]Judas and Simon? Are His sisters not here with us?" And they were [deeply] offended by Him [and their disapproval blinded them to the fact that He was anointed by God as the Messiah]. 















###### 4 







Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor (respect) except in his hometown and among his relatives and in his own household." 















###### 5 







And He could not do a miracle there at all [because of their unbelief] except that He laid His hands on a few sick people and healed them. 















###### 6 







He wondered at their unbelief. And He was going around in the villages teaching. ## The Twelve Sent Out 















###### 7 







And He called the twelve [disciples] and began to send them out [as His special messengers] two by two, and gave them authority _and_ power over the unclean spirits. 















###### 8 







He told them to take nothing for the journey except a mere walking stick--no bread, no [traveler's] bag, no money in their belts-- 















###### 9 







but to wear sandals; and [He told them] not to wear [^d]two tunics. 















###### 10 







And He told them, "Wherever you go into a house, stay there until you leave that town. 















###### 11 







Any place that does not welcome you or listen to you, when you leave there, [^e]shake the dust off the soles of your feet as a testimony against them [breaking all ties with them because they rejected My message]." 















###### 12 







So they went out and preached that men should repent [that is, think differently, recognize sin, turn away from it, and live changed lives]. 















###### 13 







And they were casting out many demons and were anointing with oil many who were sick, and healing them. ## John's Fate Recalled 















###### 14 







King Herod [Antipas] heard about this, for Jesus' name _and_ reputation had become well known. People were saying, "John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why these miraculous powers are at work in Him." 















###### 15 







But others were saying, "He is [^f]Elijah!" And others were saying, "It is a prophet, like one of the prophets [of old]." 















###### 16 







But when Herod heard [of it], he kept saying, "John, whom I beheaded, has risen [from the dead]!" 















###### 17 







For Herod himself had sent [guards] and had John arrested and shackled in prison because of [^g]Herodias, the wife of his [half-] brother Philip, because he (Herod) had married her. 















###### 18 







For John had been saying to Herod, "It is not lawful [under Mosaic Law] for you to have your brother's wife." 















###### 19 







Herodias had a grudge against John and wanted to kill him, but she could not, 















###### 20 







because Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he _continually_ kept him safe. When he heard John [speak], he was very perplexed; but he enjoyed listening to him. 















###### 21 







But an opportune time [finally] came [for Herodias]. Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his officials (nobles, courtiers) and [^h]military commanders and the leading men of Galilee. 















###### 22 







Now [Salome] the daughter of Herodias came in and danced [for the men]. She pleased _and_ beguiled Herod and his dinner guests; and the king said to the [^i]girl, "Ask me for whatever you want and I will give it to you." 















###### 23 







And he swore to her, "Whatever you ask me, I will give it to you; [^j]up to half of my kingdom." 















###### 24 







She went out and said to her mother, "What shall I ask for?" And Herodias replied, "The head of John the Baptist!" 















###### 25 







And she rushed back to the king and asked, saying, "I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter!" 















###### 26 







The king was deeply grieved, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests [who might have regarded him as weak], he was unwilling to [break his word and] refuse her. 















###### 27 







So the king immediately sent for an executioner and commanded him to bring back John's head. And he went and had John beheaded in the prison, 















###### 28 







and brought back his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to her mother. 















###### 29 







When his disciples heard _about this_, they came and took away John's body and laid it in a tomb. ## Five Thousand Fed 















###### 30 







The apostles [who had been sent out on a mission] gathered together with Jesus and told Him everything that they had done and taught. 















###### 31 







He said to them, "Come away by yourselves to a secluded place and rest a little while"--for there were many [people who were continually] coming and going, and they could not even find time to eat. 















###### 32 







And they went away by themselves in the boat to a secluded place. 















###### 33 







Many [people] saw them leaving, and recognized _them_ and ran there together on foot from all the [surrounding] cities, and got there ahead of them. 















###### 34 







When Jesus went ashore, He saw a large crowd [waiting], and He was moved with compassion for them because they were like sheep without a shepherd [lacking guidance]; and He began to teach them many things. 















###### 35 







When the day was nearly gone, His disciples came to Him and said, "This is an isolated place, and it is already late; 















###### 36 







send the crowds away so that they may go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat." 















###### 37 







But He replied, "You give them something to eat!" And they asked Him, "Shall we go and buy 200 [^k]denarii worth of bread and give it to them to eat?" 















###### 38 







He said to them, "How many loaves do you have? Go look!" And when they found out, they said, "Five [loaves], and two fish." 















###### 39 







Then Jesus commanded them all to sit down by groups on the green grass. 















###### 40 







They sat down in groups of hundreds and of fifties [so that the crowd resembled an orderly arrangement of colorful garden plots]. 















###### 41 







Taking the five loaves and two fish, He looked up to heaven and said a blessing [of praise and thanksgiving to the Father]. Then He broke the loaves and [repeatedly] gave them to the disciples to set before the people; and He divided up the two fish among them all. 















###### 42 







They all ate and were satisfied. 















###### 43 







And the disciples picked up twelve full baskets of the broken pieces [of the loaves], and of the fish. 















###### 44 







Those who ate the loaves were five thousand men [not counting the women and children]. ## Jesus Walks on the Water 















###### 45 







Jesus immediately insisted that His disciples get into the boat and go ahead [of Him] to the other side to Bethsaida, while He was dismissing the crowd. 















###### 46 







And after He said goodbye to them, He went to the mountain to pray. 















###### 47 







Now when evening had come, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and Jesus was alone on the land. 















###### 48 







Seeing the disciples straining at the oars, because the wind was against them, at about the fourth watch of the night (3:00-6:00 a.m.) He came to them, walking on the sea. And [acted as if] He intended to pass by them. 















###### 49 







But when they saw Him walking on the sea, they thought it was a ghost, and cried out [in horror]; 















###### 50 







for they all saw Him and were shaken _and_ terrified. But He immediately spoke with them and said, "Take courage! It is I (I Am)! Stop being afraid." 















###### 51 







Then He got into the boat with them, and the wind ceased [as if exhausted by its own activity]; and they were completely overwhelmed, 















###### 52 







because they had not understood [the miracle of] the loaves [how it revealed the power and deity of Jesus]; but [in fact] their heart was hardened [being oblivious and indifferent to His amazing works]. ## Healing at Gennesaret 















###### 53 







When they had crossed over [the sea], they reached the land of Gennesaret and anchored at the shore. 















###### 54 







They got out of the boat and immediately _people_ recognized Him, 















###### 55 







and ran throughout that surrounding countryside and began to carry around on their mats those who were sick, to any place where they heard He was. 















###### 56 







And wherever He came into villages, or cities, or the countryside, they were laying the sick in the market places and pleading with Him [to allow them] just to touch the fringe (tassel with a blue cord) of His robe; and all who touched it were healed. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: Mark 6:3 James later became a leader in the Jerusalem church and authored the epistle of James. [^c]: Mark 6:3 Heb _Judah_, authored the epistle of Jude. [^d]: Mark 6:9 It was common for travelers to wear two tunics which could be switched. [^e]: Mark 6:11 A symbolic act expressing contempt for a place that had rejected the message of salvation. [^f]: Mark 6:15 Many of the Jews believed that the prophet Elijah would return before the Messiah appeared. [^g]: Mark 6:17 See note Matt 14:3. [^h]: Mark 6:21 Gr _chiliarchois_, originally referring to a commander of 1,000, but in Roman times of 600. [^i]: Mark 6:22 Salome was probably only fourteen or fifteen years old. [^j]: Mark 6:23 This was intended as an expression of generosity rather than a literal offer. In reality Herod was a tetrarch, a puppet ruler under Rome, and did not have authority over a “kingdom.” [^k]: Mark 6:37 One denarius was about a day’s wage.

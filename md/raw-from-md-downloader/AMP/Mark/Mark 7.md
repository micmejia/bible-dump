# Mark 7

***
















###### 1 







Now the Pharisees and some of the scribes came from Jerusalem and gathered around Him, 















###### 2 







and they had seen that some of His disciples ate their bread with [ceremonially] impure hands, that is, unwashed [and defiled according to Jewish religious ritual]. 















###### 3 







**(**[^a]For the Pharisees and all of the Jews do not eat unless they [^b]carefully wash their hands, holding firmly to the traditions of the elders; 















###### 4 







and _when they come_ from the market place, they do not eat unless they [^c]cleanse themselves [completely according to ritual]; and there are many other things [oral, man-made laws and traditions handed down to them] which they follow diligently, such as the washing of cups and pitchers and copper utensils.**)** 















###### 5 







So the Pharisees and scribes asked Jesus, "Why do Your disciples not live their lives according to the tradition of the elders, but [instead] eat their bread with [ceremonially] unwashed hands?" 















###### 6 







He replied, "Rightly did Isaiah prophesy about you hypocrites (play-actors, pretenders), as it is written [in Scripture], 'These people honor Me with their lips, But their heart is far from Me. 















###### 7 







'They worship Me in vain [their worship is meaningless and worthless, a pretense], Teaching the precepts of men as doctrines [giving their traditions equal weight with the Scriptures].' 















###### 8 







You disregard _and_ neglect the commandment of God, and cling [faithfully] to the tradition of men." 















###### 9 







He was also saying to them, "You are experts at setting aside _and_ nullifying the commandment of God in order to keep your [man-made] tradition _and_ regulations. 















###### 10 







For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother [with respect and gratitude]'; and, 'He who speaks evil of his father or mother must be put to death'; 















###### 11 







but you [Pharisees and scribes] say, 'If a man tells his father or mother, "Whatever I have that would help you is Corban, **(**that is to say, _already_ a gift to God**)**,"' 















###### 12 







then you no longer let him do anything for his father or mother [since helping them would violate his vow of Corban]; 















###### 13 







so you nullify the [authority of the] word of God [acting as if it did not apply] because of your tradition which you have handed down [through the elders]. And you do many things such as that." ## The Heart of Man 















###### 14 







After He called the people to Him again, He _began_ saying to them, "Listen [carefully] to Me, all of you, [hear] and understand [what I am saying]: 















###### 15 







there is nothing outside a man [such as food] which by going into him can defile him [morally or spiritually]; but the things which come out of [the heart of] a man are what defile _and_ dishonor him. 















###### 16 







[^d][If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear."] 















###### 17 







When Jesus had left the crowd and gone into the [^e]house, His disciples asked Him about the parable. 















###### 18 







And He said to them, "Are you, too, so foolish _and_ lacking in understanding? Do you not understand that whatever goes into the man from outside cannot defile _and_ dishonor him, 















###### 19 







since it does not enter his heart, but [only] his stomach, and [from there it] is eliminated?" **(**_By this, He_ declared all foods [^f]ceremonially clean.**)** 















###### 20 







And He said, "Whatever comes from [the heart of] a man, that is what defiles _and_ dishonors him. 















###### 21 







For from within, [that is] out the heart of men, come base _and_ malevolent thoughts _and_ schemes, acts of sexual immorality, thefts, murders, adulteries, 















###### 22 







acts of greed _and_ covetousness, wickedness, deceit, unrestrained conduct, envy _and_ jealousy, slander _and_ profanity, arrogance _and_ self-righteousness and foolishness (poor judgment). 















###### 23 







All these evil things [schemes and desires] come from within and defile _and_ dishonor the man." ## The Syrophoenician Woman 















###### 24 







Jesus got up and left there and went to the region of Tyre [and Sidon, the coastal area of Phoenicia]. He entered a house and did not want anyone to know _about it_; but it was impossible for Him to be hidden [from the public]. 















###### 25 







Instead, after hearing about Him, a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit immediately came and fell at His feet. 















###### 26 







Now the woman was a Gentile (Greek), a [^g]Syrophoenician by nationality. And she kept pleading with Him to drive the demon out of her daughter. 















###### 27 







He was saying to her, "First let the children [of Israel] be fed, for it is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the [^h]pet dogs (non-Jews)." 















###### 28 







But she replied, "Yes, Lord, but even the pet dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs." 















###### 29 







And He said to her, "Because of this answer [reflecting your humility and faith], go [knowing that your request is granted]; the demon has left your daughter [permanently]." 















###### 30 







And returning to her home, she found the child lying on the couch [relaxed and resting], the demon having gone. 















###### 31 







Soon after this Jesus left the region of Tyre, and passed through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, through the region of Decapolis [the ten Hellenistic cities]. 















###### 32 







They brought to Him a man who was deaf and had difficulty speaking, and they begged Jesus to place His hand on him. 















###### 33 







Jesus, taking him aside by himself, away from the crowd, put His fingers into the man's ears, and after spitting, He touched the man's tongue [with the saliva]; 















###### 34 







and looking up to heaven, He sighed deeply and said to the man, "Ephphatha," which [in Aramaic] means, "[^i]Be opened _and_ released!" 















###### 35 







And his ears were opened, his tongue was released, and he _began_ speaking plainly. 















###### 36 







Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone; but the more He ordered them, the more widely they continued to proclaim it. 















###### 37 







They were thoroughly astounded _and_ completely overwhelmed, saying, "He has done everything well! He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak!" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: Mark 7:3 Lit _with the fist_. This probably refers either to the method of washing the hands or, perhaps more likely, to the volume of water used. [^c]: Mark 7:4 The Greek word used is _baptize_, which in this context refers to an immersion ritual normally performed in a _miqveh_, a special bathtub large enough for the purpose and filled with water that was to be collected naturally. The _miqvehs_ typically were built into the ground outside where they could collect rain water. [^d]: Mark 7:16 Early mss do not contain this verse. [^e]: Mark 7:17 It was probably Peter’s house. [^f]: Mark 7:19 I.e. He abolished all prohibitions given in the Law against certain foods. [^g]: Mark 7:26 She came from an area north of Israel, between the Lebanon Mountains and the Mediterranean Sea. [^h]: Mark 7:27 Jews used _kuon (dog)_ as a derogatory term referring to Gentiles. This dog (_kuon_) was a despised, filthy, homeless street scavenger. When speaking with this woman, Jesus uses a word for “dog” (_kunarion_) that refers to a household pet. The use of the word _kunariois_ by both Jesus and the woman reflects the tenderness and spiritual depth of this exchange. More importantly, it foreshadows the fact that Gentile believers will not be spiritually homeless, but will also be welcomed into God’s household as His children. The gracious response of the woman recorded in v 28 confirms that on some level she understood this. [^i]: Mark 7:34 A command directed to the whole person.

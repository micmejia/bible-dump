# Mark 9

***
















###### 1 







And Jesus said to them, "I assure you _and_ most solemnly say to you, there are [^a]some of those who are standing here who will not taste (experience) death before they see the kingdom of God after it has come with power." 















###### 2 







Six days later, Jesus took with Him Peter and James and John, and led them up on a high mountain by themselves. And He was transfigured (changed in form) before them [and began to shine brightly with divine and regal glory]; 















###### 3 







and His clothes became radiant _and_ dazzling, intensely white, as no launderer on earth can whiten them. 















###### 4 







Elijah appeared to them along with Moses, and they were having a conversation with Jesus. 















###### 5 







Peter responded and said to Jesus, "Rabbi (Master), it is good for us to be here; let us make three [sacred] tents--one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah." 















###### 6 







For he did not [really] know what to say because they were terrified [and stunned by the miraculous sight]. 















###### 7 







Then a cloud formed, overshadowing them, and [^b]a voice came out of the cloud, "This is My beloved Son. Listen to Him _and_ obey Him!" 















###### 8 







Suddenly they looked around and no longer saw anyone with them, except Jesus alone. 















###### 9 







As they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus expressly ordered them not to tell anyone what they had seen, until the Son of Man had risen from the dead. 















###### 10 







So they [carefully and faithfully] kept the matter to themselves, [^c]discussing _and_ questioning [with one another] what it meant to rise from the dead. 















###### 11 







They asked Him, saying, "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first [before the Messiah comes]?" 















###### 12 







He answered them, "Elijah does come first and restores _and_ reestablishes all things. And yet how is it written of the Son of Man that He will suffer many things [grief and physical distress] and be treated with contempt [utterly despised and rejected]? 















###### 13 







But I say to you that Elijah has in fact come [already], and they [^d]did to him whatever they wished, just as it is written [in Scripture] of him." ## All Things Possible 















###### 14 







When they came [back] to the [other nine] disciples, they saw a large crowd around them, and scribes questioning _and_ arguing with them. 















###### 15 







Immediately, when the entire crowd saw Jesus, they were startled and _began_ running up to greet Him. 















###### 16 







He asked them, "What are you discussing with them?" 















###### 17 







One of the crowd replied to Him, "Teacher, I brought You my son, possessed with a spirit which makes him unable to speak; 















###### 18 







and whenever it seizes him [intending to do harm], it throws him down, and he foams [at the mouth], and grinds his teeth and becomes stiff. I told Your disciples to drive it out, and they could not do it." 















###### 19 







He replied, "O unbelieving (faithless) generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring him to Me!" 















###### 20 







They brought the boy to Him. When the [demonic] spirit saw Him, immediately it threw the boy into a convulsion, and falling to the ground he _began_ rolling around and foaming _at the mouth_. 















###### 21 







Jesus asked his father, "How long has this been happening to him?" And he answered, "Since childhood. 















###### 22 







The demon has often thrown him both into fire and into water, intending to kill him. But if You can do anything, take pity on us and help us!" 















###### 23 







Jesus said to him, "[You say to Me,] 'If You can?' All things are possible for the one who believes _and_ trusts [in Me]!" 















###### 24 







Immediately the father of the boy cried out [with a desperate, piercing cry], saying, "I do believe; help [me overcome] my unbelief." 















###### 25 







When Jesus saw that a crowd was rapidly gathering [around them], He rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, "You deaf and mute spirit, I command you, come out of him and never enter him again!" 















###### 26 







After screaming out and throwing him into a terrible convulsion, it came out. The boy looked so much like a corpse [so still and pale] that many [of the spectators] said, "He is dead!" 















###### 27 







But Jesus took him by the hand and raised him; and he stood up. 















###### 28 







When He had gone indoors, His disciples _began_ asking Him privately, "Why were we unable to drive it out?" 















###### 29 







He replied to them, "This kind [of unclean spirit] cannot come out by anything but prayer [to the Father]." ## Death and Resurrection Foretold 















###### 30 







They went on from there and _began_ to go through Galilee. Jesus did not want anyone to know it, 















###### 31 







because He was teaching His disciples [and preparing them for the future]. He told them, "The Son of Man is to be betrayed _and_ handed over to men [who are His enemies], and they will kill Him; and when He has been killed, He will rise [from the dead] three days later." 















###### 32 







But [^e]they did not understand this statement, and they were afraid to ask Him [what He meant]. 















###### 33 







They arrived at Capernaum; and when He was in the [^f]house, He asked them, "What were you discussing _and_ arguing about on the road?" 















###### 34 







But they kept quiet, because on the road they had discussed _and_ debated with one another which one [of them] was the greatest. 















###### 35 







Sitting down [to teach], He called the twelve [disciples] and said to them, "If anyone wants to be first, he must be last of all [in importance] and a servant of all." 















###### 36 







Taking a child, He set him before them; and taking him in His arms, He said to them, 















###### 37 







"Whoever receives _and_ welcomes one child such as this in My name receives Me; and whoever receives Me receives not [only] Me, but Him who sent Me." ## Dire Warnings 















###### 38 







John said to Him, "Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name, and we tried to stop him because he was not accompanying us [as Your disciple]." 















###### 39 







But Jesus said, "Do not stop him; for there is no one who will perform a miracle in My name, and be able soon afterward to speak evil of Me. 















###### 40 







For he who is not against us is for us. 















###### 41 







For whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because of your name as followers of Christ, I assure you _and_ most solemnly say to you, he will not lose his reward. 















###### 42 







"But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe _and_ trust in Me to stumble [that is, to sin or lose faith], it would be better for him if a heavy millstone [one requiring a donkey's strength to turn it] were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea. 















###### 43 







If your hand causes you to stumble _and_ sin, cut it off [that is, remove yourself from the source of temptation]! It is better for you to enter life crippled, than to have two hands and go into [^g]hell, into the unquenchable fire, 















###### 44 







[^h][where their worm does not die, and the fire is not put out.] 















###### 45 







If your foot causes you to stumble _and_ sin, cut it off [that is, remove yourself from the source of temptation]! It would be better for you to enter life lame than to have two feet and be thrown into hell, 















###### 46 







[^i][where their worm does not die, and the fire is not put out.] 















###### 47 







If your eye causes you to stumble _and_ sin, throw it out [that is, remove yourself from the source of temptation]! It would be better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye, than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell, 















###### 48 







where their worm [that feeds on the dead] does not die, and the fire is not put out. 















###### 49 







"For everyone will be salted with fire. 















###### 50 







Salt is good _and_ useful; but if salt has lost its saltiness (purpose), how will you make it salty? Have salt within yourselves _continually_, and be at peace with one another." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: Mark 9:7 See note Matt 3:17. [^c]: Mark 9:10 The doctrine of the resurrection was a well-known teaching of the Pharisees, so much so that Paul, an educated man, used it to turn the religious leaders against themselves (Acts 23:6-10). The three fishermen were, however, familiar with some of the prophetic Scriptures, but were confused by Jesusâ€™ statements regarding His death and resurrection. [^d]: Mark 9:13 This is a reference to Herodâ€™s imprisoning and beheading John the Baptist (6:17-28). [^e]: Mark 9:32 Cf v 10. [^f]: Mark 9:33 Probably Peterâ€™s home. [^g]: Mark 9:43 See note Matt 5:22. [^h]: Mark 9:44 Vv 44 and 46 are not found in early mss. [^i]: Mark 9:46 Vv 44 and 46 are not found in early mss.

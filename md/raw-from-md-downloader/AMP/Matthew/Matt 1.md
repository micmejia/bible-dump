Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: when His mother Mary had been [^j]betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child by [the power of] the Holy Spirit. 















###### 19 







And Joseph her [promised] husband, being a just _and_ righteous man and not wanting to expose her publicly to shame, planned to send her away _and_ divorce her quietly. 















###### 20 







But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, descendant of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the Child who has been [^k]conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. 















###### 21 







She will give birth to a Son, and you shall name Him Jesus (The LORD is salvation), for He will [^l]save His people from their sins." 















###### 22 







All this happened in order to fulfill what the Lord had spoken through the [^m]prophet [Isaiah]: 















###### 23 







"Behold, the [^n]virgin shall be with child and give birth to a Son, and they shall call His name Immanuel"--which, when translated, means, "God with us." 















###### 24 







Then Joseph awoke from his sleep and did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him, and he took _Mary_ [to his home] as his wife, 















###### 25 







but he kept her a virgin until she had given birth to a Son [her firstborn child]; and he named Him Jesus (The LORD is salvation). ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: Matthew 1:1 Gr _Christos_. Greek for _Messiah_, which means _Anointed One_. Throughout his gospel, which is directed primarily to Jewish believers, Matthew uses OT Scripture to emphasize the fact that Jesus is their promised Messiah. [^c]: Matthew 1:1 The shepherd boy who killed the Philistine giant Goliath, and later became king of Israel. [^d]: Matthew 1:2 Lit _begot, fathered_, from the Greek word _gennao_, meaning “to father a child” (early modern English _beget_) and so throughout the genealogy whenever _father_ occurs. [^e]: Matthew 1:2 Gr _Judas_; names of people in the OT are given in their OT form. [^f]: Matthew 1:5 The woman who assisted the Hebrew spies before the conquest of Jericho (Josh 2:1-21). [^g]: Matthew 1:6 David is the only one addressed as “the king.” The text places an emphasis on David, showing that Jesus is a descendant of David and an heir to the throne of David and the Davidic Covenant. [^h]: Matthew 1:6 Lit _her of Uriah_. [^i]: Matthew 1:16 The Greek singular feminine pronoun _hes_, translated “whom,” shows that Jesus was born of Mary alone, without Joseph’s participation; however, Jesus was considered Joseph’s legal son and heir. Accordingly, Matthew’s genealogy confirms Jesus as a legitimate descendant of David. [^j]: Matthew 1:18 The first stage of marriage (called _shiddukin_ in Hebrew) in Jewish tradition and law, usually lasting for a year before the wedding night; unlike an engagement, it was legally binding and required a divorce to nullify it. The woman remained with her parents during the betrothal year and was referred to as a “wife” even though the marriage was not consummated during this period of time (cf Deut 22:23, 24). [^k]: Matthew 1:20 Lit _begotten_. [^l]: Matthew 1:21 Those who, by personal faith, accept Him as Savior are saved from the penalty of sin and reconciled with the Father. [^m]: Matthew 1:22 The prophets in the Bible always have the ability to foretell the future as revealed to them by God. Scripture provides stringent criteria for testing a prophet’s ability to foretell future events (Deut 18:22). [^n]: Matthew 1:23 “Virgin” (Gr _parthenos_) clearly confirms that Mary was a virgin when she gave birth to Jesus.

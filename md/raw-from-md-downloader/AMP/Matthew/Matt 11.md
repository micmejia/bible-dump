# Matthew 11

***
















###### 1 







When Jesus had finished giving instructions to His twelve disciples, He went on from there to teach and to preach in their [Galilean] cities. 















###### 2 







Now when [^a]John [the Baptist] in prison heard about the activities of Christ, he sent _word_ by his disciples 















###### 3 







and asked Him, "Are You the Expected One (the Messiah), or should we look for someone else [who will be the promised One]?" 















###### 4 







Jesus answered, "Go and report to John what you hear and see: 















###### 5 







the blind receive [their] sight and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed [by healing] and the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have the gospel preached to them. 















###### 6 







And blessed [joyful, favored by God] is he who does not take offense at Me [accepting Me as the Messiah and trusting confidently in My message of salvation]." ## Jesus' Tribute to John 















###### 7 







As these men were going away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: "What did you go out in the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind [which is commonplace]? 















###### 8 







What did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft _clothing_ [entirely unsuited for the harsh desert]? Those who wear soft _clothing_ are in the palaces of kings! 















###### 9 







But what did you [really] go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and one [more eminent, more remarkable, and] [^b]far more than a prophet [who foretells the future]. 















###### 10 







This is the one of whom it is written [by the prophet Malachi], 'Behold, I send My messenger ahead of You, Who will prepare Your way before You.' 















###### 11 







I assure you _and_ most solemnly say to you, among those born of women there has not risen _anyone_ greater than John the Baptist; yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater [in privilege] than he. 















###### 12 







From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violent assault, and violent men seize it by force [as a precious prize]. 















###### 13 







For all the prophets and the Law prophesied up until John. 















###### 14 







And if you are willing to accept it, John himself is [the fulfillment of] Elijah [as the messenger] who was to come [before the kingdom]. 















###### 15 







He who has ears to hear, let him hear _and_ heed My words. 















###### 16 







"But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like little children sitting in the market places, who call to the others, 















###### 17 







and say 'We piped the flute for you [playing wedding], and you did not dance; we wailed sad dirges [playing funeral], and you did not mourn _and_ cry aloud.' 















###### 18 







For John came neither eating nor drinking [with others], and they say, 'He has a demon!' 















###### 19 







The Son of Man came eating and drinking [with others], and they say, 'Look! A glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners [including non-observant Jews]!' Yet wisdom is justified _and_ vindicated by her deeds [in the lives of those who respond to Me]." ## The Unrepenting Cities 















###### 20 







Then He began to denounce [the people in] the cities in which most of His miracles were done, because they did not repent [and change their hearts and lives]. 















###### 21 







"Woe (judgment is coming) to you, [^c]Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon [cities of the Gentiles], they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes [their hearts would have been changed and they would have expressed sorrow for their sin and rebellion against God]. 















###### 22 







Nevertheless I say to you, it will be more tolerable for [the pagan cities of] Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you. 















###### 23 







And you, Capernaum, are you to be exalted to heaven [for your apathy and unresponsiveness]? You will descend to Hades (the realm of the dead); for if the miracles done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. 















###### 24 







But I say to you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment, than for you." ## Come to Me 















###### 25 







At that time Jesus said, "I praise You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth [I openly and joyfully acknowledge Your great wisdom], that You have hidden these things [these spiritual truths] from the wise and intelligent and revealed them to infants [to new believers, to those seeking God's will and purpose]. 















###### 26 







Yes, Father, for this way was well-pleasing in Your sight. 















###### 27 







All things have been handed over to Me by My Father; and no one fully knows _and_ accurately understands the Son except the Father; and no one fully knows _and_ accurately understands the Father except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son [deliberately] wills to reveal _Him_. 















###### 28 







"Come to Me, all who are weary and heavily burdened [by religious rituals that provide no peace], and I will give you rest [refreshing your souls with salvation]. 















###### 29 







Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me [following Me as My disciple], for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest (renewal, blessed quiet) for your souls. 















###### 30 







For My yoke is easy [to bear] and My burden is light." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

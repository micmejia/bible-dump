# Matthew 13

***
















###### 1 







That same day Jesus went out of the house and was sitting beside the sea [of Galilee]. 















###### 2 







But such large crowds gathered around Him that He got into a boat and sat there [positioning Himself as a teacher], while the whole crowd stood on the shore. 















###### 3 







He told them many things in [^a]parables, saying, "Listen carefully: a sower went out to sow [seed in his field]; 















###### 4 







and as he sowed, some _seed_ fell beside the road [between the fields], and the birds came and ate it. 















###### 5 







Other seed fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil; and at once they sprang up because they had no depth of soil. 















###### 6 







But when the sun rose, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away. 















###### 7 







Other seed fell among thorns, and thorns came up and choked them out. 















###### 8 







Other seed fell on good soil and yielded grain, some a hundred times as much [as was sown], some sixty [times as much], and some thirty. 















###### 9 







He who has ears [to hear], let him hear _and_ heed My words." ## An Explanation 















###### 10 







Then the disciples came to Him and asked, "Why do You speak to the crowds in parables?" 















###### 11 







Jesus replied to them, "To you it has been granted to know the [^b]mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been granted. 















###### 12 







For whoever has [spiritual wisdom because he is receptive to God's word], to him _more_ will be given, and he will be richly _and_ abundantly supplied; but whoever does not have [spiritual wisdom because he has devalued God's word], even what he has will be taken away from him. 















###### 13 







This is the reason I speak to the crowds in parables: because while [having the power of] seeing they do not see, and while [having the power of] hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand _and_ grasp [spiritual things]. 















###### 14 







In them the prophecy of Isaiah is being fulfilled, which says, 'You will hear _and_ keep on hearing, but never understand; And you will look _and_ keep on looking, but never comprehend; 















###### 15 







For this nation's heart has grown hard, And with their ears they hardly hear, And they have [tightly] closed their eyes, Otherwise they would see with their eyes, And hear with their ears, And understand with their heart, and turn [to Me] And I would heal them [spiritually].' 















###### 16 







But blessed [spiritually aware, and favored by God] are your eyes, because they see; and your ears, because they hear. 















###### 17 







I assure you _and_ most solemnly say to you, many prophets and righteous men [who were honorable and in right standing with God] longed to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it. ## The Sower Explained 















###### 18 







"Listen then to the [meaning of the] parable of the sower: 















###### 19 







When anyone hears the word of the kingdom [regarding salvation] and does not understand _and_ grasp it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the one on whom seed was sown beside the road. 















###### 20 







The one on whom seed was sown on rocky ground, this is the one who hears the word and at once welcomes it with joy; 















###### 21 







yet he has no [substantial] root in himself, but is only temporary, and when pressure or persecution comes because of the word, immediately he stumbles _and_ falls away [abandoning the One who is the source of salvation]. 















###### 22 







And the one on whom seed was sown among thorns, this is the one who hears the word, but the worries _and_ distractions of the world and the deceitfulness [the superficial pleasures and delight] of riches choke the word, and it yields no fruit. 















###### 23 







And the one on whom seed was sown on the good soil, this is the one who hears the word and understands _and_ grasps it; he indeed bears fruit and yields, some a hundred times [as much as was sown], some sixty [times as much], and some thirty." ## Weeds among Wheat 















###### 24 







Jesus gave them another parable [to consider], saying, "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. 















###### 25 







But while his men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed [^c]weeds [resembling wheat] among the wheat, and went away. 















###### 26 







So when the plants sprouted and formed grain, the weeds appeared also. 















###### 27 







The servants of the owner came to him and said, 'Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? Then how does it have weeds in it?' 















###### 28 







He replied to them, 'An enemy has done this.' The servants asked him, 'Then do you want us to go and pull them out?' 















###### 29 







But he said, 'No; because as you pull out the weeds, you may uproot the wheat with them. 















###### 30 







Let them grow together until the harvest; and at harvest time I will tell the reapers, "First gather the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; but gather the wheat into my barn."'" ## The Mustard Seed 















###### 31 







He gave them another parable [to consider], saying, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field; 















###### 32 







and of all the seeds [planted in the region] it is the smallest, but when it has grown it is the largest of the garden herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air find shelter in its branches." ## The Leaven 















###### 33 







He told them another parable, "The kingdom of heaven is like [^d]leaven, which a woman took and worked into three [^e]measures of flour until all of it was leavened." 















###### 34 







All these things Jesus said to the crowds in parables, and He said nothing to them without [using] a parable. 















###### 35 







_This was_ to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet: "I will open My mouth in parables; I will utter things [unknown and unattainable] that have been hidden [from mankind] since the foundation of the world." ## The Weeds Explained 















###### 36 







Then He left the crowds and went into the house. And His disciples came to Him saying, "Explain [clearly] to us the parable of the weeds in the field." 















###### 37 







He answered, "The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man, 















###### 38 







and the field is the world; and [as for] the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the weeds are the sons of the evil _one_; 















###### 39 







and the enemy who sowed them is the devil, and the harvest is the end of the age; and the reapers are angels. 















###### 40 







So just as the weeds are gathered up and burned in the fire, so will it be at the end of the age. 















###### 41 







The Son of Man will send out His angels, and they will gather out of His kingdom all things that offend [those things by which people are led into sin], and all who practice evil [leading others into sin], 















###### 42 







and will throw them into the furnace of fire; in that place there will be weeping [over sorrow and pain] and grinding of teeth [over distress and anger]. 















###### 43 







Then the righteous [those who seek the will of God] will shine forth [radiating the new life] like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears [to hear], let him hear _and_ heed My words. ## Hidden Treasure 















###### 44 







"The kingdom of heaven is like a [very precious] treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid again; then in his joy he goes and sells all he has and buys that field [securing the treasure for himself]. ## A Costly Pearl 















###### 45 







"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls, 















###### 46 







and upon finding a single pearl of great value, he went and sold all that he had and bought it. ## A Dragnet 















###### 47 







"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet which was lowered into the sea, and gathered _fish_ of every kind, 















###### 48 







and when it was full, they dragged it up on the beach; and they sat down and sorted out the good _fish_ into baskets, but the worthless ones they threw away. 















###### 49 







So it will be at the end of the age; the angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous 















###### 50 







and throw the wicked into the furnace of fire; in that place there will be weeping [over sorrow and pain] and grinding of teeth [over distress and anger]. 















###### 51 







"Have you understood all these things [in the lessons of the parables]?" They said to Jesus, "Yes." 















###### 52 







He said to them, "Therefore every scribe who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like the head of a household, who brings out of his [^f]treasure things that are new _and_ fresh and things that are old _and_ familiar." ## Jesus Revisits Nazareth 















###### 53 







When Jesus had finished these parables, He left there. 















###### 54 







And after coming to [Nazareth] His hometown, He _began_ teaching them in their synagogue, and they were astonished, and said, "Where did this Man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers [what is the source of His authority]? 















###### 55 







Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not His mother called Mary? And are not His brothers, James and Joseph and Simon and Judas? 















###### 56 







And His sisters, are they not [living here] among us? Where then did this Man get all this [wisdom and power]?" 















###### 57 







And they took offense at Him [refusing to believe in Him]. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and in his own household." 















###### 58 







And He did not do many miracles there [in Nazareth] because of their unbelief. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

The Hebrew word (_seor_) refers specifically to the leavening agent (as opposed to dough containing it), which today is thought of as yeast, a type of fungi. In Jewish thinking, leaven was symbolic of impurity and corruption. Jesus used it as a symbol for the corrupt and hypocritical teachings of the Pharisees and Sadducees (see especially Luke 12:1; cf Matt 16:11; Mark 8:15), but He also used leaven’s ability to permeate a mass of dough many times its own size as an illustration of the spread of the kingdom of heaven as here and in Luke 13:21.

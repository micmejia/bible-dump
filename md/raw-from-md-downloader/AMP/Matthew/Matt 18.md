# Matthew 18

***
















###### 1 







At that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Who is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?" 















###### 2 







He called a little child and set him before them, 















###### 3 







and said, "I assure you _and_ most solemnly say to you, unless you repent [that is, change your inner self--your old way of thinking, live changed lives] and become like children [trusting, humble, and forgiving], you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. 















###### 4 







Therefore, whoever [^a]humbles himself like this child is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. 















###### 5 







Whoever receives _and_ welcomes one [^b]child like this in My name receives Me; 















###### 6 







but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble _and_ sin [by leading him away from My teaching], it would be better for him to have a heavy millstone [as large as one turned by a donkey] hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea. ## Stumbling Blocks 















###### 7 







"Woe (judgment is coming) to the world because of stumbling blocks _and_ temptations to sin! It is inevitable that stumbling blocks come; but woe to the person on whose account _or_ through whom the stumbling block comes! 















###### 8 







"If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble _and_ sin, cut it off and throw it away from you [that is, remove yourself from the source of temptation]; it is better for you to enter life crippled or lame, than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into everlasting fire. 















###### 9 







If your eye causes you to stumble _and_ sin, pluck it out and throw it away from you [that is, remove yourself from the source of temptation]; it is better for you to enter life with only one eye, than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fiery hell. 















###### 10 







"See that you do not despise _or_ think less of one of these little ones, for I say to you that their angels in heaven [are in the presence of and] continually look upon the face of My Father who is in heaven. 















###### 11 







[^c][For the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost.] ## Ninety-nine Plus One 















###### 12 







"What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them gets lost, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountain and go in search of the one that is lost? 















###### 13 







And if it turns out that he finds it, I assure you _and_ most solemnly say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that did not get lost. 















###### 14 







So it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones be lost. ## Discipline and Prayer 















###### 15 







"If your brother sins[^d], go and show him his fault in private; if he listens _and_ pays attention to you, you have won back your brother. 















###### 16 







But if he does not listen, take along with you one or two others, so that every word may be confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses. 















###### 17 







If he pays no attention to them [refusing to listen and obey], tell it to the [^e]church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile (unbeliever) and a tax collector. 















###### 18 







I assure you _and_ most solemnly say to you, whatever you bind [forbid, declare to be improper and unlawful] on earth [^f]shall have [already] been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose [permit, declare lawful] on earth [^g]shall have [already] been loosed in heaven. 















###### 19 







"Again I say to you, that if two [^h]believers on earth agree [that is, are of one mind, in harmony] about anything that they ask [within the will of God], it will be done for them by My Father in heaven. 















###### 20 







For where two or three are gathered in My name [meeting together as My followers], I am there among them." ## Forgiveness 















###### 21 







Then Peter came to Him and asked, "Lord, how many times will my brother sin against me and I forgive him _and_ let it go? Up to seven times?" 















###### 22 







Jesus answered him, "I say to you, not up to seven times, but seventy times seven. 















###### 23 







"Therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wished to settle accounts with his slaves. 















###### 24 







When he began the accounting, one who owed him 10,000 [^i]talents was brought to him. 















###### 25 







But because he could not repay, his master ordered him to be sold, with his wife and his children and everything that he possessed, and payment to be made. 















###### 26 







So the slave fell on his knees and begged him, saying, 'Have patience with me and I will repay you everything.' 















###### 27 







And his master's heart was moved with compassion and he released him and forgave him [canceling] the debt. 















###### 28 







But that same slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him [^j]a hundred denarii; and he seized him and _began_ choking him, saying, 'Pay what you owe!' 















###### 29 







So his fellow slave fell on his knees and begged him earnestly, 'Have patience with me and I will repay you.' 















###### 30 







But he was unwilling and he went and had him thrown in prison until he paid back the debt. 















###### 31 







When his fellow slaves saw what had happened, they were deeply grieved and they went and reported to their master [with clarity and in detail] everything that had taken place. 















###### 32 







Then his master called him and said to him, 'You wicked _and_ contemptible slave, I forgave all that [great] debt of yours because you begged me. 















###### 33 







Should you not have had mercy on your fellow slave [who owed you little by comparison], as I had mercy on you?' 















###### 34 







And in wrath his master turned him over to the torturers (jailers) until he paid all that he owed. 















###### 35 







My heavenly Father will also do the same to [every one of] you, if each of you does not forgive his brother from your heart." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

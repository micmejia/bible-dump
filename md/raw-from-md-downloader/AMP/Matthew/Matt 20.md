# Matthew 20

***
















###### 1 







"For the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of an estate who went out in the morning at dawn to hire workmen for his vineyard. 















###### 2 







When he had agreed with the laborers for a [^a]denarius for the day, he sent them into his vineyard. 















###### 3 







And he went out about the third hour (9:00 a.m.) and saw others standing idle in the market place; 















###### 4 







and he said to them, 'You also go into the vineyard, and I will pay you whatever is right (an appropriate wage).' And they went. 















###### 5 







He went out about the sixth hour (noon) and the ninth hour (3:00 p.m.), and did the same thing. 















###### 6 







And about the eleventh hour (5:00 p.m.) he went out and found others standing _around_, and he said to them, 'Why have you been standing here idle all day?' 















###### 7 







They answered him, 'Because no one hired us.' He told them, 'You go into the vineyard also.' 















###### 8 







"When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his manager, 'Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last [to be hired] and ending with the first [to be hired].' 















###### 9 







Those who had been _hired_ at the eleventh hour (5:00 p.m.) came and received a denarius each [a day's wage]. 















###### 10 







Now when the first [to be hired] came, they thought they would get more; but each of them also received a denarius. 















###### 11 







When they received it, they protested _and_ grumbled at the owner of the estate, 















###### 12 







saying, 'These men who came last worked [only] one hour, and yet you have made them equal [in wages] to us who have carried [most of] the burden and [worked in] the scorching heat of the day.' 















###### 13 







But the owner of the estate replied to one of them, 'Friend, I am doing you no injustice. Did you not agree with me for a denarius? 















###### 14 







Take what belongs to you and go, but I choose to give to this last man [hired] the same as I give to you. 















###### 15 







Am I not lawfully permitted to do what I choose with what is mine? Or is your eye [^b]envious because I am generous?' 















###### 16 







So those who are last [in this world] shall be first [in the world to come], and those who are first, last." ## Death, Resurrection Foretold 















###### 17 







As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, He took the twelve [disciples] aside, and along the way He said to them, 















###### 18 







"Listen carefully: we are going up to Jerusalem; and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and scribes (Sanhedrin, Jewish High Court), and they will [judicially] condemn Him _and_ sentence Him to death, 















###### 19 







and will hand Him over to the Gentiles (Roman authorities) to be mocked and scourged and crucified, and He will be raised [to life] on the third day." ## Preferred Treatment Asked 















###### 20 







Then [Salome] the [^c]mother of Zebedee's children [James and John] came up to Jesus with her sons and, kneeling down [in respect], asked a favor of Him. 















###### 21 







And He said to her, "What do you wish?" She answered Him, "Command that in Your kingdom these two sons of mine may sit [in positions of honor and authority] one on Your right and one on Your left." 















###### 22 







But Jesus replied, "You do not realize what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup [of suffering] that I am about to drink?" They answered, "We are able." 















###### 23 







He said to them, "You will drink My cup [of suffering]; but to sit on My right and on My left this is not Mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by My Father." 















###### 24 







And when the [other] ten heard this, they were resentful _and_ angry with the two brothers. 















###### 25 







But Jesus called them to Himself and said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles have absolute power _and_ lord it over them, and their great men exercise authority over them [tyrannizing them]. 















###### 26 







It is not this way among you, but whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant, 















###### 27 







and whoever wishes to be first among you shall be your [willing and humble] slave; 















###### 28 







just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for many [paying the price to set them free from the penalty of sin]." ## Sight for the Blind 















###### 29 







As they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed Him. 















###### 30 







And two blind men were sitting by the road, and when they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, "Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David (Messiah)!" 















###### 31 







The crowd sternly told them to be quiet, but they cried out all the more, "Lord, Son of David (Messiah) have mercy on us!" 















###### 32 







Jesus stopped and called them, and asked, "What do you want Me to do for you?" 















###### 33 







They answered Him, "Lord, _we want_ our eyes to be opened." 















###### 34 







Moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes; and immediately they regained their sight and followed Him [as His disciples]. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

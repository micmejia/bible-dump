# Matthew 23

***
















###### 1 







Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to His disciples, 















###### 2 







saying: "The scribes and Pharisees have seated themselves in Moses' chair [of authority as teachers of the Law]; 















###### 3 







so practice and observe everything they tell you, but do not do as they do; for they preach [things], but do not practice _them_. 















###### 4 







The scribes and Pharisees tie up [^a]heavy loads [that are hard to bear] and place them on men's shoulders, but they themselves will not lift a finger [to make them lighter]. 















###### 5 







They do all their deeds to be seen by men; for they make their [^b]phylacteries (tefillin) wide [to make them more conspicuous] and make their [^c]tassels long. 















###### 6 







They love the place of distinction _and_ honor at feasts and the best seats in the synagogues [those on the platform near the scrolls of the Law, facing the congregation], 















###### 7 







and to be greeted [with respect] in the market places _and_ public forums, and to have people call them Rabbi. 















###### 8 







But do not be called Rabbi (Teacher); for One is your Teacher, and you are all [equally] brothers. 















###### 9 







Do not call _anyone_ on earth [who guides you spiritually] your father; for One is your Father, He who is in heaven. 















###### 10 







Do not _let yourselves_ be called leaders _or_ teachers; for One is your Leader (Teacher), the Christ. 















###### 11 







But the greatest among you will be your servant. 















###### 12 







Whoever exalts himself shall be humbled; and whoever humbles himself shall be raised to honor. ## Eight Woes 















###### 13 







"But woe (judgment is coming) to you, [self-righteous] scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you shut off the kingdom of heaven in front of people; for you do not enter yourselves, nor do you allow those who are [in the process of] entering to do so. 















###### 14 







[^d][Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you swallow up widows' houses, and to cover it up you make long prayers; therefore you will receive the greater condemnation.] 















###### 15 







"Woe to you, [self-righteous] scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you travel over sea and land to make a single proselyte (convert to Judaism), and when he becomes a convert, you make him twice as much a son of hell as you are. 















###### 16 







"Woe to you, blind guides, who say, 'Whoever swears [an oath] by the sanctuary of the temple, that is nothing (non-binding); but whoever swears [an oath] by the gold of the temple is obligated [as a debtor to fulfill his vow and keep his promise].' 















###### 17 







You fools and blind men! Which is more important, the gold or the sanctuary of the temple that sanctified the gold? 















###### 18 







And [you scribes and Pharisees say], 'Whoever swears [an oath] by the altar, that is nothing (non-binding), but whoever swears [an oath] by the offering on it, he is obligated [as a debtor to fulfill his vow and keep his promise].' 















###### 19 







You [spiritually] blind men, which is more important, the offering, or the altar that sanctifies the offering? 















###### 20 







Therefore, whoever swears [an oath] by the altar, swears both by it and by everything [offered] on it. 















###### 21 







And whoever swears [an oath] by the sanctuary of the temple, swears by it and by Him who dwells within it. 















###### 22 







And whoever swears [an oath] by heaven, swears both by the throne of God and by Him who sits upon it. 















###### 23 







"Woe to you, [self-righteous] scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you give a tenth (tithe) of your mint and dill and cumin [focusing on minor matters], and have neglected the weightier [more important moral and spiritual] provisions of the Law: justice and mercy and faithfulness; but these are the [primary] things you ought to have done without neglecting the others. 















###### 24 







You [spiritually] blind guides, who strain out a gnat [consuming yourselves with miniscule matters] and swallow a camel [ignoring and violating God's precepts]! 















###### 25 







"Woe to you, [self-righteous] scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and of the plate, but inside they are full of extortion _and_ robbery and self-indulgence (unrestrained greed). 















###### 26 







You [spiritually] blind Pharisee, first clean the inside of the cup and of the plate [examine and change your inner self to conform to God's precepts], so that the outside [your public life and deeds] may be clean also. 















###### 27 







"Woe to you, [self-righteous] scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs which look beautiful on the outside, but inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean. 















###### 28 







So you, also, outwardly seem to be just _and_ upright to men, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness. 















###### 29 







"Woe to you, [self-righteous] scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build tombs for the prophets and decorate _and_ adorn the monuments of the righteous, 















###### 30 







and you say, 'If we had been _living_ in the days of our fathers, we would not have joined them in _shedding_ the blood of the prophets.' 















###### 31 







So you testify against yourselves that you are the descendants of those who murdered the prophets. 















###### 32 







Fill up, then, the [allotted] measure _of the guilt_ of your fathers' _sins_. 















###### 33 







You [^e]serpents, you spawn of vipers, how can you escape the penalty of hell? 















###### 34 







"Therefore, take notice, I am sending you prophets and wise men [interpreters, teachers] and scribes [men educated in the Mosaic Law and the writings of the prophets]; some of them you will kill and _even_ crucify, and some you will flog in your synagogues, and pursue _and_ persecute from city to city, 















###### 35 







so that on you will come _the guilt of_ all the blood of the righteous shed on earth, from the blood of righteous [^f]Abel to the blood of Zechariah [the priest], the son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar. 















###### 36 







I assure you _and_ most solemnly say to you, [the judgment for] all these things [these vile and murderous deeds] will come on this generation. ## Lament over Jerusalem 















###### 37 







"[^g]O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who murders the prophets and stones [to death] those [messengers] who are sent to her [by God]! How often I wanted to gather your children together [around Me], as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were unwilling. 















###### 38 







Listen carefully: your house is being left to you desolate [completely abandoned by God and destitute of His protection]! 















###### 39 







For I say to you, you will not see Me again [ministering to you publicly] until you say, 'Blessed [to be celebrated with praise] is He who comes in the name of the Lord!'" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

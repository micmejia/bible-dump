# Matthew 25

***
















###### 1 







"Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins, who took their lamps and went to [^a]meet the bridegroom. 















###### 2 







Five of them were foolish [thoughtless, silly, and careless], and five were wise [far-sighted, practical, and sensible]. 















###### 3 







For when the foolish took their lamps, they did not take any [extra] oil with them, 















###### 4 







but the wise took flasks of oil along with their lamps. 















###### 5 







Now while the bridegroom was delayed, they all began to nod off, and they fell asleep. 















###### 6 







But at midnight there was a shout, 'Look! The bridegroom [is coming]! Go out to meet _him_.' 















###### 7 







Then all those virgins got up and put their own lamps in order [trimmed the wicks and added oil and lit them]. 















###### 8 







But the foolish _virgins_ said to the wise, 'Give us some of your oil, because our lamps are going out.' 















###### 9 







But the wise replied, 'No, otherwise there will not be enough for us and for you, _too_; go instead to the dealers and buy _oil_ for yourselves.' 















###### 10 







But while they were going away to buy _oil_, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast; and the door was shut _and_ locked. 















###### 11 







Later the others also came, and said, 'Lord, Lord, open [the door] for us.' 















###### 12 







But He replied, 'I assure you _and_ most solemnly say to you, I do not know you [we have no relationship].' 















###### 13 







Therefore, be on the alert [be prepared and ready], for you do not know the day nor the hour [when the Son of Man will come]. ## Parable of the Talents 















###### 14 







"For it is just like a man who was _about_ to take a journey, and he called his servants together and entrusted them with his possessions. 















###### 15 







To one he gave five [^b]talents, to another, two, and to another, one, each according to his own ability; and then he went on his journey. 















###### 16 







The one who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them, and he [made a profit and] gained five more. 















###### 17 







Likewise the one who had two [made a profit and] gained two more. 















###### 18 







But the one who had received the one went and dug _a hole_ in the ground and hid his master's money. 















###### 19 







"Now after a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them. 















###### 20 







And the one who had received the five talents came and brought him five more, saying, 'Master, you entrusted to me five talents. See, I have [made a profit and] gained five more talents.' 















###### 21 







His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful _and_ trustworthy over a little, I will put you in charge of many things; share in the joy of your master.' 















###### 22 







"Also the one who had the two talents came forward, saying, 'Master, you entrusted two talents to me. See, I have [made a profit and] gained two more talents.' 















###### 23 







His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful _and_ trustworthy over a little, I will put you in charge of many things; share in the joy of your master.' 















###### 24 







"The one who had received one talent also came forward, saying, 'Master, I knew you to be a harsh _and_ demanding man, reaping [the harvest] where you did not sow and gathering where you did not scatter _seed_. 















###### 25 







So I was afraid [to lose the talent], and I went and hid your talent in the ground. See, you have what is your own.' 















###### 26 







"But his master answered him, 'You wicked, lazy servant, you knew that I reap [the harvest] where I did not sow and gather where I did not scatter _seed_. 















###### 27 







Then you ought to have put my money with the bankers, and at my return I would have received my _money_ back with interest. 















###### 28 







So take the talent away from him, and give it to the one who has the ten talents.' 















###### 29 







"For to everyone who has [and values his blessings and gifts from God, and has used them wisely], more will be given, and [he will be richly supplied so that] he will have an abundance; but from the one who does not have [because he has ignored or disregarded his blessings and gifts from God], even what he does have will be taken away. 















###### 30 







And throw out the worthless servant into the outer darkness; in that place [of grief and torment] there will be weeping [over sorrow and pain] and grinding of teeth [over distress and anger]. ## The Judgment 















###### 31 







"But when the Son of Man comes in His glory _and_ majesty and all the angels with Him, then He will sit on the throne of His glory. 















###### 32 







All the nations will be gathered before Him [for judgment]; and He will separate them from one another, as a shepherd separates his sheep from the goats; 















###### 33 







and He will put the sheep on His right [the place of honor], and the goats on His left [the place of rejection]. 















###### 34 







"Then the King will say to those on His right, 'Come, you blessed of My Father [you favored of God, appointed to eternal salvation], inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. 















###### 35 







For I was hungry, and you gave Me something to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave Me _something_ to drink; I was a stranger, and you invited Me in; 















###### 36 







_I was_ naked, and you clothed Me; I was sick, and you visited Me [with help and ministering care]; I was in prison, and you came to Me [ignoring personal danger].' 















###### 37 







Then the righteous will answer Him, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry, and feed You, or thirsty, and give You something to drink? 















###### 38 







And when did we see You as a stranger, and invite You in, or naked, and clothe You? 















###### 39 







And when did we see You sick, or in prison, and come to You?' 















###### 40 







The King will answer and say to them, 'I assure you _and_ most solemnly say to you, to the extent that you did it for one of these brothers of Mine, _even_ the least _of them_, you did it for Me.' 















###### 41 







"Then He will say to those on His left, 'Leave Me, you cursed ones, into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels (demons); 















###### 42 







for I was hungry, and you gave Me _nothing_ to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave Me nothing to drink; 















###### 43 







I was a stranger, and you did not invite Me in; naked, and you did not clothe Me; sick, and in prison, and you did not visit Me [with help and ministering care].' 















###### 44 







Then they also [in their turn] will answer, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry, or thirsty, or as a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to You?' 















###### 45 







Then He will reply to them, 'I assure you _and_ most solemnly say to you, to the extent that you did not do it for one of the least of these [my followers], you did not do it for Me.' 















###### 46 







Then these [unbelieving people] will go away into eternal (unending) punishment, but those who are righteous _and_ in right standing with God [will go, by His remarkable grace] into eternal (unending) life." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

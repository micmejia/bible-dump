# Matthew 27

***
















###### 1 







When it was morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people (Sanhedrin, Jewish High Court) conferred together against Jesus, [plotting how] to put Him to death [since under Roman rule they had no power to execute anyone]; 















###### 2 







so they bound Him, and led Him away and handed Him over to Pilate the governor [of Judea, who had the authority to condemn prisoners to death]. 















###### 3 







When Judas, His betrayer, saw that Jesus was condemned, he was gripped with remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders, 















###### 4 







saying, "I have sinned by betraying innocent blood." They replied, "What is that to us? See to that yourself!" 















###### 5 







And throwing the pieces of silver into the temple sanctuary, he left; and went away and [^a]hanged himself. 















###### 6 







The chief priests, picking up the pieces of silver, said, "It is not lawful to put these in the treasury [of the temple], because it is the price of blood." 















###### 7 







So after consultation they used the money to buy the Potter's Field as a burial place for strangers. 















###### 8 







Therefore that piece of ground has been called the Field of Blood to this day. 















###### 9 







Then the words spoken by Jeremiah the prophet were fulfilled: "And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of Him on whom a price had been set by the sons of Israel; 















###### 10 







and they gave them for the Potter's Field, as the Lord directed me." ## Jesus before Pilate 















###### 11 







Now Jesus stood before [Pilate] the governor, and the governor asked Him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" [In affirmation] Jesus said to him, "_It is as_ you say." 















###### 12 







But when the charges were brought against Him by the chief priests and elders, He did not answer. 















###### 13 







Then Pilate said to Him, "Do You not hear how many things they are testifying against You?" 















###### 14 







But Jesus did not reply to him, not even to a single accusation, so that the governor was greatly astonished. 















###### 15 







Now at the feast [of the Passover] the governor was in the habit of setting free any one prisoner whom the people chose. 















###### 16 







And at that time they were holding a notorious prisoner [guilty of insurrection and murder], called Barabbas. 















###### 17 







So when they had assembled [for this purpose], Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to set free for you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?" 















###### 18 







For Pilate knew that it was because of jealousy that the chief priests and elders had handed Jesus over to him. 















###### 19 







While he was seated on the judgment seat, his wife sent him _a message_, saying, "Have nothing to do with that righteous _and_ innocent Man; for last night I suffered greatly in a dream because of Him." 















###### 20 







But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to put Jesus to death. 















###### 21 







The governor said to them, "Which of the two do you wish me to set free for you?" And they said, "Barabbas." 















###### 22 







Pilate said to them, "Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?" They all replied, "Let Him be crucified!" 















###### 23 







And he said, "Why, what has He done that is evil?" But they continued shouting all the louder, "Let Him be crucified!" 















###### 24 







So when Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but rather that a riot was breaking out, he took water and washed his hands [to ceremonially cleanse himself of guilt] in the presence of the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of this [righteous] Man's blood; see _to that_ yourselves." 















###### 25 







And all the people answered, "Let [the responsibility for] His blood be on us and on our children!" 















###### 26 







So he set Barabbas free for them; but after having Jesus severely whipped (scourged), he handed Him over to be crucified. ## Jesus Is Mocked 















###### 27 







Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus into [^b]the Praetorium, and they gathered the whole Roman cohort around Him. 















###### 28 







They stripped him and put a scarlet [^c]robe on Him [as a king's robe]. 















###### 29 







And after twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on His head, and put a reed in His right hand [as a scepter]. Kneeling before Him, they ridiculed Him, saying, "Hail (rejoice), King of the Jews!" 















###### 30 







They spat on Him, and took the reed and struck Him _repeatedly_ on the head. 















###### 31 







After they finished ridiculing Him, they stripped Him of the _scarlet_ robe and put His own clothes on Him, and led Him away to crucify Him. 















###### 32 







Now as they were coming out, they found a man of [^d]Cyrene named [^e]Simon, whom they forced into service [^f]to carry the cross of Jesus. ## The Crucifixion 















###### 33 







And when they came to a place called Golgotha, which means [^g]Place of a Skull, 















###### 34 







they offered Him wine mixed with gall (myrrh, a bitter-tasting narcotic) to drink; but after tasting it, He refused to drink it. 















###### 35 







And when they had crucified Him, they divided His clothes among them by casting [^h]lots. 















###### 36 







Then sitting down there, they _began_ to keep watch over Him [to guard against any rescue attempt]. 















###### 37 







And above His head they put the accusation against Him which read, "[^i]THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS." 















###### 38 







At the same time two robbers were crucified with Jesus, one on the right and one on the left. 















###### 39 







Those who passed by were hurling abuse at Him _and_ jeering at Him, wagging their heads [in scorn and ridicule], 















###### 40 







and they said [tauntingly], "You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save Yourself [from death]! If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross." 















###### 41 







In the same way the chief priests also, along with the scribes and elders, mocked Him, saying, 















###### 42 







"He saved others [from death]; He cannot save Himself. He is the King of Israel; let Him now come down from the cross, and we will believe in Him _and_ acknowledge Him. 















###### 43 







He trusts in God; let God rescue _Him_ now, if He delights in Him; for He said, 'I am the Son of God.'" 















###### 44 







The robbers who had been crucified with Him also began to insult Him in the same way. 















###### 45 







Now from the sixth hour (noon) there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour (3:00 p.m.). 















###### 46 







About the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud [agonized] voice, [^j]"Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?" that is, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" 















###### 47 







When some of the bystanders there heard it, they _began_ saying, "This man is calling for [^k]Elijah." 















###### 48 







Immediately one of them ran, and took a sponge, soaked it with sour wine and put it on a reed, and gave Him a drink. 















###### 49 







But the rest said, "Let us see whether Elijah will come to save Him [from death]." 















###### 50 







And Jesus cried out again with a loud [agonized] voice, and gave up His spirit [voluntarily, sovereignly dismissing and releasing His spirit from His body in submission to His Father's plan]. 















###### 51 







And [at once] the veil [of the Holy of Holies] of the temple was [^l]torn in two from top to bottom; the earth shook and the rocks were split apart. 















###### 52 







The tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints (God's people) who had fallen asleep [in death] were raised [to life]; 















###### 53 







and coming out of the tombs after His resurrection, they entered the holy city (Jerusalem) and appeared to many people. 















###### 54 







Now the centurion, and those who were with him keeping guard over Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the things that were happening, they were terribly frightened _and_ filled with awe, and said, "Truly this was the Son of God!" 















###### 55 







There were also many women there looking on from a distance, who had accompanied Jesus from Galilee, ministering to Him. 















###### 56 







Among them was [^m]Mary Magdalene, and [^n]Mary the mother of [^o]James and Joseph, and [Salome] the [^p]mother of Zebedee's sons [James and John]. ## Jesus Is Buried 















###### 57 







When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who was also a disciple of Jesus. 















###### 58 







He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus [so that he might bury Him], and Pilate ordered that it be given _to him_. 















###### 59 







And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth (burial wrapping), 















###### 60 







and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut in the rock; and he rolled a large stone over the entrance of the tomb and went away. 















###### 61 







And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other [^q]Mary, sitting opposite the tomb. 















###### 62 







The next day, that is, _the day_ after the [day of] preparation [for the Sabbath], the chief priests and the Pharisees assembled before Pilate, 















###### 63 







and said, "Sir, we have remembered that when He was still alive that deceiver said, 'After three days I will rise [from the dead].' 















###### 64 







Therefore, give orders to have the tomb made secure _and_ safeguarded until the third day, otherwise His disciples may come and steal Him _away_ and tell the people, 'He has risen from the dead,' and the last deception [the reporting of His resurrection] will be worse than the first [the reporting that He is the Messiah]." 















###### 65 







Pilate said to them, "You have a guard [of soldiers]; go [with them], make the tomb as secure as you know how." 















###### 66 







So they went and [^r]made the tomb secure, and along with [stationing] a guard of soldiers [to be on watch] they set a seal on the stone. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

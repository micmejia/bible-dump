# Matthew 5

***
















###### 1 







When Jesus saw the crowds, He went up on the mountain; and when He was seated, His [^a]disciples came to Him. 















###### 2 







Then He _began_ to teach them, saying, 















###### 3 







"Blessed [spiritually prosperous, happy, to be admired] are the poor in spirit [those devoid of spiritual arrogance, those who regard themselves as insignificant], for theirs is the kingdom of heaven [both now and forever]. 















###### 4 







"Blessed [forgiven, refreshed by God's grace] are those who mourn [over their sins and repent], for they will be comforted [when the burden of sin is lifted]. 















###### 5 







"Blessed [inwardly peaceful, spiritually secure, worthy of respect] are the [^b]gentle [the kind-hearted, the sweet-spirited, the self-controlled], for they will inherit the earth. 















###### 6 







"Blessed [joyful, nourished by God's goodness] are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness [those who actively seek right standing with God], for they will be [completely] satisfied. 















###### 7 







"Blessed [content, sheltered by God's promises] are the merciful, for they will receive mercy. 















###### 8 







"Blessed [anticipating God's presence, spiritually mature] are the pure in heart [those with integrity, moral courage, and godly character], for they will see God. 















###### 9 







"Blessed [spiritually calm with life-joy in God's favor] are the makers _and_ maintainers of peace, for they will [express His character and] be called the sons of God. 















###### 10 







"Blessed [comforted by inner peace and God's love] are those who are persecuted for [^c]doing that which is morally right, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven [both now and forever]. 















###### 11 







"Blessed [morally courageous and spiritually alive with life-joy in God's goodness] are you when _people_ insult you and persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil things against you because of [your association with] Me. 















###### 12 







Be glad and exceedingly joyful, for your reward in heaven is great [absolutely inexhaustible]; for in this same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you. ## Disciples and the World 















###### 13 







"You are the [^d]salt of the earth; but if the salt has [^e]lost its taste (purpose), how can it be made salty? It is no longer good for anything, but to be thrown out and walked on by people [when the walkways are wet and slippery]. 















###### 14 







"You are the light of [Christ to] the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden; 















###### 15 







nor does _anyone_ light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house. 















###### 16 







Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good deeds _and_ moral excellence, and [recognize and honor and] glorify your Father who is in heaven. 















###### 17 







"Do not think that I came to do away with _or_ undo the [^f]Law [of Moses] or the [writings of the] Prophets; I did not come to destroy but to fulfill. 















###### 18 







For I assure you _and_ most solemnly say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke [of the pen] will pass from the Law until all things [which it foreshadows] are accomplished. 















###### 19 







So whoever breaks one of the least [important] of these commandments, and teaches others to do the same, will be called least [important] in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever practices and teaches them, he will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. 















###### 20 







"For I say to you that unless your righteousness (uprightness, moral essence) is more than that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. ## Personal Relationships 















###### 21 







"You have heard that it was said to the men of old, 'You shall not murder,' and 'Whoever murders shall be [^g]guilty before the court.' 















###### 22 







But I say to you that everyone who continues to be angry with his brother _or_ harbors malice against him shall be guilty before the court; and whoever speaks [contemptuously and insultingly] to his brother, [^h]'Raca (You empty-headed idiot)!' shall be guilty before the supreme court (Sanhedrin); and whoever says, 'You fool!' shall be in danger of the [^i]fiery hell. 















###### 23 







So if you are presenting your offering at the altar, and _while_ there you remember that your brother has something [such as a grievance or legitimate complaint] against you, 















###### 24 







leave your offering there at the altar and go. First make peace with your brother, and then come and present your offering. 















###### 25 







Come to terms quickly [at the earliest opportunity] with your opponent at law while you are with him on the way [to court], so that your opponent does not hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the guard, and you are thrown into prison. 















###### 26 







I assure you _and_ most solemnly say to you, you will not come out of there until you have paid the last [^j]cent. 















###### 27 







"You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery'; 















###### 28 







but I say to you that everyone who [so much as] looks at a woman with lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. 















###### 29 







If your right eye makes you stumble _and_ leads you to sin, tear it out and throw it away [that is, remove yourself from the source of temptation]; for it is better for you to lose one of the parts of your body, than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. 















###### 30 







If your right hand makes you stumble _and_ leads you to sin, cut it off and throw it away [that is, remove yourself from the source of temptation]; for it is better for you to lose one of the parts of your body than for your whole body to go into hell. 















###### 31 







"It has also been said, 'Whoever divorces his wife is to give her a certificate of divorce'; 















###### 32 







but I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except on grounds of sexual immorality, causes her to commit adultery; and whoever marries a woman who has been divorced commits adultery. 















###### 33 







"Again, you have heard that it was said to the men of old, 'You shall not make false vows, but you shall fulfill your vows to the Lord [as a religious duty].' 















###### 34 







But I say to you, do not make an oath at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God; 















###### 35 







or by the earth, for it is the footstool of His feet; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King. 















###### 36 







Nor shall you make an oath by your head, for you are not able to make a single hair white or black. 















###### 37 







But let your statement be, 'Yes, yes' or 'No, no' [a firm yes or no]; anything more than that comes from the evil one. 















###### 38 







"You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth [punishment that fits the offense].' 















###### 39 







But I say to you, do not resist an evil person [who insults you or violates your rights]; but whoever [^k]slaps you on the right cheek, turn the other toward him also [simply ignore insignificant insults or trivial losses and do not bother to retaliate--maintain your dignity, your self-respect, your poise]. 















###### 40 







If anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, [^l]let him have your coat also [for the Lord repays the offender]. 















###### 41 







And whoever [^m]forces you to go one mile, go with him two. 















###### 42 







Give to him who asks of you, and do not turn away from him who wants to borrow from you. 















###### 43 







"You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor (fellow man) and hate your enemy.' 















###### 44 







But I say to you, [^n]love [that is, unselfishly seek the best or higher good for] your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, 















###### 45 







so that you may [show yourselves to] be the children of your Father who is in heaven; for He makes His sun rise on those who are evil and on those who are good, and makes the rain fall on the righteous [those who are morally upright] and the unrighteous [the unrepentant, those who oppose Him]. 















###### 46 







For if you love [only] those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do that? 















###### 47 







And if you greet only your brothers [wishing them God's blessing and peace], what more [than others] are you doing? Do not even the Gentiles [who do not know the Lord] do that? 















###### 48 







You, therefore, will be perfect [growing into spiritual maturity both in mind and character, actively integrating godly values into your daily life], as your heavenly Father is perfect. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: Matthew 5:5 Or _humble, meek_. [^c]: Matthew 5:10 Lit _the sake of righteousness_. [^d]: Matthew 5:13 In ancient times salt was often used as a preservative. Similarly, followers of Christ are to preserve both the gospel message and Christian values in the secular world. [^e]: Matthew 5:13 The salt from the Dead Sea contains impurities that affect its qualities as a seasoning and as a preservative. [^f]: Matthew 5:17 I.e. the Pentateuch. [^g]: Matthew 5:21 Or _liable to_. [^h]: Matthew 5:22 A severe Aramaic insult. [^i]: Matthew 5:22 Gr _Gehenna_, a Greek version of the Hebrew for _Valley of Hinnom_, a ravine where garbage was burned continuously, located just south of Jerusalem. Often regarded in ancient times as symbolic of hell (the lake of fire), a realm reserved for the wicked. Mentioned in Matt 5:22, 29, 30; 10:28; 18:9; 23:15, 33; Mark 9:43, 45, 47; Luke 12:5; James 3:6. [^j]: Matthew 5:26 Gr _kodrantes_, from the Lat _quadrans_, which was the smallest Roman bronze coin. [^k]: Matthew 5:39 In this context the “slap” is not an act of violence, but more likely an insult or violation of one’s rights. [^l]: Matthew 5:40 Probably a prohibition against frivolous legal action. [^m]: Matthew 5:41 Roman soldiers were allowed to force civilian bystanders to carry their gear one mile for them. [^n]: Matthew 5:44 The key to understanding this and other statements about love is to know that this love (the Greek word _agape_) is not so much a matter of emotion as it is of doing things for the benefit of another person, that is, having an unselfish concern for another and a willingness to seek the best for another.

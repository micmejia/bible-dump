# Matthew 6

***
















###### 1 







"Be [very] careful not to do your [^a]good deeds publicly, to be seen by men; otherwise you will have no reward [prepared and awaiting you] with your Father who is in heaven. 















###### 2 







"So whenever you give to the poor _and_ do acts of kindness, do not blow a trumpet before you [to advertise it], as the hypocrites do [like actors acting out a role] in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may be honored _and_ recognized _and_ praised by men. I assure you _and_ most solemnly say to you, they [already] have their reward in full. 















###### 3 







But when you give to the poor _and_ do acts of kindness, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing [give in complete secrecy], 















###### 4 







so that your charitable acts will be done in secret; and your Father who sees [what is done] in secret will reward you. 















###### 5 







"Also, when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites; for they love to pray [publicly] standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the streets so that they may be seen by men. I assure you _and_ most solemnly say to you, they [already] have their reward in full. 















###### 6 







But when you pray, go into your most private room, close the door and pray to your Father who is in secret, and your Father who sees [what is done] in secret will reward you. 















###### 7 







"And when you pray, do not use meaningless repetition as the Gentiles do, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. 















###### 8 







So do not be like them [praying as they do]; for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him. 















###### 9 







"Pray, then, [^b]in this way: 'Our Father, who is in heaven, [^c]Hallowed be Your name. 















###### 10 







'[^d]Your kingdom come, Your [^e]will be done On earth as it is in heaven. 















###### 11 







'Give us this day our [^f]daily bread. 















###### 12 







'And forgive us our [^g]debts, as we have forgiven our debtors [letting go of both the wrong and the resentment]. 















###### 13 







'And do not [^h]lead us into temptation, but deliver us from [^i]evil. [^j][For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.]' 















###### 14 







For if you forgive [^k]others their trespasses [their reckless and willful sins], your heavenly Father will also forgive you. 















###### 15 







But if you do not forgive others [nurturing your hurt and anger with the result that it interferes with your relationship with God], then your Father will not forgive your trespasses. ## Fasting, The True Treasure, Wealth (Mammon) 















###### 16 







"And whenever you are fasting, do not look gloomy like the hypocrites, for they put on a sad and dismal face [like actors, discoloring their faces with ashes or dirt] so that their fasting may be seen by men. I assure you _and_ most solemnly say to you, they [already] have their reward in full. 















###### 17 







But when you fast, put oil on your head [as you normally would to groom your hair] and wash your face 















###### 18 







so that your fasting will not be noticed by people, but by your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees [what is done] in secret will reward you. 















###### 19 







"Do not store up for yourselves [material] treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. 















###### 20 







But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in and steal; 















###### 21 







for where your treasure is, there your heart [your wishes, your desires; that on which your life centers] will be also. 















###### 22 







"The eye is the lamp of the body; so if your eye is clear [spiritually perceptive], your whole body will be full of light [benefiting from God's precepts]. 















###### 23 







But if your eye is bad [spiritually blind], your whole body will be full of darkness [devoid of God's precepts]. So if the [very] light inside you [your inner self, your heart, your conscience] is darkness, how great _and_ terrible is that darkness! 















###### 24 







"No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon [money, possessions, fame, status, or whatever is valued more than the Lord]. ## The Cure for Anxiety 















###### 25 







"Therefore I tell you, stop being worried _or_ anxious (perpetually uneasy, distracted) about your life, as to what you will eat or what you will drink; nor about your body, as to what you will wear. Is life not more than food, and the body more than clothing? 















###### 26 







Look at the birds of the air; they neither sow [seed] nor reap [the harvest] nor gather [the crops] into barns, and yet your heavenly Father keeps feeding them. Are you not worth much more than they? 















###### 27 







And who of you by worrying can add one [^l]hour to [the length of] his life? 















###### 28 







And why are you worried about clothes? See how the lilies _and_ wildflowers of the field grow; they do not labor nor do they spin [wool to make clothing], 















###### 29 







yet I say to you that not even Solomon in all his glory _and_ splendor dressed himself like one of these. 















###### 30 







But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which is alive _and_ green today and tomorrow is [cut and] thrown [as fuel] into the furnace, _will He_ not much more _clothe_ you? You of little faith! 















###### 31 







Therefore do not worry _or_ be anxious (perpetually uneasy, distracted), saying, 'What are we going to eat?' or 'What are we going to drink?' or 'What are we going to wear?' 















###### 32 







For the [pagan] Gentiles eagerly seek all these things; [but do not worry,] for your heavenly Father knows that you need them. 















###### 33 







But first _and_ most importantly seek (aim at, strive after) His kingdom and His righteousness [His way of doing and being right--the attitude and character of God], and all these things will be given to you also. 















###### 34 







"So do not worry about tomorrow; for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

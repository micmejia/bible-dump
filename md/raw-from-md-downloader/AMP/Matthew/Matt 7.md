# Matthew 7

***
















###### 1 







"[^a]Do not judge _and_ criticize _and_ condemn [others unfairly with an attitude of self-righteous superiority as though assuming the office of a judge], so that you will not be judged [unfairly]. 















###### 2 







For just as you [hypocritically] judge others [when you are sinful and unrepentant], so will you be judged; and in accordance with your standard of measure [used to pass out judgment], judgment will be measured to you. 















###### 3 







Why do you look at the [insignificant] speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice _and_ acknowledge the [egregious] log that is in your own eye? 















###### 4 







Or how can you say to your brother, 'Let me get the speck out of your eye,' when there is a log in your own eye? 















###### 5 







You hypocrite (play-actor, pretender), first get the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye. 















###### 6 







"Do not give that which is holy to [^b]dogs, and do not throw your pearls before pigs, for they will trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces. ## Prayer and the Golden Rule 















###### 7 







"[^c]Ask _and_ keep on asking and it will be given to you; seek _and_ keep on seeking and you will find; knock _and_ keep on knocking and the door will be opened to you. 















###### 8 







For everyone who keeps on asking receives, and he who keeps on seeking finds, and to him who keeps on knocking, it will be opened. 















###### 9 







Or what man is there among you who, if his son asks for bread, will [instead] give him a stone? 















###### 10 







Or if he asks for a fish, will [instead] give him a snake? 















###### 11 







If you then, evil (sinful by nature) as you are, know how to give good _and_ advantageous gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven [perfect as He is] give what is good _and_ advantageous to those who keep on asking Him. 















###### 12 







"So then, in everything treat others the same way you want them to treat you, for this is [the essence of] the Law and the [writings of the] Prophets. ## The Narrow and Wide Gates 















###### 13 







"Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad _and_ easy to travel is the path that leads the way to destruction _and_ eternal loss, and there are many who enter through it. 















###### 14 







But small is the gate and narrow _and_ difficult to travel is the path that leads the way to [everlasting] life, and there are few who find it. ## A Tree and Its Fruit 















###### 15 







"Beware of the false prophets, [teachers] who come to you dressed as sheep [appearing gentle and innocent], but inwardly are ravenous wolves. 















###### 16 







By their fruit you will recognize them [that is, by their contrived doctrine and self-focus]. Do people pick grapes from thorn bushes or figs from thistles? 















###### 17 







Even so, every healthy tree bears good fruit, but the unhealthy tree bears bad fruit. 















###### 18 







A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. 















###### 19 







Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. 















###### 20 







Therefore, by their fruit you will recognize them [as false prophets]. 















###### 21 







"Not everyone who says to Me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of My Father who is in heaven. 















###### 22 







Many will say to Me on that day [when I judge them], 'Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, and driven out demons in Your name, and done many miracles in Your name?' 















###### 23 







And then I will declare to them publicly, 'I never knew you; depart from Me [you are banished from My presence], you who act wickedly [disregarding My commands].' ## The Two Foundations 















###### 24 







"So everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts on them, will be like a wise man [a far-sighted, practical, and sensible man] who built his house on the rock. 















###### 25 







And the rain fell, and the floods _and_ torrents came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock. 















###### 26 







And everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not do them, will be like a foolish (stupid) man who built his house on the sand. 















###### 27 







And the rain fell, and the floods _and_ torrents came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and it fell--and great _and_ complete was its fall." 















###### 28 







When Jesus had finished [speaking] these words [on the mountain], the crowds were astonished _and_ overwhelmed at His teaching; 















###### 29 







for He was teaching them as one who had authority [to teach entirely of His own volition], and not as their scribes [who relied on others to confirm their authority]. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

There are many judgments that are not only legitimate, but are commanded (cf John 7:24; 1 Cor 5:5, 12; Gal 1:8, 9; 1 John 4:1-3; 2 John 10); however, you cannot judge another if you are committing the same type of sin. [^b]: Matthew 7:6 In this verse “dogs” and “pigs” represent those who despise sacred things. [^c]: Matthew 7:7 Here the use of Greek present imperatives (asking, seeking, knocking; vv 7, 8) emphasizes persistent, constant prayer.

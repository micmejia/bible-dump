# Micah 3

***
















###### 1 







And I said, "Hear now, heads of Jacob And rulers of the house of Israel. Is it not for you to know _and_ administer justice? 















###### 2 







"You who hate good and love evil, Who tear the skin off my people And their flesh from their bones; 















###### 3 







You who eat the flesh of my people, Strip off their skin from them, Break their bones And chop them in pieces as for the pot, Like meat in a kettle." 















###### 4 







Then they will cry to the LORD, But He will not answer them; Instead, He will even hide His face from them at that time [withholding His mercy] Because they have practiced _and_ tolerated _and_ ignored evil acts. 















###### 5 







Thus says the LORD concerning the [false] prophets who lead my people astray; When they have _something good_ to bite with their teeth, They call out, "Peace," But against the one who gives them nothing to eat, They declare a holy war. 















###### 6 







Therefore _it will_ be night (tragedy) for you--without vision, And darkness (cataclysm) for you--without foresight. The sun shall go down on the [false] prophets, And the day shall become dark _and_ black over them. 















###### 7 







The seers shall be ashamed And the diviners discredited _and_ embarrassed; Indeed, they shall all cover their mouths [in shame] Because there is no answer from God. 















###### 8 







But in fact, I am filled with power, With the Spirit of the LORD, And with justice and might, To declare to Jacob his transgression And to Israel his sin. 















###### 9 







Now hear this, you heads of the house of Jacob And rulers of the house of Israel, Who hate _and_ reject justice And twist everything that is straight, 















###### 10 







Who build Zion with blood [and extortion and murder] And Jerusalem with violent injustice. 















###### 11 







Her leaders pronounce judgment for a bribe, Her priests teach for a fee, And her prophets foretell for money; Yet they lean on the LORD, saying, "Is not the LORD among us? No tragedy _or_ distress will come on us." 















###### 12 







Therefore, on account of you [^a]Zion shall be plowed like a field, Jerusalem shall become [^b]a heap of ruins, And the mountain of the house [of the LORD] _shall become_ like a densely wooded hill. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

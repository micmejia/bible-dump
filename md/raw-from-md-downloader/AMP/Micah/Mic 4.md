# Micah 4

***
















###### 1 







But it shall come about in the last days That the mountain of the house of the LORD Shall be established as the highest _and_ chief of the mountains; It shall be above the hills, And peoples shall flow [like a river] to it. 















###### 2 







And many nations shall come and say, "Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, To the house of the God of Jacob, That He may teach us about His ways And that we may walk in His paths." For the law shall go forward from Zion, And the word of the LORD [the revelation about Him and His truth] from Jerusalem. 















###### 3 







And He will judge between many peoples And render decisions for strong and distant nations. Then they shall hammer their swords into plowshares And their spears into pruning hooks [so that the implements of war may become the tools of agriculture]; Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, Nor shall they ever again train for war. 















###### 4 







Each of them shall sit [in security and peace] under his vine And under his fig tree, With no one to make them afraid, For the mouth of the [omnipotent] LORD of hosts has spoken it. 















###### 5 







For all the peoples [now] walk Each in the name of his god [in a transient relationship], As for us, we shall walk [securely] In the name of the LORD our [true] God forever and ever. 















###### 6 







"In that day," says the LORD, "I shall assemble the lame, And gather the outcasts [from foreign captivity], Even those whom I have caused pain. 















###### 7 







"I shall make the lame a [godly] remnant And the outcasts a strong nation; And the LORD shall reign over them in Mount Zion From this time on and forever. 















###### 8 







"As for you [Jerusalem], tower of the flock [of Israel], Hill _and_ stronghold of the Daughter of Zion (Jerusalem's inhabitants), To you the former dominion shall come, The kingdom of the Daughter of Jerusalem [when the Messiah reigns in Jerusalem, and the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled]. 















###### 9 







"Now, why do you cry out loudly? Is there no king among you? Has your counselor perished? For agony has gripped you like a woman in childbirth. 















###### 10 







"Writhe in pain and labor to give birth, O Daughter of Zion, Like a woman in childbirth; For now you shall go out of the city, Live in the field, And go to Babylon. There you will be rescued; There the LORD shall redeem you From the hand of your enemies. 















###### 11 







"Now many [conquering] nations are assembled against you, Who say, 'Let her be profaned [through Gentile presence and the temple's destruction], And let our eyes gaze on _and_ gloat over Zion.' 















###### 12 







"But they (Gentile nations) do not know the thoughts of the LORD, Nor do they understand His purpose _and_ plan; For He has gathered them (Gentiles) like sheaves to the threshing floor [for destruction]. 















###### 13 







"Arise and thresh, O Daughter of Zion! For I will make your horn iron And I will make your hoofs bronze; That you may beat many peoples in pieces [trampling down your enemies], That you may devote to the LORD their unjust gain (pagan possessions) And their wealth to the Lord of all the earth. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Micah 5

***
















###### 1 







"Now gather yourself in troops, O daughter of troops; A state of siege has been placed against us. They shall strike the ruler of Israel on the cheek with a rod (scepter). 















###### 2 







"But as for you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, Too little to be among the clans of Judah; From you One shall come forth for Me [who is] to be Ruler in Israel, His goings forth (appearances) are from long ago, From [^a]ancient days." 















###### 3 







Therefore, He will give them up until the time When she who is in labor has given birth to a child. Then what is left of His kinsmen Shall return to the children of Israel. 















###### 4 







And He shall stand and shepherd _and_ guide _His flock_ In the strength of the LORD, In the majesty of the name of the LORD His God; And they shall dwell [secure in undisturbed peace], Because at that time He shall be great [extending His authority] [Even] to the ends of the earth. 















###### 5 







This One [the Messiah] shall be our peace. When the Assyrian invades our land And tramples on our citadels _and_ in our palaces, Then shall we raise against him Seven shepherds and eight princes [an overpowering force] among men. 















###### 6 







They shall devastate the land of Assyria with the sword and The land of Nimrod within her [own] gates. And He (the Messiah) shall rescue us from the Assyrian (all enemy nations) When he attacks our land And when he tramples our territory. 















###### 7 







Then the remnant of Jacob Shall be among many peoples Like dew from the LORD, Like showers on the grass [a source of blessing] Which [come suddenly and] do not wait for man Nor delay for the sons of men. 















###### 8 







The remnant of Jacob Shall be among the nations, In the midst of many peoples Like a lion among the beasts of the forest, Like a young lion [suddenly appearing] among the flocks of sheep Which, if he passes through, Tramples down and tears into pieces [the nations in judgment], And there is no one to rescue. 















###### 9 







Your hand will be lifted up against your adversaries, And all your enemies shall be cut off _and_ destroyed. 















###### 10 







"And in that day," says the LORD, "I will cut off your horses from among you And destroy your chariots [on which you depend]. 















###### 11

###### 12 







"I will cut off witchcrafts _and_ sorceries from your hand, And you shall have no more fortune-tellers. 















###### 13 







"I will also cut off your carved images And your _sacred_ pillars from among you, So that you will no longer worship _and_ bow down To the work of your hands. 















###### 14 







"I will root out your Asherim (symbols of the goddess Asherah) from among you And destroy your cities [which are the centers of pagan worship].

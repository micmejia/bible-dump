# Micah 6

***
















###### 1 







Hear now what the LORD is saying, "Arise, plead your case before the mountains, And let the hills [as witnesses] hear your voice. 















###### 2 







"Hear, O mountains, the indictment of the LORD, And you enduring foundations of the earth, For the LORD has a case (a legal complaint) against His people, And He will dispute (challenge) Israel. 















###### 3 







"O My people, what have I done to you [since you have turned away from Me]? And how have I wearied you? Answer Me. 















###### 4 







"For I brought you up from the land of Egypt And ransomed you from the house of slavery, And I sent before you Moses [to lead you], Aaron [the high priest], and Miriam [the prophetess]. 















###### 5 







"My people, remember now What Balak king of Moab devised [with his evil plan against Israel] And what Balaam the son of Beor answered him [turning the curse into blessing for Israel], [Remember what the LORD did for you] from [^a]Shittim to Gilgal, So that you may know the righteous _and_ saving acts [displaying the power] of the LORD." ## What God Requires of Man 















###### 6 







With what shall I come before the LORD [to honor Him] And bow myself before God on high? Shall I come before Him with burnt offerings, With yearling calves? 















###### 7 







Will the LORD be delighted with thousands of rams, Or with ten thousand rivers of oil? Shall I present my firstborn for my acts of rebellion, The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? 















###### 8 







He has told you, O man, what is good; And what does the LORD require of you Except to be just, and to love [and to diligently practice] kindness (compassion), And to walk humbly with your God [setting aside any overblown sense of importance or self-righteousness]? 















###### 9 







The voice of the LORD shall call to the city [of Jerusalem]-- And it is sound wisdom to heed [solemnly] _and_ fear Your name [with awe-filled reverence]; "Hear, O tribe [the rod of punishment]. Who has appointed its time? 















###### 10 







"Are there not still treasures gained by wickedness In the house of the wicked, And a short (inaccurate) measure [for grain] _that is_ cursed? 















###### 11 







"Can I [be guiltless and] justify deceptive scales And a bag of dishonest weights? 















###### 12 







"For the rich men of the city are full of violence [of every kind]; Her inhabitants speak lies And their tongue is deceitful in their mouth. 















###### 13 







"So also I will make you sick, striking you down, Desolating _and_ devastating you, because of your sins. 















###### 14 







"You shall eat, but you will not be satisfied, And your [^b]emptiness shall be among you; You will [try to] remove [your goods and those you love] _for safekeeping_ But you will fail to save _anything_, And what you do save I shall give to the sword. 















###### 15 







"You shall sow but you shall not reap; You shall tread olives, but shall not anoint yourself with oil, And [you will extract juice from] the grapes, but you shall not drink the wine. 















###### 16 







"For [you have kept] the statutes of Omri [the idolatrous king], And all the works of the [wicked] house (dynasty) of Ahab; And you walk in their counsels _and_ policies. Therefore, I shall hand you over for destruction _and_ horror And your [city's] inhabitants for ridicule, And you shall bear the rebuke _and_ scorn of My people." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

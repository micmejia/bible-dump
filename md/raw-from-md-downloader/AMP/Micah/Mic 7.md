# Micah 7

***
















###### 1 







Woe is me (judgment is coming)! For I am Like one who gathers the summer fruits, like one who gleans the vintage grapes. There is not a cluster of grapes to eat, No first-ripe fig which my appetite craves. 















###### 2 







The godly person [who is faithful and loyal to God] has perished from the earth, And there is no upright _person_ [one with good character and moral integrity] among men. They all lie in wait to shed blood; Each hunts the other with a net. 















###### 3 







Concerning evil, both of their hands pursue it and do it diligently _and_ thoroughly; The prince asks, also the judge, for a bribe, And a great man speaks the [evil] desire of his soul. So they twist the course of justice between them. 















###### 4 







The best of them is [injurious] like a briar; The most upright is [prickly] like a thorn hedge. The day of your watchmen [that is, the time predicted by the prophets] And your punishment comes; Now shall be their confusion. 















###### 5 







Do not trust in a neighbor [because of the moral corruption in the land]; Do not have confidence in a friend. Guard the doors of your mouth From her who lies in your bosom. 















###### 6 







For the son dishonors the father _and_ treats him contemptuously, The daughter rises up [in hostility] against her mother, The daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law-- A man's enemies are the men (members) of his own household. ## God Is the Source of Salvation and Light 















###### 7 







But as for me, I will look expectantly for the LORD _and_ with confidence in Him I will keep watch; I will wait [with confident expectation] for the God of my salvation. My God will hear me. 















###### 8 







Do not rejoice over me [amid my tragedies], O my enemy! Though I fall, I will rise; Though I sit in the darkness [of distress], the LORD is a light for me. 















###### 9 







I will bear the indignation _and_ wrath of the LORD Because I have sinned against Him, Until He pleads my case and executes judgment for me. He will bring me out to the light, And I will behold His [amazing] righteousness _and_ His remarkable deliverance. 















###### 10 







Then my enemy [all the pagan nations] shall see it, And shame [for despising the LORD] will cover her who said to me, "Where is the LORD your God?" My eyes will look on her [with satisfaction at her judgment]; Now she (unbelievers) will be trampled down Like mud of the streets. 















###### 11 







_It shall be_ a day for building your walls, On that day the boundary [of Israel] shall be [greatly] extended. 















###### 12 







It _shall be_ a day when [^a]the Gentiles will come to you From Assyria and from the cities of Egypt, And from Egypt even to the river Euphrates, From sea to sea and from mountain to mountain. 















###### 13 







Yet the earth [beyond the land of Israel] shall become desolate because of those who dwell in it, Because of the fruit of their deeds. 















###### 14 







Shepherd _and_ rule Your people with Your scepter [of blessing], The flock of Your inheritance _and_ Your possession Which dwells alone [separate and secure from attack] in the forest, In the midst of a garden land. Let them feed in Bashan and Gilead As in the days of old [the days of Moses and Elijah]. 















###### 15 







"As in the days when you came out from the land of Egypt, I shall show you marvelous _and_ miraculous things." 















###### 16 







The [pagan] nations shall see [God's omnipotence in delivering Israel] and be ashamed Of all their might [which cannot be compared to His]. They shall put their hand on their mouth [in silent astonishment]; Their ears shall be deaf. 















###### 17 







They shall lick the dust like a serpent; Like crawling things of the earth They shall come trembling out of their fortresses _and_ hiding places. They shall turn _and_ come with fear _and_ dread to the LORD our God And they shall be afraid _and_ stand in awe before You [O LORD]. 















###### 18 







Who is a God like You, who forgives wickedness And passes over the rebellious acts of the remnant of His possession? He does not retain His anger forever, Because He [constantly] delights in mercy _and_ lovingkindness. 















###### 19 







He shall again have compassion on us; He will subdue _and_ tread underfoot our wickedness [destroying sin's power]. Yes, You will cast all our sins Into the depths of the sea. 















###### 20 







You shall give truth to Jacob And lovingkindness _and_ mercy to Abraham, As You have sworn to our forefathers From the days of old. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

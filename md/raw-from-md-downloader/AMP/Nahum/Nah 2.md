# Nahum 2

***
















###### 1 







[^a]The one who scatters has come up against you [Nineveh]. Man the fortress _and_ ramparts, watch the road; [^b]Strengthen your back [prepare for battle], summon all your strength. 















###### 2 







For the LORD will restore the splendor _and_ majesty of Jacob Like the splendor of [ancient and united] Israel, Even though destroyers have destroyed them And ruined their vine branches. 















###### 3 







The shields of his soldiers [of [^c]Media and Babylon] are colored red; The warriors are dressed in scarlet. The chariots blaze with fire of [flashing] steel When he is prepared _to march_, And the cypress _spears_ are brandished [for battle]. 















###### 4 







The chariots race madly in the streets; They rush wildly in the broad plazas. Their appearance is like torches; They rush in various directions like forked lightning. 















###### 5 







[^d]He remembers _and_ summons his nobles; They stumble in their march [terrified because of the attack]. They hurry to the city wall, And the [^e]mantelet is prepared _and_ firmly set up. 















###### 6 







The gates of the rivers [surrounding Nineveh] are opened And the palace [of sun-dried brick] is dissolved [by the torrents]. 















###### 7 







It is decreed: Nineveh is stripped, and she is carried away, And her handmaids are moaning like the sound of doves, Beating on their breasts [in sorrow]. 















###### 8 







Though Nineveh was like a pool of water throughout her days, Now her inhabitants are fleeing; "Stop! Stop!" [a few cry,] But no one turns back. 















###### 9 







Plunder the silver! Plunder the gold! For there is no end to the treasure-- Wealth from every precious object. 















###### 10 







She is emptied! She is desolate and waste! Hearts melting [in fear] and knees knocking! Anguish is in the whole body, And the faces of all grow pale! 















###### 11 







Where is the den of the lions (Assyria) And the feeding place of the young lions, Where the lion, lioness, and lion's cub prowled With nothing to fear? 















###### 12 







The lion [of Assyria] tore enough for his cubs (Assyrian citizens), Killed [enough prey] for his lionesses, And filled his lairs with prey And his dens with torn flesh. 















###### 13 







"Behold, I am against you [Nineveh]," declares the LORD of hosts, "and I will burn your chariots in the smoke, and the sword will devour your young lions. I will cut off your prey from the land, and the voice of your messengers will no longer be heard." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

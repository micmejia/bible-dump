# Nahum 3

***
















###### 1 







Woe (judgment is coming) to the city of blood [guilty of murder and mayhem], completely full of lies and pillage; Her prey never departs [alive]. 















###### 2 







The noise of the [cracking of the] whip, The noise of the rattling of the wheel, Galloping horses And rumbling _and_ bounding chariots [in the assault of Nineveh]! 















###### 3 







Horsemen charging, Swords flashing, spears gleaming, Many slain, a mass of corpses, No end of corpses-- The horsemen stumble over the corpses! 















###### 4 







All because of the many acts of prostitution of [Nineveh] the prostitute, The charming _and_ well-favored one, the mistress of sorceries, Who betrays nations by her acts of prostitution (idolatry) And families by her sorceries. 















###### 5 







"Behold, I am against you," declares the LORD of hosts, "And I will lift up your skirts over your face, And I will let the nations look at your nakedness [O Nineveh] And the kingdoms at your disgrace. 















###### 6 







"I will throw filth on you And make you vile _and_ treat you with contempt, And set you up as a spectacle. 















###### 7 







"And it will come about that all who see you Will shrink back _and_ run from you and say, 'Nineveh is completely ruined! Who will grieve for her?' Where will I seek comforters for you?" 















###### 8 







Are you better than [^a]Thebes, Which was situated by the waters of the Nile, With water surrounding her, Whose defense was the sea (the Nile), Whose wall _consisted_ of the sea? 















###### 9 







Ethiopia was her strength, And Egypt too, without limits. [^b]Put and Lubim were among her helpers. 















###### 10 







Yet she became an exile; She went into captivity. Her young children were dashed to pieces At the head of every street; They cast lots for her honorable men, And all her great men were bound with chains. 















###### 11 







You too [Nineveh] will become drunk [with the cup of God's wrath]; You will be hidden. You too [Nineveh] will search [in vain] for a refuge from the enemy. 















###### 12 







All your fortresses are [nothing but] fig trees with ripe figs-- When shaken they fall into the mouth of the eater. 















###### 13 







Behold, your people are [as weak and helpless as] women in your midst! The gates of your land are opened wide to your enemies; Fire consumes the bars across your gates. 















###### 14 







Draw water for a [long, continued] siege! Strengthen your fortresses! Go down to the clay pits, trample the mortar! Prepare the brick kiln [to burn bricks for the rampart]! 















###### 15 







But there [in the very midst of these preparations] the fire will devour you; The sword will cut you down; It will devour you as the locust does. Multiply yourself like the creeping locusts; Multiply yourself like the swarming locusts. 















###### 16 







You have increased your traders more than the [visible] stars of heaven-- The creeping locust strips _and_ destroys and then flies away. 















###### 17 







Your guardsmen are like the swarming locusts. Your marshals are like the hordes of grasshoppers Settling in the stone walls on a cold day. When the sun rises, they fly away, And no one knows the place where they are. 















###### 18 







Your shepherds are asleep, O king of Assyria; Your nobles are lying down [in death]. Your people are scattered on the mountains And there is no one to gather them. 















###### 19 







There is no relief _and_ healing for your hurt; Your wound is incurable. All who hear the news about you Clap their hands over [what has happened to] you. For on whom has your [unceasing] evil not come continually? ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

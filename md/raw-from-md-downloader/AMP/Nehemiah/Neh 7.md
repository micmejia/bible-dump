# Nehemiah 7

***
















###### 1 







Now when the wall had been rebuilt and I had set up the doors, and the gatekeepers, singers, and Levites had been appointed, 















###### 2 







I put my brother Hanani, with Hananiah the commander of the fortress, in charge of Jerusalem, for Hananiah was a more faithful and God-fearing man than many [of the others]. 















###### 3 







I said to them, "Do not let the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the [^a]sun is hot; and while the watchmen are still standing _guard_, have them shut and bar the doors. Appoint guards from the residents of Jerusalem, each at his post [on the wall], and each in front of his own house." 















###### 4 







Now the city was spacious and large, but there were few people in it and the houses had not [yet] been built. 















###### 5

# Numbers 12

***
















###### 1 







Now [^a]Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the [^b]Cushite woman whom he had married **(**for he had married a Cushite woman**)**; 















###### 2 







and they said, "Has the LORD really spoken only through Moses? Has He not spoken also through us?" And the LORD heard it. 















###### 3 







**(**[^c]Now the man Moses was very humble (gentle, kind, devoid of self-righteousness), more than any man who was on the face of the earth.**)** 















###### 4 







Suddenly the LORD said to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, "Come out, you three, to the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle)." And the three of them came out. 















###### 5 







The LORD came down in a pillar of cloud and stood at the doorway of the tabernacle, and He called Aaron and Miriam, and they came forward. 















###### 6 







And He said, "Hear now My words: If there is a prophet among you, I the LORD will make Myself known to him in a vision And I will speak to him in a dream. 















###### 7 







"But it is not so with My servant Moses; He is entrusted _and_ faithful in all My house. 















###### 8 







"With him I speak mouth to mouth [directly], Clearly _and_ openly and not in riddles; And he beholds the form of the LORD. Why then were you not afraid to speak against My servant Moses?" 















###### 9 







And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Miriam and Aaron, and He departed. 















###### 10 







But when the cloud had withdrawn from over the tent, behold, Miriam was leprous, as _white as_ snow. And Aaron turned _and_ looked at Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous. 















###### 11 







Then Aaron said to Moses, "Oh, my lord, I plead with you, do not account this sin to us, in which we have acted foolishly and in which we have sinned. 















###### 12 







Oh, do not let her be like one dead, already half decomposed when he comes from his mother's womb." 















###### 13 







So Moses cried out to the LORD, saying, "Heal her please, O God, I plead with You!" 















###### 14 







But the LORD said to Moses, "If her father had but [^d]spit in her face, would she not bear her shame for seven days? Let her be shut up outside the camp for seven days, and afterward she may return." 















###### 15 







So Miriam was shut up outside the camp for seven days, and the people did not move on until Miriam was brought in again [and declared ceremonially clean from her leprosy]. 















###### 16 







Afterward the people moved on from Hazeroth and camped in the Wilderness of Paran. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: Numbers 12:1 Because the ancient borders of Cush and Midian sometimes overlapped Miriam may have considered Moses’ wife, Zipporah, a Cushite instead of a Midianite (Ex 2:21); however, it is also possible that Zipporah had died and this refers to a second wife. Marriage with a Canaanite was forbidden (Ex 34:11, 16), but not marriage with an Egyptian or Cushite. Joseph’s wife was an Egyptian (Gen 41:45). [^c]: Numbers 12:3 Some scholars believe this comment was added to the text after Moses’ death. [^d]: Numbers 12:14 I.e. rebuked her publicly.

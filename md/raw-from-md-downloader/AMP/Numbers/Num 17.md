# Numbers 17

***
















###### 1 







Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 















###### 2 







"Speak to the sons of Israel and get rods from them, a rod for each father's household, from all their leaders according to their fathers' households, twelve rods. Write every man's name on his rod, 















###### 3 







and write Aaron's name on the rod of Levi [his ancestor]; for there is one rod for the head of each of their fathers' households. 















###### 4 







You shall then deposit them in the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle) in front of [the ark of] the Testimony, where I meet with you. 















###### 5 







It shall be that the rod of the man whom I choose will bud, and I will no longer hear the constant grumblings of the Israelites, who are grumbling against you." 















###### 6 







So Moses spoke to the Israelites, and each of their leaders gave him a rod, one for each leader according to their fathers' households, twelve rods, and the rod of Aaron was among their rods. 















###### 7 







So Moses deposited the rods before the LORD in the Tent of the Testimony (tabernacle). 















###### 8 







Now on the next day Moses went into the Tent of the Testimony, and [^a]the rod of Aaron of the tribe of Levi had sprouted and put out buds and produced blossoms and yielded [ripe] almonds. 















###### 9 







Moses brought out all the rods from the presence of LORD to all the Israelites; and they looked, and each man took his rod. 















###### 10 







But the LORD said to Moses, "Put Aaron's rod back before the Testimony [in the ark], to be kept as a [warning] sign for the rebellious _and_ contentious, so that you may put an end to their murmurings [of discontent] against Me, so that they do not die." 















###### 11 







And Moses did so; just as the LORD had commanded him, so he did. 















###### 12 







The sons of Israel said to Moses, "Look, we perish, we are doomed, all doomed! 















###### 13 







Everyone who approaches, who approaches the tabernacle of the LORD, must die. Are we to perish completely?" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

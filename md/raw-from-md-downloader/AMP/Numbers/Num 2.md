The tribes were organized into groups of three. The leading tribe in each triad had a standard representing their group. [^b]: Numbers 2:3 The standard of the tribes of Judah contained the picture of a lion. [^c]: Numbers 2:10 The standard of the tribes headed by Reuben contained the picture of a man. [^d]: Numbers 2:18 The standard of the tribes headed by Ephraim contained the picture of an ox. [^e]: Numbers 2:25 The standard of the tribes headed by Dan contained the picture of an eagle. [^f]: Numbers 2:31 The symbol on the various tribal standards seems important in view of the cherubim of Ezek 1:10, and in view of the living creatures of Rev 4:7. God was present in each of these settings.

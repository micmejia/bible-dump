# Numbers 23

***
















###### 1 







Then Balaam said to Balak, "Build seven altars for me here, and prepare for me seven bulls and seven rams here." 















###### 2 







Balak did just as Balaam had said, and Balak and Balaam offered a bull and a ram on each altar. 















###### 3 







Then Balaam said to Balak, "Stand beside your burnt offering and I will go. Perhaps the LORD will come to meet me; and whatever He shows me I will tell you." So he went to a desolate hill. 















###### 4 







Now God met Balaam, who said to Him, "I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered a bull and a ram on each altar." 















###### 5 







Then the LORD put a speech in Balaam's mouth, and said, "Return to Balak, and you shall speak thus." 















###### 6 







Balaam returned to Balak, and behold, he was standing by his burnt sacrifice, he and all the leaders of Moab. 















###### 7 







Balaam took up his [first] discourse (oracle) and said: "Balak, the king of Moab, has brought me from Aram (Syria), from the mountains of the east, [saying,] 'Come, curse [the descendants of] Jacob for me; And come, [violently] denounce Israel.' 















###### 8 







"How shall I curse those whom God has not cursed? Or how can I [violently] denounce those the LORD has not denounced? 















###### 9 







"For from the top of the rocks I see Israel, And from the hills I look at him. Behold, the people [of Israel] shall dwell alone And will not be reckoned among the nations. 















###### 10 







"Who can count the dust (the descendants) of Jacob And the number of _even_ the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous [those who are upright and in right standing with God], And let my end be like his!" 















###### 11 







Then Balak said to Balaam, "What have you done to me? I brought you to curse my enemies, but here you have [thoroughly] blessed them instead!" 















###### 12 







Balaam answered, "Must I not be obedient _and_ careful to speak what the LORD has put in my mouth?" 















###### 13 







Balak said to him, "Come with me, I implore you, to another place from where you can see them, although you will see only the nearest and not all of them; and curse them for me from there." 















###### 14 







So he took Balaam to the field of Zophim to the top of [Mount] Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar. 















###### 15 







Balaam said to Balak, "Stand here beside your burnt offering while I go to meet the LORD over there." 















###### 16 







Then the LORD met Balaam and put a speech in his mouth, and said, "Go back to Balak and you shall speak thus." 















###### 17 







When Balaam returned to Balak, he was standing beside his burnt offering, and the leaders of Moab were with him. And Balak said to him, "What has the LORD spoken?" 















###### 18 







Balaam took up his [second] discourse (oracle) and said: "Rise up, O Balak, and hear; Listen [closely] to me, son of Zippor. 















###### 19 







"God is not a man, that He should lie, Nor a son of man, that He should repent. Has He said, and will He not do it? Or has He spoken and will He not make it good _and_ fulfill it? 















###### 20 







"Behold, I have received _His command_ to bless [Israel]. He has blessed, and I cannot reverse it. 















###### 21 







"God has not observed wickedness in Jacob [for he is forgiven], Nor has He seen trouble in Israel. The LORD their God is with Israel, And the shout of their King is among the people. 















###### 22 







"God brought them out of Egypt; They have the strength of a wild ox. 















###### 23 







"For there is no enchantment _or_ omen against Jacob, Nor is there any divination against Israel. At the proper time it shall be said to Jacob And to Israel, what has God done! 















###### 24 







"Behold, a people rises up like a lioness And lifts itself up like a lion; He will not lie down until he devours the prey And drinks the blood of the slain." 















###### 25 







Then Balak said to Balaam, "Neither curse them at all nor bless them at all!" 















###### 26 







But Balaam answered Balak, "Did I not say to you, 'All that the LORD speaks, that I must do?'" 















###### 27 







Then Balak said to Balaam, "Please come; I will take you to another place. Perhaps it will please God to let you curse them for me from there." 















###### 28 







So Balak brought Balaam to the top of [Mount] Peor, that overlooks the wasteland. 















###### 29 







And Balaam said to Balak, "Build seven altars for me here, and prepare for me seven bulls and seven rams here." 















###### 30 







Balak did just as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

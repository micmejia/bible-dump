# Numbers 24

***
















###### 1 







When Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he did not go as he had done each time before [superstitiously] to seek omens _and_ signs [in the natural world], but he set his face toward the wilderness (desert). 















###### 2 







And Balaam raised his eyes and he saw Israel living _in their tents_ tribe by tribe; and the Spirit of God came on him. 















###### 3 







He took up his [third] discourse (oracle) and said: "The oracle of Balaam the son of Beor, And the oracle of the man whose eye is opened [at last, to see clearly the purpose and will of God], 















###### 4 







The oracle of one who hears the words of God, Who sees the vision of the Almighty, Falling down, but having his eyes open _and_ uncovered, 















###### 5 







How fair are your tents, O Jacob, And your tabernacles, O Israel! 















###### 6 







"Like valleys that stretch out, Like gardens beside the river, Like aloes planted by the LORD, Like cedars beside the waters. 















###### 7 







"Water [that is, great blessings] will flow from his buckets, And his offspring _will live_ by many waters, And his king will be higher than [^a]Agag, And his kingdom shall be exalted. 















###### 8 







"God brought Israel out of Egypt; Israel has [^b]strength like the wild ox; He will devour [Gentile] nations, his adversaries (enemies), And will crush their bones in pieces, And shatter them with his arrows. 















###### 9 







"He bowed down [to rest], he lies down as a lion; And as a lioness, who dares to rouse him? Blessed [of God] is he who blesses you, And cursed [of God] is he who curses you." 















###### 10 







Then Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he struck his hands together; and Balak said to Balaam, "I called you to curse my enemies, but behold, you have done nothing but bless them these three times. 















###### 11 







Therefore now flee to your place! I had intended to honor you greatly, but behold, the LORD has held you back from honor." 















###### 12 







Balaam said to Balak, "Did I not tell your messengers whom you had sent to me, 















###### 13 







'Even if Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the command of the LORD, to do either good or bad of my own accord. What the LORD speaks, that I will speak?' 















###### 14 







And now, look, I am going to my people; come, I will advise you as to what this people [Israel] will do to your people [Moab] in the days to come." 















###### 15 







He took up his [fourth] discourse (oracle) and said: "The oracle of Balaam the son of Beor, The oracle of the man whose eye is opened, 















###### 16 







The oracle of him who hears the words of God And knows the knowledge of the [^c]Most High, Who sees the vision of the [^d]Almighty, Falling down, but having his eyes open _and_ uncovered: 















###### 17 







"I see Him, but not now; I behold Him, but not near. A star shall come forth from [the descendants of] Jacob, A scepter shall rise out of [the descendants of] Israel And shall crush the forehead of Moab And destroy all the sons of Sheth. 















###### 18 







"Edom shall be [taken as] a possession, [Mount] Seir, Israel's enemies, also will be a possession, While Israel performs valiantly. 















###### 19 







"One from [the descendants of] Jacob shall have dominion And will destroy the remnant from the city." 















###### 20 







Balaam looked at Amalek and took up his [fifth] discourse (oracle) and said: "Amalek was the first of the [neighboring] nations [to oppose the Israelites after they left Egypt], But his end shall be [^e]destruction." 















###### 21 







And Balaam looked at the Kenites and took up his [sixth] discourse (oracle) and said: "Strong is your dwelling place, And you set your nest in the cliff. 















###### 22 







"Nevertheless the Kenites will be consumed. How long will Asshur (Assyria) keep you (Israel) captive?" 















###### 23 







Then he took up his [seventh] discourse (oracle) and said: "Alas, who can live unless God has ordained it? 















###### 24 







"But ships _shall come_ from the coast of [^f]Kittim, And shall afflict Asshur (Assyria) and [^g]Eber; So they (the victors) also _will come_ to destruction." 















###### 25 







Then Balaam arose and departed and returned to his place, and Balak also went on his way. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

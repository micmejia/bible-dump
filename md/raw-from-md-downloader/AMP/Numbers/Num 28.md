***
















###### 1 







Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 















###### 2 







"Command the Israelites and say to them, 'You shall be careful to present at its appointed time [during the year] My offering, My food for My offerings by fire as a sweet _and_ soothing aroma to Me.' 















###### 3 







You shall say to the people, 'This is the offering by fire which you shall present to the LORD every day: two male lambs one year old without blemish as a continual burnt offering. 















###### 4 







You shall offer one lamb in the morning and you shall offer the other lamb at twilight, 















###### 5 







also a tenth of an ephah of finely-milled flour as a grain offering, mixed with a fourth of a hin of pressed oil. 















###### 6 







It is a continual burnt offering which was ordained on Mount Sinai as a sweet _and_ soothing aroma, an offering by fire to the LORD. 















###### 7 







Its drink offering shall be a fourth of a hin for each lamb, in the holy place you shall pour out a strong drink offering to the LORD. 















###### 8 







The other lamb you shall offer at twilight; as the grain offering of the morning and as its drink offering, you shall offer it, an offering by fire, a sweet _and_ soothing aroma to the LORD. 















###### 9 







'Then on the Sabbath day two male lambs one year old without blemish, and two-tenths [of an ephah] of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, and its drink offering. 















###### 10 







This is the burnt offering of every Sabbath, in addition to the continual burnt offering and its drink offering. 















###### 11 







'Then at the beginning of [each of] your months you shall present a burnt offering to the LORD: two bulls, one ram, seven male lambs one year old without blemish; 















###### 12 







and three-tenths [of an ephah] of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, for each bull; and two-tenths [of an ephah] of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, for the one ram; 















###### 13 







and a tenth [of an ephah] of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering for each lamb, as a burnt offering of a sweet _and_ soothing aroma, an offering by fire to the LORD. 















###### 14 







Their drink offerings shall be half a hin of wine for a bull, and a third of a hin for a ram, and a fourth of a hin for a lamb. This is the burnt offering of each month throughout the months of the year. 















###### 15 







And one male goat as a sin offering to the LORD; it shall be offered with its drink offering in addition to the continual burnt offering. 















###### 16 







'The Lord's Passover shall be on the fourteenth day of the first month [of each year]. 















###### 17 







There shall be a feast on the fifteenth day of this month; unleavened bread shall be eaten for seven days. 















###### 18 







On the first day there shall be a holy [summoned] assembly; you shall do no laborious work _that day_. 















###### 19 







But you shall present an offering by fire, a burnt offering to the LORD: two bulls, one ram, and seven male lambs one year old, without blemish. 















###### 20 







For their grain offering you shall offer fine flour mixed with oil; three-tenths [of an ephah] for the bull, and two-tenths for the ram; 















###### 21 







you shall offer a tenth [of an ephah] for each of the seven male lambs; 















###### 22 







and one male goat as a sin offering to make atonement for you. 















###### 23 







You shall present these in addition to the burnt offering of the morning, which is for a continual burnt offering. 















###### 24 







In this way you shall present daily, for seven days, the food of the offering by fire, a sweet _and_ soothing aroma to the LORD; it shall be presented with its drink offering in addition to the continual burnt offering. 















###### 25 







On the seventh day you shall have a holy [summoned] assembly; you shall do no laborious work. 















###### 26 







'Also on the day of the first fruits, when you offer a new grain offering to the LORD at your _Feast of_ Weeks, you shall have a holy [summoned] assembly; you shall do no laborious work. 















###### 27 







You shall present the burnt offering as a sweet _and_ soothing aroma to the LORD: two young bulls, one ram, seven male lambs one year old; 















###### 28 







and their grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil; three-tenths [of an ephah] for each bull, two-tenths for the one ram, 















###### 29 







a tenth for each of the seven male lambs, 















###### 30 







and one male goat to make atonement for you. 















###### 31 







In addition to the continual burnt offering and its grain offering, you shall present them with their drink offerings. They shall be without blemish. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

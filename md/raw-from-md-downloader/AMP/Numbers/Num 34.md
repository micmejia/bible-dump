# Numbers 34

***
















###### 1 







Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 















###### 2 







"Command the Israelites, 'When you enter the land of Canaan, this is the land that shall be yours as an inheritance, the land of Canaan according to its boundaries, 















###### 3 







your southern region shall be from the Wilderness of Zin along the side of Edom, and your southern boundary from the end of the Salt (Dead) Sea eastward. 















###### 4 







Your boundary shall turn from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim, and continue on to Zin, and its limit shall be south of Kadesh-barnea. Then it shall go on to Hazar-addar and pass on to Azmon. 















###### 5 







Then the boundary shall turn from Azmon to the Brook of Egypt (Wadi el-arish), and its limit shall be at the [Mediterranean] Sea. 















###### 6 







'As the western boundary you shall have the Great [Mediterranean] Sea and its coastline. This shall be your western boundary. 















###### 7 







'And this shall be your north border: from the Great [Mediterranean] Sea mark out your boundary line to [^a]Mount Hor; 















###### 8 







from Mount Hor you shall mark out your boundary to the entrance of Hamath, and the limit of the border shall be at Zedad; 















###### 9 







then the [northern] boundary shall go on to Ziphron, and its limit shall be at Hazar-enan. This shall be your northern boundary. 















###### 10 







'You shall mark out your eastern boundary from Hazar-enan to Shepham; 















###### 11 







the [eastern] boundary shall go down from Shepham to Riblah on the east side of Ain and shall descend and reach to the [^b]slope on the east of the Sea of Chinnereth [the Sea of Galilee]; 















###### 12 







and the [eastern] boundary shall go down to the Jordan [River], and its limit shall be at the Salt (Dead) Sea. This shall be your land according to its boundaries all around.'" 















###### 13 







So Moses commanded the Israelites, saying, "This is the land you are to inherit by lot, which the LORD has commanded to be given to the nine tribes and the half-tribe [of Manasseh], 















###### 14 







for the tribe of the sons of Reuben and the tribe of the sons of Gad have received _their inheritance_ by their fathers' households, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their possession. 















###### 15 







The two and a half tribes have received their inheritance across the Jordan [River] opposite Jericho, eastward toward the sunrise." 















###### 16 







Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 















###### 17 







"These are the names of the men who shall divide the land among you as an inheritance: Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun. 















###### 18 







You shall take one leader from every tribe to divide the land for the inheritance. 















###### 19 







These are the names of the men: From the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh; 















###### 20 







from the tribe of the sons of Simeon, Samuel the son of Ammihud; 















###### 21 







from the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon; 















###### 22 







from the tribe of the sons of Dan a leader, Bukki the son of Jogli; 















###### 23 







of the sons of Joseph: from the tribe of the sons of Manasseh a leader, Hanniel the son of Ephod; 















###### 24 







from the tribe of the sons of Ephraim a leader, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan; 















###### 25 







from the tribe of the sons of Zebulun a leader, Elizaphan the son of Parnach; 















###### 26 







from the tribe of the sons of Issachar a leader, Paltiel the son of Azzan; 















###### 27 







from the tribe of the sons of Asher a leader, Ahihud the son of Shelomi; 















###### 28 







from the tribe of the sons of Naphtali a leader, Pedahel the son of Ammihud." 















###### 29 







These are the [twelve] men whom the LORD commanded [to work with Joshua and Eleazar] to divide the inheritance to the sons of Israel in the land of Canaan. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

###### 1 







On the day that Moses had finished setting up the tabernacle and had anointed and consecrated it and all its furniture, and the altar and all its utensils; he also anointed them and consecrated them [for holy use]. 















###### 2 







Then the leaders of Israel, the heads of their fathers' households, made offerings. **(**These were the leaders of the tribes; they were the ones who [^a]were over the men who were numbered.**)** 















###### 3 







They brought their offering before the LORD, six covered carts and twelve oxen; a cart for each two of the leaders and an ox for each one; and they presented them before the tabernacle.

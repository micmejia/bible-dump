# Philemon 1

***
















###### 1 







Paul, a prisoner [for the sake] of Christ Jesus (the Messiah, the Anointed), and our brother Timothy, To Philemon our dearly beloved friend and fellow worker, 















###### 2 







and to [your wife] Apphia our sister, and to [^a]Archippus our fellow soldier [in ministry], and to the [^b]church that meets in your [^c]house: 















###### 3 







Grace to you and peace [inner calm and spiritual well-being] from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. ## Philemon's Love and Faith 















###### 4 







I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers, 















###### 5 







because I hear of your love and of your faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the [^d]saints (God's people). 















###### 6 







I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective _and_ powerful because of your _accurate_ knowledge of every good thing which is ours in Christ. 















###### 7 







For I have had great joy and comfort _and_ encouragement from your love, because the hearts of the saints (God's people) have been refreshed through you, my brother. 















###### 8 







Therefore [on the basis of these facts], though I have enough confidence in Christ to order you to do what is appropriate, 















###### 9 







yet for love's sake I prefer to appeal _to you_--since I am such a person as Paul, an old man, and now also a prisoner [for the sake] of Christ Jesus-- ## A Plea for Onesimus to be Freed 















###### 10 







I appeal to you for my [own spiritual] child Onesimus, whom I have fathered [in the faith] while a captive in these chains. 















###### 11 







Once he was useless to you, but now he is indeed [^e]useful to you as well as to me. 















###### 12 







I have sent him back to you in person, that is, _like sending_ my very heart. 















###### 13 







I would have chosen to keep him with me, so that he might minister to me on your behalf during my imprisonment for the gospel; 















###### 14 







but I did not want to do anything without first getting your consent, so that your goodness would not be, in effect, by compulsion but of your own free will. 















###### 15 







Perhaps it was for this reason that he was separated from you for a while, so that you would have him back forever, 















###### 16 







no longer as a slave, but [as someone] more than a slave, as a brother [in Christ], especially dear to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh [as a servant] and in the Lord [as a fellow believer]. 















###### 17 







So if you consider me a partner, welcome _and_ accept him as you would me. 















###### 18 







But if he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything, charge that to my account; 















###### 19 







I, Paul, write this with my [^f]own hand, I will repay it _in full_ **(**not to mention to you that you [^g]owe to me even your own self as well**)**. 















###### 20 







Yes, brother, let me have some benefit _and_ joy from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ. 















###### 21 







I write to you [perfectly] confident of your obedient compliance, [^h]since I know that you will do even more than I ask. 















###### 22 







At the same time also prepare a guest room for me [in expectation of a visit], for I hope that through your prayers I will be [granted the gracious privilege of] coming to you [at Colossae]. 















###### 23 







Greetings to you from Epaphras, my fellow prisoner here in [the cause of] Christ Jesus, 















###### 24 







and from Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers. 















###### 25 







The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: Philemon 1:2 Philemon was responsible to see that this letter was shared with his fellow Colossian believers. [^c]: Philemon 1:2 Prior to the third century a.d. churches customarily met in private homes. [^d]: Philemon 1:5 All born-again believers (saints) have been reborn from above—spiritually transformed, renewed, made holy and set apart for God’s purpose. [^e]: Philemon 1:11 Paul makes a play on words here because _Onesimus_ means “useful” or “profitable.” [^f]: Philemon 1:19 By writing this with his own hand, Paul accepted legal liability. [^g]: Philemon 1:19 Philemon evidently was saved through Paul’s ministry and therefore owed Paul a debt that could not be repaid. [^h]: Philemon 1:21 This was probably a subtle suggestion by Paul to emancipate Onesimus.

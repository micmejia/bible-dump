# Philippians 2

***
















###### 1 







Therefore if there is any encouragement _and_ comfort in Christ [as there certainly is in abundance], if there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship [that we share] in the Spirit, if [there is] any [great depth of] affection and compassion, 















###### 2 







make my joy complete by being of the same mind, having the same [^a]love [toward one another], knit together in spirit, intent on one purpose [and living a life that reflects your faith and spreads the gospel--the good news regarding salvation through faith in Christ]. 















###### 3 







Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit [through factional motives, or strife], but with [an attitude of] humility [being neither arrogant nor self-righteous], regard others as more important than yourselves. 















###### 4 







Do not _merely_ look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others. 















###### 5 







Have this same attitude in yourselves which was in Christ Jesus [look to Him as your example in selfless humility], 















###### 6 







who, although He existed in the form _and_ unchanging essence of God [as One with Him, possessing the fullness of all the divine attributes--the entire nature of deity], did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped _or_ asserted [as if He did not already possess it, or was afraid of losing it]; 















###### 7 







but emptied Himself [without renouncing or diminishing His deity, but only temporarily giving up the outward expression of divine equality and His rightful dignity] by assuming the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men [He became completely human but was without sin, being fully God and fully man]. 















###### 8 







After He was found in [terms of His] outward appearance as a man [for a divinely-appointed time], He humbled Himself [still further] by becoming obedient [to the Father] to the point of death, even death on a cross. 















###### 9 







For this reason also [because He obeyed and so completely humbled Himself], God has highly exalted Him and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name, 















###### 10 







so that at the name of Jesus [^b]every knee shall bow [in submission], of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, 















###### 11 







and that every tongue will confess _and_ openly acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord (sovereign God), to the glory of God the Father. 















###### 12 







So then, my dear ones, just as you have always obeyed [my instructions with enthusiasm], not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence, continue to work out your salvation [that is, cultivate it, bring it to full effect, actively pursue spiritual maturity] with awe-inspired fear and trembling [using serious caution and critical self-evaluation to avoid anything that might offend God or discredit the name of Christ]. 















###### 13 







For it is [not your strength, but it is] [^c]God who is effectively at work in you, both to will and to work [that is, strengthening, energizing, and creating in you the longing and the ability to fulfill your purpose] for His good pleasure. 















###### 14 







Do everything without murmuring or questioning [the providence of God], 















###### 15 







so that you may prove yourselves to be blameless _and_ guileless, innocent _and_ uncontaminated, children of God without blemish in the midst of a [morally] crooked and [spiritually] perverted generation, among whom you are seen as bright lights [beacons shining out clearly] in the world [of darkness], 















###### 16 







holding out _and_ offering to everyone the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I will have reason to rejoice greatly because I did not run [my race] in vain nor labor without result. 















###### 17 







But even if I am being poured out as a [^d]drink offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith [for preaching the message of salvation], still I rejoice and share my joy with you all. 















###### 18 







You too, rejoice in the same way and share your joy with me. ## Timothy and Epaphroditus 















###### 19 







But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so that I may also be encouraged by learning news about you. 















###### 20 







For I have no one else [like him who is] so kindred a spirit who will be genuinely concerned for your [spiritual] welfare. 















###### 21 







For the others [who deserted me after my arrest] all seek [to advance] their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ. 















###### 22 







But you know of Timothy's tested worth _and_ his proven character, that he has served with me to advance the gospel like a son _serving_ with his father. 















###### 23 







Therefore, I hope [that it is His will] to send him immediately, just as soon as I see how [^e]my case turns out; 















###### 24 







and I trust [confidently] in the Lord that soon I also will be coming _to you_. 















###### 25 







However, I thought it necessary to send _back_ to you Epaphroditus, [who has been] my brother and companion and fellow soldier, who was also _sent as_ your messenger to take care of my needs. 















###### 26 







For he has been longing [^f]for all of you and was distressed because you had heard that he was sick. 















###### 27 







He certainly was sick and close to death. But God had mercy on him, and not only on him but also on me, so that I would not have sorrow upon sorrow. 















###### 28 







So I have sent him all the more eagerly so that when you see him again you may rejoice and I may be less concerned _about you_. 















###### 29 







Welcome him _home_ in the Lord with great joy, and appreciate _and_ honor men like him; 















###### 30 







because he came close to death for the work of Christ, risking his life to complete what was lacking in your service to me [which distance prevented you from rendering personally]. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: Philippians 2:10 All intelligent beings in the universe, whether saved or unsaved, whether in spirit or as mortal mankind, will acknowledge Him. [^c]: Philippians 2:13 God supports the believer, but it is the believer’s responsibility to do what he has been called by God to do. [^d]: Philippians 2:17 The drink offering (wine) was required as part of the sacrificial system of the old covenant. [^e]: Philippians 2:23 Lit _things go with me_. This letter to the Philippians was written near the end of Paul’s two-year period of imprisonment in Rome. This was the first of his two Roman imprisonments. At this time he was under house arrest and was living in his own rented home. About five years after his release he was imprisoned again. Emperor Nero was actively persecuting the Christians during this period, so Paul was held in the Mamertine dungeon (Tullianum). Shortly before his execution Paul wrote his second and final letter to Timothy from his cell in Rome. [^f]: Philippians 2:26 One early ms reads _to see you all_.

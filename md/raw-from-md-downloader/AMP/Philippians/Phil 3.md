# Philippians 3

***
















###### 1 







Finally, my [^a]fellow believers, continue to rejoice _and_ delight in the LORD. To write the same things again is no trouble for me, and it is a safeguard for you. 















###### 2 







Look out for the [^b]dogs [the Judaizers, the legalists], look out for the troublemakers, look out for the [^c]false circumcision [those who claim circumcision is necessary for salvation]; 















###### 3 







for we [who are born-again have been reborn from above--spiritually transformed, renewed, set apart for His purpose and] are the _true_ circumcision, who worship in the Spirit of God and glory _and_ take pride _and_ exult in Christ Jesus and place no confidence [in what we have or who we are] in the flesh-- 















###### 4 







though I myself might have [some grounds for] confidence in the flesh [if I were pursuing salvation by works]. If anyone else thinks that he has reason to be confident in the flesh [that is, in his own efforts to achieve salvation], I _have_ far more: 















###### 5 







circumcised when I was eight days old, of the nation of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews [an exemplary Hebrew]; as to the [observance of the] Law, a Pharisee; 















###### 6 







as to my zeal [for Jewish tradition], a persecutor of the church; and as to righteousness [supposed right living] which [my fellow Jews believe] is in the Law, I proved myself blameless. 















###### 7 







But whatever _former_ things were gains to me [as I thought then], these things [once regarded as advancements in merit] I have come to consider as loss [absolutely worthless] for the sake of Christ [and the purpose which He has given my life]. 















###### 8 







But more than that, I count everything as loss compared to the priceless privilege _and_ supreme advantage of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord [and of growing more deeply and thoroughly acquainted with Him--a joy unequaled]. For His sake I have lost everything, and I consider it all garbage, so that I may gain Christ, 















###### 9 







and may be found in Him [believing and relying on Him], not having any righteousness of my own derived from [my obedience to] the Law _and_ its rituals, but [possessing] that [genuine righteousness] which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith. 















###### 10 







_And this, so_ that I may know Him [experientially, becoming more thoroughly acquainted with Him, understanding the remarkable wonders of His Person more completely] and [in that same way experience] the power of His resurrection [which overflows and is active in believers], and [that I may share] the fellowship of His sufferings, by being _continually_ conformed [inwardly into His likeness even] to His death [dying as He did]; 















###### 11 







[^d]so that I may attain to the resurrection [that will raise me] from the dead. 















###### 12 







Not that I have already obtained it [this goal of being Christlike] or have already been made perfect, but I actively press on [^e]so that I may take hold of that [perfection] for which Christ Jesus took hold of me _and_ made me His own. 















###### 13 







[^f]Brothers and sisters, I do not consider that I have made it my own yet; but one thing _I do_: forgetting what _lies_ behind and reaching forward to what _lies_ ahead, 















###### 14 







I press on toward the goal to win the [heavenly] prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. 















###### 15 







All of us who are mature [pursuing spiritual perfection] should have this attitude. And if in any respect you have a different attitude, that too God will make clear to you. 















###### 16 







Only let us stay true to what we have already attained. 















###### 17 







Brothers and sisters, together follow my example and observe those who live by the pattern we gave you. 















###### 18 







For there are many, of whom I have often told you, and now tell you even with tears, who live as enemies of the cross of Christ [rejecting and opposing His way of salvation], 















###### 19 







whose fate is destruction, whose god is _their_ belly [their worldly appetite, their sensuality, their vanity], and _whose_ glory is in their shame--who focus their mind on earthly _and_ temporal things. 















###### 20 







But [we are different, because] our citizenship is in heaven. And from there we eagerly await [the coming of] the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ; 















###### 21 







who, by exerting that power which enables Him even to subject everything to Himself, will [not only] transform [but completely refashion] our _earthly_ bodies so that they will be like His glorious _resurrected_ body. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: Philippians 3:2 Jews often used “dogs” as a derogatory term to refer to Gentiles, so Paul’s reference to his Jewish opponents in this verse is ironic. Most dogs were untamed scavengers and considered disgusting because they ate anything. [^c]: Philippians 3:2 Because circumcision was not necessary for salvation, the circumcision demanded by the Judaizers was nothing more than mutilation. [^d]: Philippians 3:11 Lit _if somehow_. [^e]: Philippians 3:12 Lit _even if I may_. Paul knew that he could not really reach perfection in this life, but his goal was to “press on” as if it were attainable. [^f]: Philippians 3:13 Lit _Brethren_.

# Philippians 4

***
















###### 1 







Therefore, my [^a]fellow believers, whom I love and long for, my delight and crown [my wreath of victory], in this way stand firm in the Lord, my beloved. 















###### 2 







I urge Euodia and I urge Syntyche to agree _and_ to work in harmony in the Lord. 















###### 3 







Indeed, I ask you too, my true companion, to help these women [to keep on cooperating], for they have shared my struggle in the [cause of the] gospel, together with Clement and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the Book of Life. 















###### 4 







Rejoice in the Lord always [delight, take pleasure in Him]; again I will say, rejoice! 















###### 5 







Let your gentle _spirit_ [your graciousness, unselfishness, mercy, tolerance, and patience] be known to all people. The Lord is near. 















###### 6 







Do not be anxious _or_ worried about anything, but in everything [every circumstance and situation] by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, continue to make your [specific] requests known to God. 















###### 7 







And the peace of God [that peace which reassures the heart, that peace] which transcends all understanding, [that peace which] stands guard over your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus [is yours]. 















###### 8 







Finally, [^b]believers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable _and_ worthy of respect, whatever is right _and_ confirmed by God's word, whatever is pure _and_ wholesome, whatever is lovely _and_ brings peace, whatever is admirable _and_ of good repute; if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think _continually_ on these things [center your mind on them, and implant them in your heart]. 















###### 9 







The things which you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, practice these things [in daily life], and the God [who is the source] of peace _and_ well-being will be with you. ## God's Provisions 















###### 10 







I rejoiced greatly in the Lord, that now at last you have renewed your concern for me; indeed, you were concerned about me _before_, but you had no opportunity to show it. 















###### 11 







Not that I speak from [any personal] need, for I have learned to be content [and self-sufficient through Christ, satisfied to the point where I am not disturbed or uneasy] regardless of my circumstances. 















###### 12 







I know how to get along and live humbly [in difficult times], and I also know how to enjoy abundance _and_ live in prosperity. In any and every circumstance I have learned the secret [of facing life], whether well-fed or going hungry, whether having an abundance or being in need. 















###### 13 







I can do all things [which He has called me to do] through Him who strengthens _and_ empowers me [to fulfill His purpose--I am self-sufficient in Christ's sufficiency; I am ready for anything and equal to anything through Him who infuses me with inner strength and confident peace.] 















###### 14 







Nevertheless, it was right of you to share [with me] in my difficulties. 















###### 15 







And you Philippians know that in the early days of preaching the gospel, after I left Macedonia, no church shared with me in the matter of [^c]giving and receiving except you alone; 















###### 16 







for even in Thessalonica you sent _a gift_ more than once for my needs. 















###### 17 







Not that I seek the gift itself, but I do seek the profit which increases to your [heavenly] account [the blessing which is accumulating for you]. 















###### 18 







But I have received everything in full and more; I am amply supplied, having received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent me. They are the fragrant aroma of an offering, an acceptable sacrifice which God welcomes _and_ in which He delights. 















###### 19 







And my God will liberally supply (fill until full) your every need according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus. 















###### 20 







To our God and Father be the glory [^d]forever and ever. Amen. 















###### 21 







Remember me to every [^e]saint in Christ Jesus. The [^f]brothers who are with me greet you. 















###### 22 







All [^g]God's people wish to be remembered to you, especially those of Caesar's household. 















###### 23 







The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

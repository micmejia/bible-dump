# Proverbs 1

***
















###### 1 







The proverbs (truths obscurely expressed, maxims) of Solomon son of David, king of Israel: 















###### 2 







To know [skillful and godly] wisdom and instruction; To discern _and_ comprehend the words of understanding _and_ insight, 















###### 3 







To receive instruction in wise behavior _and_ the discipline of wise thoughtfulness, Righteousness, justice, and integrity; 















###### 4 







That prudence (good judgment, astute common sense) may be given to the naive _or_ inexperienced [who are easily misled], And knowledge and discretion (intelligent discernment) to the youth, 















###### 5 







The wise will hear and increase their learning, And the person of understanding will acquire wise counsel _and_ the skill [to steer his course wisely and lead others to the truth], 















###### 6 







To understand a proverb and a figure [of speech] _or_ an enigma with its interpretation, And the words of the wise and their riddles [that require reflection]. 















###### 7 







The [reverent] fear of the LORD [that is, worshiping Him and regarding Him as truly awesome] is the beginning _and_ the preeminent part of knowledge [its starting point and its essence]; _But arrogant_ [^a]fools despise [skillful and godly] wisdom and instruction _and_ self-discipline. ## The Enticement of Sinners 















###### 8 







My son, hear the instruction of your father, And do not reject the teaching of your mother. 















###### 9 







For they are a garland of grace on your head, And chains _and_ ornaments [of gold] around your neck. 















###### 10 







My son, if sinners entice you, Do not consent. 















###### 11 







If they say, "Come with us; Let us lie in wait to _shed_ blood, Let us ambush the innocent without cause; 















###### 12 







Let us swallow them alive like Sheol (the place of the dead), Even whole, as those who go down to the pit [of death]; 















###### 13 







We will find _and_ take all kinds of precious possessions, We will fill our houses with spoil; 















###### 14 







Throw in your lot with us [they insist]; We will all have one money bag [in common]," 















###### 15 







My son, do not walk on the road with them; Keep your foot [far] away from their path, 















###### 16 







For their feet run to evil, And they hurry to shed blood. 















###### 17 







Indeed, it is useless to spread the _baited_ net In the sight of any bird; 















###### 18 







But [when these people set a trap for others] they lie in wait for their own blood; They set an ambush for their own lives [and rush to their destruction]. 















###### 19 







So are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain; Greed takes away the lives of its possessors. ## Wisdom Warns 















###### 20 







[^b]Wisdom shouts in the street, She raises her voice in the markets; 















###### 21 







She calls out at the head of the noisy streets [where large crowds gather]; At the entrance of the city gates she speaks her words: 















###### 22 







"How long, O naive ones [you who are easily misled], will you love being simple-minded _and_ undiscerning? _How long_ will scoffers [who ridicule and deride] delight in scoffing, _How long_ will fools [who obstinately mock truth] hate knowledge? 















###### 23 







"If you will turn _and_ pay attention to my rebuke, Behold, I [Wisdom] will pour out my spirit on you; I will make my words known to you. 















###### 24 







"Because I called and you refused [to answer], I stretched out my hand and no one has paid attention [to my offer]; 















###### 25 







And you treated all my counsel as nothing And would not accept my reprimand, 















###### 26 







I also will laugh at your disaster; I will mock when your dread _and_ panic come, 















###### 27 







When your dread _and_ panic come like a storm, And your disaster comes like a whirlwind, When anxiety and distress come upon you [as retribution]. 















###### 28 







"Then they will call upon me (Wisdom), but I will not answer; They will seek me eagerly but they will not find me, 















###### 29 







Because they hated knowledge And did not choose the fear of the LORD [that is, obeying Him with reverence and awe-filled respect], 















###### 30 







They would not accept my counsel, And they spurned all my rebuke. 















###### 31 







"Therefore they shall eat of the fruit of their own [wicked] way And be satiated with [the penalty of] their own devices. 















###### 32 







"For the turning away of the [^c]naive will kill them, And the careless ease of [self-righteous] fools will destroy them. 















###### 33 







"But whoever listens to me (Wisdom) will live securely _and_ in confident trust And will be at ease, without fear _or_ dread of evil." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Proverbs 10

***
















###### 1 







The proverbs of Solomon: A wise son makes a father glad, But a foolish [stubborn] son [who refuses to learn] is a grief to his mother. 















###### 2 







Treasures of wickedness _and_ ill-gotten gains do not profit, But righteousness _and_ moral integrity in daily life rescues from death. 















###### 3 







The LORD will not allow the [^a]righteous to hunger [God will meet all his needs], But He will reject _and_ cast away the craving of the wicked. 















###### 4 







Poor is he who works with a negligent _and_ idle hand, But the hand of the diligent makes _him_ rich. 















###### 5 







He who gathers during summer _and_ takes advantage of his opportunities is a son who acts wisely, _But_ he who sleeps during harvest _and_ ignores the moment of opportunity is a son who acts shamefully. 















###### 6 







Blessings are on the head of the righteous [the upright, those in right standing with God], But the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 















###### 7 







The [^b]memory of the righteous [person] is a [source of] blessing, But the name of the wicked will [be forgotten and] rot [like a corpse]. 















###### 8 







The wise in heart [are willing to learn so they] will accept _and_ obey commands (instruction), But the babbling fool [who is arrogant and thinks himself wise] will come to ruin. 















###### 9 







He who walks in integrity _and_ with moral character walks securely, But he who takes a crooked way will be discovered _and_ punished. 















###### 10 







He who [maliciously] winks the eye [of evil intent] causes trouble; And the babbling fool [who is arrogant and thinks himself wise] will come to ruin. 















###### 11 







The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life _and_ his words of wisdom are a source of blessing, But the mouth of the wicked conceals violence _and_ evil. 















###### 12 







Hatred stirs up strife, But love covers _and_ overwhelms all transgressions [forgiving and overlooking another's faults]. 















###### 13 







On the lips of the discerning, [skillful and godly] wisdom is found, But discipline _and_ the rod are for the back of the one who is without common sense _and_ understanding. 















###### 14 







Wise men store up _and_ treasure knowledge [in mind and heart], But with the mouth of the foolish, ruin is at hand. 















###### 15 







The rich man's wealth is his fortress; The ruin of the poor is their poverty. 















###### 16 







The wages of the righteous [the upright, those in right standing with God] is [a worthwhile, meaningful] life, The income of the wicked, punishment. 















###### 17 







He who learns from instruction _and_ correction is on the [right] path of life [and for others his example is a path toward wisdom and blessing], But he who ignores _and_ refuses correction goes off course [and for others his example is a path toward sin and ruin]. 















###### 18 







He who hides hatred has lying lips, And he who spreads slander is a fool. 















###### 19 







When there are many words, transgression _and_ offense are unavoidable, But he who controls his lips _and_ keeps thoughtful silence is wise. 















###### 20 







The tongue of the righteous is like precious silver (greatly valued); The heart of the wicked is worth little. 















###### 21 







The lips of the righteous feed _and_ guide many, But fools [who reject God and His wisdom] die for lack of understanding. 















###### 22 







The blessing of the LORD brings [true] riches, And He adds no sorrow to it [for it comes as a blessing from God]. 















###### 23 







Engaging in evil is like sport to the fool [who refuses wisdom and chases sin], But to a man of understanding [skillful and godly] wisdom _brings joy_. 















###### 24 







What the wicked fears will come upon him, But the desire of the righteous [for the blessings of God] will be granted. 















###### 25 







When the whirlwind passes, the wicked is no more, But the righteous has an everlasting foundation. 















###### 26 







Like vinegar to the teeth and smoke to the eyes, So is the lazy one to those who send him _to work_. 















###### 27 







The [reverent] fear of the LORD [worshiping, obeying, serving, and trusting Him with awe-filled respect] prolongs one's life, But the years of the wicked will be shortened. 















###### 28 







The hope of the righteous [those of honorable character and integrity] is joy, But the expectation of the wicked [those who oppose God and ignore His wisdom] comes to nothing. 















###### 29 







The way of the LORD is a stronghold to the upright, But it is ruin to those who do evil. 















###### 30 







The [consistently] righteous will never be shaken, But the wicked will not inhabit the earth. 















###### 31 







The mouth of the righteous flows with [skillful and godly] wisdom, But the perverted tongue will be cut out. 















###### 32 







The lips of the righteous know (speak) what is acceptable, But the mouth of the wicked knows (speaks) what is perverted (twisted). ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

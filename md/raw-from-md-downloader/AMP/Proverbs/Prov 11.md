# Proverbs 11

***
















###### 1 







A false balance _and_ dishonest business practices are extremely offensive to the LORD, But an accurate scale is His delight. 















###### 2 







When pride comes [boiling up with an arrogant attitude of self-importance], then come dishonor _and_ shame, But with the humble [the teachable who have been chiseled by trial and who have learned to walk humbly with God] there is wisdom _and_ soundness of mind. 















###### 3 







The integrity _and_ moral courage of the upright will guide them, But the crookedness of the treacherous will destroy them. 















###### 4 







Riches will not provide security in the day of wrath _and_ judgment, But righteousness rescues from death. 















###### 5 







The righteousness of the blameless will smooth their way _and_ keep it straight, But the wicked will fall by his own wickedness. 















###### 6 







The righteousness of the upright will rescue them, But the treacherous will be caught by their own greed. 















###### 7 







When the wicked man dies, his expectation will perish; And the hope of [godless] strong men perishes. 















###### 8 







[^a]The righteous is rescued from trouble, And the wicked takes his place. 















###### 9 







With his mouth the godless man destroys his neighbor, But through knowledge _and_ discernment the righteous will be rescued. 















###### 10 







When it goes well for the righteous, the city rejoices, And when the wicked perish, there are shouts of joy. 















###### 11 







By the blessing [of the influence] of the upright the city is exalted, But by the mouth of the wicked it is torn down. 















###### 12 







He who despises his neighbor lacks sense, But a man of understanding keeps silent. 















###### 13 







He who goes about as a gossip reveals secrets, But he who is trustworthy _and_ faithful keeps a matter hidden. 















###### 14 







Where there is no [wise, intelligent] guidance, the people fall [and go off course like a ship without a helm], But in the abundance of [wise and godly] counselors there is victory. 















###### 15 







He who puts up security _and_ guarantees a debt for an outsider will surely suffer [for his foolishness], But he who hates (declines) being a guarantor is secure [from its penalties]. 















###### 16 







A gracious _and_ good woman attains honor, And ruthless men attain riches [but not respect]. 















###### 17 







The merciful _and_ generous man benefits his soul [for his behavior returns to bless him], But the cruel _and_ callous man does himself harm. 















###### 18 







The wicked man earns deceptive wages, But he who sows righteousness _and_ lives his life with integrity will have a true reward [that is both permanent and satisfying]. 















###### 19 







He who is steadfast in righteousness _attains_ life, But he who pursues evil _attains_ his own death. 















###### 20 







The perverse in heart are repulsive _and_ shamefully vile to the LORD, But those who are blameless _and_ above reproach in their walk are His delight! 















###### 21 







Assuredly, the evil man will not go unpunished, But the descendants of the righteous will be freed. 















###### 22 







As a ring of gold in a swine's snout, So is a beautiful woman who is without discretion [her lack of character mocks her beauty]. 















###### 23 







The desire of the righteous brings only good, But the expectation of the wicked brings wrath. 















###### 24 







There is the one who [generously] scatters [abroad], and yet increases all the more; And there is the one who withholds what is justly due, _but it results_ only in want _and_ poverty. 















###### 25 







The generous man [is a source of blessing and] shall be prosperous _and_ enriched, And he who waters will himself be watered [reaping the generosity he has sown]. 















###### 26 







The people curse him who holds back grain [when the public needs it], But a blessing [from God and man] is upon the head of him who sells it. 















###### 27 







He who diligently seeks good seeks favor _and_ grace, But he who seeks evil, evil will come to him. 















###### 28 







He who leans on _and_ trusts in _and_ is confident in his riches will fall, But the righteous [who trust in God's provision] will flourish like a _green_ leaf. 















###### 29 







He who troubles (mismanages) his own house will inherit the wind (nothing), And the foolish will be a servant to the wise-hearted. 















###### 30 







The fruit of the [consistently] righteous is a tree of life, And he who is wise captures _and_ wins souls [for God--he gathers them for eternity]. 















###### 31 







If the righteous will be rewarded on the earth [with godly blessings], How much more [will] the wicked and the sinner [be repaid with punishment]! ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

He said that a fox once told a wolf to come with him and he would give him abundant food. It was night, and the fox led the wolf to a well with a bucket at each end of the rope. The fox got into the bucket at the top of the well and rode down to the bottom. When the wolf asked him what he was doing, the fox pointed to the reflection of the moon in the water and said, “There is plenty of cheese and meat down here. Get in the other bucket and come down right away!” The wolf did, and as he went down the fox was pulled up in the first bucket. When the fox got to the top, the wolf said, “How am I supposed to get out?” Thereupon the fox quoted this verse to him.

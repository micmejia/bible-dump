# Proverbs 12

***
















###### 1 







Whoever loves instruction _and_ discipline loves knowledge, But he who hates reproof _and_ correction is stupid. 















###### 2 







A good man will obtain favor from the LORD, But He will condemn a man who devises evil. 















###### 3 







A man will not be established by wickedness, But the root of the [consistently] righteous will not be moved. 















###### 4 







A virtuous _and_ excellent wife [worthy of honor] is the crown of her husband, But she who shames him [with her foolishness] is like rottenness in his bones. 















###### 5 







The thoughts _and_ purposes of the [consistently] righteous are just (honest, reliable), But the counsels _and_ schemes of the wicked are deceitful. 















###### 6 







The [malevolent] words of the wicked lie in wait for [innocent] blood [to slander], But the mouth of the upright will rescue _and_ protect them. 















###### 7 







The wicked are overthrown [by their evil] and are no more, But the house of the [consistently] righteous will stand [securely]. 















###### 8 







A man will be commended according to his insight _and_ sound judgment, But the one who is of a perverse mind will be despised. 















###### 9 







[^a]Better is he who is lightly esteemed and has a servant, Than he who [boastfully] honors himself [pretending to be what he is not] and lacks bread. 















###### 10 







A righteous man has kind regard for the life of his animal, But even the compassion of the wicked is cruel. 















###### 11 







He who tills his land will have plenty of bread, But he who follows worthless _things_ lacks common sense _and_ good judgment. 















###### 12 







The wicked desire the plunder of evil men, But the root of the righteous yields _richer_ fruit. 















###### 13 







An evil man is [dangerously] ensnared by the transgression of his lips, But the righteous will escape from trouble. 















###### 14 







A man will be satisfied with good from the fruit of his words, And the deeds of a man's hands will return to him [as a harvest]. 















###### 15 







The way of the [arrogant] fool [who rejects God's wisdom] is right in his own eyes, But a wise _and_ prudent man is he who listens to counsel. 















###### 16 







The [arrogant] fool's anger is quickly known [because he lacks self-control and common sense], But a prudent man ignores an insult. 















###### 17 







He who speaks truth [when he testifies] tells what is right, But a false witness utters deceit [in court]. 















###### 18 







There is one who speaks rashly like the thrusts of a sword, But the tongue of the wise brings healing. 















###### 19 







Truthful lips will be established forever, But a lying tongue is [credited] only for a moment. 















###### 20 







Deceit is in the heart of those who devise evil, But counselors of peace have joy. 















###### 21 







No harm befalls the righteous, But the wicked are filled with trouble. 















###### 22 







Lying lips are extremely disgusting to the LORD, But those who deal faithfully are His delight. 















###### 23 







A shrewd man is reluctant to display his knowledge [until the proper time], But the heart of [over-confident] fools proclaims foolishness. 















###### 24 







The hand of the diligent will rule, But the negligent _and_ lazy will be put to forced labor. 















###### 25 







Anxiety in a man's heart weighs it down, But a good (encouraging) word makes it glad. 















###### 26 







The righteous man is a guide to his neighbor, But the way of the wicked leads them astray. 















###### 27 







The lazy man does not catch _and_ roast his prey, But the precious possession of a [wise] man is diligence [because he recognizes opportunities and seizes them]. 















###### 28 







In the way of righteousness is life, And in its pathway there is no death [but immortality--eternal life]. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

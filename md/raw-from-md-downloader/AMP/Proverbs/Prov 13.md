# Proverbs 13

***
















###### 1 







A wise son heeds _and_ accepts [and is the result of] his father's discipline _and_ instruction, But a scoffer does not listen to reprimand _and_ does not learn from his errors. 















###### 2 







From the fruit of his mouth a [wise] man enjoys good, But the desire of the treacherous is for violence. 















###### 3 







The one who guards his mouth [thinking before he speaks] protects his life; The one who opens his lips wide [and chatters without thinking] comes to ruin. 















###### 4 







The soul (appetite) of the lazy person craves and gets nothing [for lethargy overcomes ambition], But the soul (appetite) of the diligent [who works willingly] is rich _and_ abundantly supplied. 















###### 5 







A righteous man hates lies, But a wicked man is loathsome, and he acts shamefully. 















###### 6 







Righteousness (being in right standing with God) guards the one whose way is blameless, But wickedness undermines _and_ overthrows the sinner. 















###### 7 







There is one who pretends to be rich, yet has nothing at all; _Another_ pretends to be poor, yet has great wealth. 















###### 8 







The ransom for a man's life is his wealth, But the poor man does not even have to listen to a rebuke _or_ threats [from the envious]. 















###### 9 







The light of the righteous [within him--grows brighter and] rejoices, But the lamp of the wicked [is a temporary light and] goes out. 















###### 10 







Through pride _and_ presumption come nothing but strife, But [skillful and godly] wisdom is with those who welcome [well-advised] counsel. 















###### 11 







Wealth _obtained_ by fraud dwindles, But he who gathers gradually by [honest] labor will increase [his riches]. 















###### 12 







Hope deferred makes the heart sick, But when desire is fulfilled, it is a tree of life. 















###### 13 







Whoever despises the word _and_ counsel [of God] brings destruction upon himself, But he who [reverently] fears _and_ respects the commandment [of God] will be rewarded. 















###### 14 







The teaching of the wise is a fountain _and_ source of life, So that one may avoid the snares of death. 















###### 15 







Good understanding wins favor [from others], But the way of the unfaithful is hard [like barren, dry soil]. 















###### 16 







Every prudent _and_ self-disciplined man acts with knowledge, But a [closed-minded] fool [who refuses to learn] displays his foolishness [for all to see]. 















###### 17 







A wicked messenger falls into hardship, But a faithful ambassador brings healing. 















###### 18 







Poverty and shame will come to him who refuses instruction _and_ discipline, But he who accepts _and_ learns from reproof _or_ censure is honored. 















###### 19 







Desire realized is sweet to the soul; But it is detestable to fools to turn away from evil [which they have planned]. 















###### 20 







He who walks [as a companion] with wise men will be wise, But the companions of [conceited, dull-witted] fools [are fools themselves and] will experience harm. 















###### 21 







Adversity pursues sinners, But the [consistently] upright will be rewarded with prosperity. 















###### 22 







A good man leaves an inheritance to his children's children, And the wealth of the sinner is stored up for [the hands of] the righteous. 















###### 23 







Abundant food is in the fallow (uncultivated) ground of the poor, But [without protection] it is swept away by injustice. 















###### 24 







He who withholds the rod [of discipline] hates his son, But he who loves him disciplines _and_ trains him diligently _and_ appropriately [with wisdom and love]. 















###### 25 







The [consistently] righteous has enough to satisfy his appetite, But the stomach of the wicked is in need [of bread]. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

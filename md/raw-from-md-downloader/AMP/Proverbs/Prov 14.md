# Proverbs 14

***
















###### 1 







The wise woman builds her house [on a foundation of godly precepts, and her household thrives], But the foolish one [who lacks spiritual insight] tears it down with her own hands [by ignoring godly principles]. 















###### 2 







He who walks in uprightness [reverently] fears the LORD [and obeys and worships Him with profound respect], But he who is devious in his ways despises Him. 















###### 3 







In the mouth of the [arrogant] [^a]fool [who rejects God] is a rod for his back, But the lips of the wise [when they speak with godly wisdom] will protect them. 















###### 4 







Where there are no oxen, the manger is clean, But much revenue [because of good crops] comes by the strength of the ox. 















###### 5 







A faithful _and_ trustworthy witness will not lie, But a false witness speaks lies. 















###### 6 







A scoffer seeks wisdom and finds none [for his ears are closed to wisdom], But knowledge is easy for one who understands [because he is willing to learn]. 















###### 7 







Leave the presence of a [shortsighted] fool, For you will not find knowledge _or_ hear godly wisdom from his lips. 















###### 8 







The wisdom of the sensible is to understand his way, But the foolishness of [shortsighted] fools is deceit. 















###### 9 







Fools mock sin [but sin mocks the fools], But among the upright there is good will _and_ the favor _and_ blessing of God. 















###### 10 







The heart knows its own bitterness, And no stranger shares its joy. 















###### 11 







The house of the wicked will be overthrown, But the tent of the upright will thrive. 















###### 12 







There is a way _which seems_ right to a man _and_ appears straight before him, But its end is the way of death. 















###### 13 







Even in laughter the heart may be in pain, And the end of joy may be grief. 















###### 14 







The backslider in heart will have his fill with his own [rotten] ways, But a good man will _be satisfied_ with his ways [the godly thought and action which his heart pursues and in which he delights]. 















###### 15 







The naive _or_ inexperienced person [is easily misled and] believes every word he hears, But the prudent man [is discreet and astute and] considers well where he is going. 















###### 16 







A wise man suspects danger and cautiously avoids evil, But the fool is arrogant and careless. 















###### 17 







A quick-tempered man acts foolishly _and_ without self-control, And a man of wicked schemes is hated. 















###### 18 







The naive [are unsophisticated and easy to exploit and] inherit foolishness, But the sensible [are thoughtful and far-sighted and] are crowned with knowledge. 















###### 19 







The evil will bow down before the good, And the wicked [will bow down] at the gates of the righteous. 















###### 20 







The poor man is hated even by his neighbor, But those who love the rich are many. 















###### 21 







He who despises his neighbor sins [against God and his fellow man], But happy [blessed and favored by God] is he who is gracious _and_ merciful to the poor. 















###### 22 







Do they not go astray who devise evil _and_ wander from the way of righteousness? But kindness and truth will be to those who devise good. 















###### 23 







In all labor there is profit, But mere talk leads only to poverty. 















###### 24 







The crown of the wise is their wealth [of wisdom], But the foolishness of [closed-minded] fools is [nothing but] folly. 















###### 25 







A truthful witness saves lives, But he who speaks lies is treacherous. 















###### 26 







In the [reverent] fear of the LORD there is strong confidence, And His children will [always] have a place of refuge. 















###### 27 







The [reverent] fear of the LORD [that leads to obedience and worship] is a fountain of life, So that one may avoid the snares of death. 















###### 28 







In a multitude of people is a king's glory, But in a lack of people is a [pretentious] prince's ruin. 















###### 29 







He who is slow to anger has great understanding [and profits from his self-control], But he who is quick-tempered exposes _and_ exalts his foolishness [for all to see]. 















###### 30 







A calm _and_ peaceful _and_ tranquil heart is life _and_ health to the body, But passion _and_ envy are like rottenness to the bones. 















###### 31 







He who oppresses the poor taunts _and_ insults his Maker, But he who is kind _and_ merciful _and_ gracious to the needy honors Him. 















###### 32 







The wicked is overthrown through his wrongdoing, But the righteous has hope _and_ confidence _and_ a refuge [with God] even in death. 















###### 33 







Wisdom rests [silently] in the heart of one who has understanding, But what is in the heart of [shortsighted] fools is made known. 















###### 34 







Righteousness [moral and spiritual integrity and virtuous character] exalts a nation, But sin is a disgrace to any people. 















###### 35 







The king's favor _and_ good will are toward a servant who acts wisely _and_ discreetly, But his anger _and_ wrath are toward him who acts shamefully. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

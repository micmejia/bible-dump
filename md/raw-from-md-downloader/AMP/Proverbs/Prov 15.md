# Proverbs 15

***
















###### 1 







A soft _and_ gentle _and_ thoughtful answer turns away wrath, But harsh _and_ painful _and_ careless words stir up anger. 















###### 2 







The tongue of the wise speaks knowledge that is pleasing _and_ acceptable, But the [babbling] mouth of fools spouts folly. 















###### 3 







The eyes of the LORD are in every place, Watching the evil and the good [in all their endeavors]. 















###### 4 







A soothing tongue [speaking words that build up and encourage] is a tree of life, But a perversive tongue [speaking words that overwhelm and depress] crushes the spirit. 















###### 5 







A [flippant, arrogant] fool rejects his father's instruction _and_ correction, But he who [is willing to learn and] regards _and_ keeps in mind a reprimand acquires good sense. 















###### 6 







Great _and_ priceless treasure is in the house of the [consistently] righteous one [who seeks godly instruction and grows in wisdom], But trouble is in the income of the wicked one [who rejects the laws of God]. 















###### 7 







The lips of the wise spread knowledge [sifting it as chaff from the grain]; But the hearts of [shortsighted] fools are not so. 















###### 8 







The sacrifice of the wicked is hateful _and_ exceedingly offensive to the LORD, But the prayer of the upright is His delight! 















###### 9 







The way [of life] of the wicked is hateful _and_ exceedingly offensive to the LORD, But He loves one who pursues righteousness [personal integrity, moral courage and honorable character]. 















###### 10 







There is severe discipline for him who [^a]turns from the way [of righteousness]; And he who hates correction will die. 















###### 11 







Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead) and Abaddon (the abyss, the place of eternal punishment) _lie open_ before the LORD-- How much more the hearts _and_ inner motives of the children of men. 















###### 12 







A scoffer [unlike a wise man] resents one who rebukes him _and_ tries to teach him; Nor will he go to the wise [for counsel and instruction]. 















###### 13 







A heart full of joy _and_ goodness makes a cheerful face, But when a heart is full of sadness the spirit is crushed. 















###### 14 







The mind of the intelligent _and_ discerning seeks knowledge _and_ eagerly inquires after it, But the mouth of the [stubborn] fool feeds on foolishness. 















###### 15 







All the days of the afflicted are bad, But a glad heart has a continual feast [regardless of the circumstances]. 















###### 16 







Better is a little with the [reverent, worshipful] fear of the LORD Than great treasure and trouble with it. 















###### 17 







Better is a dinner of vegetables _and_ herbs where love is present Than a fattened ox served with hatred. 















###### 18 







A hot-tempered man stirs up strife, But he who is slow to anger _and_ patient calms disputes. 















###### 19 







The way of the lazy is like a hedge of thorns [it pricks, lacerates, and entangles him], But the way [of life] of the upright is smooth _and_ open like a highway. 















###### 20 







A wise son makes a father glad, But a foolish man despises his mother. 















###### 21 







Foolishness is joy to him who is without heart _and_ lacks [intelligent, common] sense, But a man of understanding walks uprightly [making his course straight]. 















###### 22 







Without consultation _and_ wise advice, plans are frustrated, But with many counselors they are established and succeed. 















###### 23 







A man has joy in giving an appropriate answer, And how good _and_ delightful is a word spoken at the right moment--how good it is! 















###### 24 







The [chosen] path of life leads upward for the wise, That he may keep away from Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead) below. 















###### 25 







The LORD will tear down the house of the proud _and_ arrogant (self-righteous), But He will establish _and_ protect the boundaries [of the land] of the [godly] widow. 















###### 26 







Evil plans _and_ thoughts of the wicked are exceedingly vile _and_ offensive to the LORD, But pure words are pleasant words to Him. 















###### 27 







He who profits unlawfully brings suffering to his own house, But he who hates bribes [and does not receive nor pay them] will live. 















###### 28 







The heart of the righteous thinks carefully about how to answer [in a wise and appropriate and timely way], But the [babbling] mouth of the wicked pours out malevolent things. 















###### 29 







The LORD is far from the wicked [and distances Himself from them], But He hears the prayer of the [consistently] righteous [that is, those with spiritual integrity and moral courage]. 















###### 30 







The light of the eyes rejoices the hearts of others, And good news puts fat on the bones. 















###### 31 







The ear that listens to _and_ learns from the life-giving rebuke (reprimand, censure) Will remain among the wise. 















###### 32 







He who neglects _and_ ignores instruction _and_ discipline despises himself, But he who learns from rebuke acquires understanding [and grows in wisdom]. 















###### 33 







The [reverent] fear of the LORD [that is, worshiping Him and regarding Him as truly awesome] is the instruction for wisdom [its starting point and its essence]; And before honor comes humility. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

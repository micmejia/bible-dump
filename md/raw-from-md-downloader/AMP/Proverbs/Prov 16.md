# Proverbs 16

***
















###### 1 







The plans _and_ reflections of the heart belong to man, But the [wise] answer of the tongue is from the LORD. 















###### 2 







All the ways of a man are clean _and_ innocent in his own eyes [and he may see nothing wrong with his actions], But the LORD weighs _and_ examines the motives _and_ intents [of the heart and knows the truth]. 















###### 3 







[^a]Commit your works to the LORD [submit and trust them to Him], And your plans will succeed [if you respond to His will and guidance]. 















###### 4 







The LORD has made everything for its own purpose, Even the wicked [according to their role] for the day of evil. 















###### 5 







Everyone who is proud _and_ arrogant in heart is disgusting _and_ exceedingly offensive to the LORD; Be assured he will not go unpunished. 















###### 6 







By mercy _and_ lovingkindness and truth [not superficial ritual] wickedness is cleansed from the heart, And by the fear of the LORD one avoids evil. 















###### 7 







When a man's ways please the LORD, He makes even his enemies to be at peace with him. 















###### 8 







Better is a little with righteousness Than great income [gained] with injustice. 















###### 9 







A man's mind plans his way [as he journeys through life], But the LORD directs his steps _and_ establishes them. 















###### 10 







A divine decision [given by God] is on the lips of the king [as His representative]; His mouth should not be unfaithful _or_ unjust in judgment. 















###### 11 







A just balance and [honest] scales are the Lord's; All the weights of the bag are His concern [established by His eternal principles]. 















###### 12 







It is repulsive [to God and man] for kings to behave wickedly, For a throne is established on righteousness (right standing with God). 















###### 13 







Righteous lips are the delight of kings, And he who speaks right is loved. 















###### 14 







The wrath of a king is like a messenger of death, But a wise man will appease it. 















###### 15 







In the light of the king's face is life, And his favor is like a cloud bringing the spring rain. 















###### 16 







How much better it is to get wisdom than gold! And to get understanding is to be chosen above silver. 















###### 17 







The highway of the upright turns away _and_ departs from evil; He who guards his way protects his life (soul). 















###### 18 







Pride goes before destruction, And a haughty spirit before a fall. 















###### 19 







It is better to be humble in spirit with the lowly Than to divide the spoil with the proud (haughty, arrogant). 















###### 20 







He who pays attention to the word [of God] will find good, And blessed (happy, prosperous, to be admired) is he who trusts [confidently] in the LORD. 















###### 21 







The wise in heart will be called understanding, And sweet speech increases persuasiveness _and_ learning [in both speaker and listener]. 















###### 22 







Understanding (spiritual insight) is a [refreshing and boundless] wellspring of life to those who have it, But to give instruction _and_ correction to fools is foolishness. 















###### 23 







The heart of the wise instructs his mouth [in wisdom] And adds persuasiveness to his lips. 















###### 24 







Pleasant words are like a honeycomb, Sweet _and_ delightful to the soul and healing to the body. 















###### 25 







There is a way which seems right to a man _and_ appears straight before him, But its end is the way of death. 















###### 26 







The appetite of a worker works for him, For his hunger urges him on. 















###### 27 







A worthless man devises _and_ digs up evil, And the words on his lips are like a scorching fire. 















###### 28 







A perverse man spreads strife, And one who gossips separates intimate friends. 















###### 29 







A violent _and_ exceedingly covetous man entices his neighbor [to sin], And leads him in a way that is not good. 















###### 30 







He who [slyly] winks his eyes does so to plot perverse things; And he who compresses his lips [as if in a secret signal] brings evil to pass. 















###### 31 







The silver-haired head is a crown of splendor _and_ glory; It is found in the way of righteousness. 















###### 32 







He who is slow to anger is better _and_ more honorable than the mighty [soldier], And he who rules _and_ controls his own spirit, than he who captures a city. 















###### 33 







The lot is cast into the lap, [^b]But its every decision is from the LORD. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: Proverbs 16:33 This is the reason why the casting of lots was sanctioned in Israel for certain cases of decision-making (e.g. Lev 16:8; Josh 18:6, 8; 1 Chr 25:8, etc.). It was understood that the outcomes were controlled by God, and the seemingly random procedure eliminated human influence. The last time the ritual is mentioned in the Bible is in the choice of Matthias to replace Judas (Acts 1:26). Many believe that the filling of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost in Acts 2 officially put an end to the ritual because it was then replaced by the direct guidance of the Spirit. It was never sanctioned or recommended as a way to determine Godâ€™s will in personal decision-making.

# Proverbs 17

***
















###### 1 







Better is a dry morsel [of food served] with quietness _and_ peace Than a house full of feasting [served] with strife _and_ contention. 















###### 2 







A wise servant will rule over the [unworthy] son who acts shamefully _and_ brings disgrace [to the family] And [the worthy servant] will share in the inheritance among the brothers. 















###### 3 







The refining pot is for silver and the furnace for gold, But the LORD tests hearts. 















###### 4 







An evildoer listens closely to wicked lips; And a liar pays attention to a destructive _and_ malicious tongue. 















###### 5 







Whoever mocks the poor taunts his Maker, And he who rejoices at [another's] disaster will not go unpunished. 















###### 6 







Grandchildren are the crown of aged men, And the glory of children is their fathers [who live godly lives]. 















###### 7 







Excellent speech does not benefit a fool [who is spiritually blind], Much less do lying lips _benefit_ a prince. 















###### 8 







A bribe is like a bright, precious stone in the eyes of its owner; Wherever he turns, he prospers. 















###### 9 







He who covers _and_ forgives an offense seeks love, But he who repeats _or_ gossips about a matter separates intimate friends. 















###### 10 







A reprimand goes deeper into one who has understanding _and_ a teachable spirit Than a hundred lashes into a fool. 















###### 11 







A rebellious man seeks only evil; Therefore a cruel messenger will be sent against him. 















###### 12 







Let a man meet a [ferocious] bear robbed of her cubs Rather than the [angry, narcissistic] fool in his folly. 















###### 13 







Whoever returns evil for good, Evil will not depart from his house. 















###### 14 







The beginning of strife is like letting out water [as from a small break in a dam; first it trickles and then it gushes]; Therefore [^a]abandon the quarrel before it breaks out _and_ tempers explode. 















###### 15 







He who justifies the wicked, and he who condemns the righteous Are both repulsive to the LORD. 















###### 16 







Why is there money in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom, When he has no common sense _or_ even a heart for it? 















###### 17 







A friend loves at all times, And a brother is born for adversity. 















###### 18 







A man lacking common sense gives a pledge And becomes guarantor [for the debt of another] in the presence of his neighbor. 















###### 19 







He who loves transgression loves strife _and_ is quarrelsome; He who [proudly] raises his gate seeks destruction [because of his arrogant pride]. 















###### 20 







He who has a crooked mind finds no good, And he who is perverted in his language falls into evil. 















###### 21 







He who becomes the parent of a fool [who is spiritually blind] does so to his sorrow, And the father of a fool [who is spiritually blind] has no joy. 















###### 22 







A happy heart is good medicine _and_ a joyful mind causes healing, But a broken spirit dries up the bones. 















###### 23 







A wicked man receives a bribe from the [hidden] pocket To pervert the ways of justice. 















###### 24 







[Skillful and godly] wisdom is in the presence of a person of understanding [and he recognizes it], But the eyes of a [thickheaded] fool are on the ends of the earth. 















###### 25 







A foolish son is a grief _and_ anguish to his father And bitterness to her who gave birth to him. 















###### 26 







It is also not good to fine the righteous, Nor to strike the noble for their uprightness. 















###### 27 







He who has knowledge restrains _and_ is careful with his words, And a man of understanding _and_ wisdom has a cool spirit (self-control, an even temper). 















###### 28 







Even a [callous, arrogant] fool, when he keeps silent, is considered wise; When he closes his lips he is regarded as sensible (prudent, discreet) _and_ a man of understanding. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

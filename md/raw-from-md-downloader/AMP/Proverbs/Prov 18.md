# Proverbs 18

***
















###### 1 







He who [willfully] separates himself [from God and man] seeks his own desire, He quarrels against all sound wisdom. 















###### 2 







A [closed-minded] fool does not delight in understanding, But only in revealing his personal opinions [unwittingly displaying his self-indulgence and his stupidity]. 















###### 3 







When the wicked man comes [to the depth of evil], contempt [of all that is pure and good] also comes, And with inner baseness (dishonor) comes outer shame (scorn). 















###### 4 







The words of a man's mouth are like deep waters [copious and difficult to fathom]; The fountain of [mature, godly] wisdom is like a bubbling stream [sparkling, fresh, pure, and life-giving]. 















###### 5 







To show respect to the wicked person is not good, Nor to push aside _and_ deprive the righteous of justice. 















###### 6 







A fool's lips bring contention _and_ strife, And his mouth invites a beating. 















###### 7 







A fool's mouth is his ruin, And his lips are the snare of his soul. 















###### 8 







The words of a whisperer (gossip) are like dainty morsels [to be greedily eaten]; They go down into the innermost chambers of the body [to be remembered and mused upon]. 















###### 9 







He who is careless in his work Is a brother to him who destroys. 















###### 10 







The name of the LORD is a strong tower; The righteous runs to it and is safe _and_ set on high [far above evil]. 















###### 11 







The rich man's wealth is his strong city, And like a high wall [of protection] in his own imagination _and_ conceit. 















###### 12 







Before disaster the heart of a man is haughty _and_ filled with self-importance, But humility comes before honor. 















###### 13 







He who answers before he hears [the facts]-- It is folly and shame to him. 















###### 14 







The spirit of a man sustains him in sickness, But as for a broken spirit, who can bear it? 















###### 15 







The mind of the prudent [always] acquires knowledge, And the ear of the wise [always] seeks knowledge. 















###### 16 







A man's gift [given in love or courtesy] makes room for him And brings him before great men. 















###### 17 







The first one to plead his case seems right, _Until_ another comes and cross-examines him. 















###### 18 







[^a]To cast lots puts an end to quarrels And decides between powerful contenders. 















###### 19 







A brother offended _is harder to win_ over than a fortified city, And contentions [separating families] are like the bars of a castle. 















###### 20 







A man's stomach will be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; He will be satisfied with the consequence of his words. 















###### 21 







Death and life are in the power of the tongue, And those who love it _and_ indulge it will eat its fruit _and_ bear the consequences of their words. 















###### 22 







He who finds a [[^b]true and faithful] wife finds a good thing And obtains favor _and_ approval from the LORD. 















###### 23 







The poor man pleads, But the rich man answers roughly. 















###### 24 







The man of _too many_ friends [chosen indiscriminately] will be broken in pieces _and_ come to ruin, But there is a [true, loving] friend who [is reliable and] sticks closer than a brother. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

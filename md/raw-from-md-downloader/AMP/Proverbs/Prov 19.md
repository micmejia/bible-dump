# Proverbs 19

***
















###### 1 







Better is a poor man who walks in his integrity Than a [rich] man who is twisted in his speech and is a [shortsighted] fool. 















###### 2 







Also it is not good for a person to be without knowledge, And he who hurries with his feet [acting impulsively and proceeding without caution or analyzing the consequences] sins (misses the mark). 















###### 3 







The foolishness of man undermines his way [ruining whatever he undertakes]; Then his heart is resentful _and_ rages against the LORD [for, being a fool, he blames the LORD instead of himself]. 















###### 4 







Wealth makes many friends, But a poor man is separated from his friend. 















###### 5 







A false witness will not go unpunished, And he who breathes out lies will not escape. 















###### 6 







Many will seek the favor of a generous _and_ noble man, And everyone is a friend to him who gives gifts. 















###### 7 







All the brothers of a poor man hate him; How much more do his friends abandon him! He pursues _them with_ words, but they are gone. 















###### 8 







He who gains wisdom _and_ good sense loves (preserves) his own soul; He who keeps understanding will find good _and_ prosper. 















###### 9 







A false witness will not go unpunished, And he who breathes lies will perish. 















###### 10 







Luxury is not fitting for a fool; Much less for a slave to rule over princes. 















###### 11 







Good sense _and_ discretion make a man slow to anger, And it is his honor _and_ glory to overlook a transgression _or_ an offense [without seeking revenge and harboring resentment]. 















###### 12 







The king's wrath _terrifies_ like the roaring of a lion, But his favor is as [refreshing and nourishing as] dew on the grass. 















###### 13 







A foolish (ungodly) son is destruction to his father, And the contentions of a [quarrelsome] wife are like a constant dripping [of water]. 















###### 14 







House and wealth are the inheritance from fathers, But a wise, understanding, _and_ sensible wife is [a gift and blessing] from the LORD. 















###### 15 







Laziness casts one into a deep sleep [unmindful of lost opportunity], And the idle person will suffer hunger. 















###### 16 







He who keeps _and_ obeys the commandment [of the LORD] keeps (guards) his own life, But he who is careless of his ways _and_ conduct will die. 















###### 17 







He who is gracious _and_ lends a hand to the poor lends to the LORD, And the LORD will repay him for his good deed. 















###### 18 







Discipline _and_ teach your son while there is hope, And do not [indulge your anger or resentment by imposing inappropriate punishment nor] desire his destruction. 















###### 19 







_A man of_ great anger will bear the penalty [for his quick temper and lack of self-control]; For if you rescue him [and do not let him learn from the consequences of his action], you will only have to rescue him over and over again. 















###### 20 







Listen to counsel, receive instruction, _and_ accept correction, That you may be wise in the time to come. 















###### 21 







Many plans are in a man's mind, But it is the Lord's purpose for him that will stand (be carried out). 















###### 22 







That which is desirable in a man is his loyalty _and_ unfailing love, But it is better to be a poor man than a [wealthy] liar. 















###### 23 







The fear of the LORD _leads_ to life, So that one may sleep satisfied, untouched by evil. 















###### 24 







The lazy man buries his hand in the [food] dish, But will not even bring it to his mouth again. 















###### 25 







Strike a scoffer [for refusing to learn], and the naive may [be warned and] become prudent; Reprimand one who has understanding _and_ a teachable spirit, and he will gain knowledge _and_ insight. 















###### 26 







He who assaults his father and chases away his mother Is a son who brings shame and disgrace. 















###### 27 







Cease listening, my son, to instruction _and_ discipline _And you will_ stray from the words of knowledge. 















###### 28 







A wicked _and_ worthless witness mocks justice, And the mouth of the wicked spreads iniquity. 















###### 29 







Judgments are prepared for scoffers, And beatings for the backs of [thickheaded] fools. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

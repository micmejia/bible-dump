# Proverbs 2

***
















###### 1 







My son, if you will receive my words And treasure my commandments within you, 















###### 2 







So that your ear is attentive to [skillful and godly] wisdom, And apply your heart to understanding [seeking it conscientiously and striving for it eagerly]; 















###### 3 







Yes, if you cry out for insight, And lift up your voice for understanding; 















###### 4 







If you seek skillful _and_ godly wisdom as you would silver And search for her as you would hidden treasures; 















###### 5 







Then you will understand the [reverent] fear of the LORD [that is, worshiping Him and regarding Him as truly awesome] And discover the knowledge of God. 















###### 6 







For the LORD gives [skillful and godly] wisdom; From His mouth come knowledge and understanding. 















###### 7 







He stores away sound wisdom for the righteous [those who are in right standing with Him]; _He is_ a shield to those who walk in integrity [those of honorable character and moral courage], 















###### 8 







He guards the paths of justice; And He preserves the way of His saints (believers). 















###### 9 







Then you will understand righteousness and justice [in every circumstance] And integrity and every good path. 















###### 10 







For [skillful and godly] wisdom will enter your heart And knowledge will be pleasant to your soul. 















###### 11 







Discretion will watch over you, Understanding _and_ discernment will guard you, 















###### 12 







To keep you from the way of evil _and_ the evil man, From the man who speaks perverse things; 















###### 13 







From those who leave the paths of uprightness To walk in the ways of darkness; 















###### 14 







Who find joy in doing evil And delight in the perversity of evil, 















###### 15 







Whose paths are crooked, And who are devious in their ways; 















###### 16 







To keep you from the immoral woman; From the seductress with her flattering words, 















###### 17 







Who leaves the companion (husband) of her youth, And forgets the covenant of her God. 















###### 18 







For her house leads down to death And her paths lead to the dead; 















###### 19 







None who go to her return again, Nor do they regain the paths of life-- 















###### 20 







So you will walk in the way of good men [that is, those of personal integrity, moral courage and honorable character], And keep to the paths of the righteous. 















###### 21 







For the upright [those who are in right standing with God] will live in the land And those [of integrity] who are blameless [in God's sight] will remain in it; 















###### 22 







But the wicked will be cut off from the land And the treacherous shall be [forcibly] uprooted _and_ removed from it. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Proverbs 20

***
















###### 1 







Wine is a mocker, strong drink a riotous brawler; And whoever is intoxicated by it is not wise. 















###### 2 







The terror of a king is like the roaring of a lion; Whoever provokes him to anger forfeits his own life. 















###### 3 







It is an honor for a man to keep away from strife [by handling situations with thoughtful foresight], But any fool will [start a] quarrel [without regard for the consequences]. 















###### 4 







The lazy man does not plow when the winter [planting] season arrives; So he begs at the [next] harvest and has nothing [to reap]. 















###### 5 







A plan (motive, wise counsel) in the heart of a man is like water in a deep well, But a man of understanding draws it out. 















###### 6 







Many a man proclaims his own loyalty _and_ goodness, But who can find a faithful _and_ trustworthy man? 















###### 7 







The righteous man who walks in integrity _and_ lives life in accord with his [godly] beliefs-- How blessed [happy and spiritually secure] are his children after him [who have his example to follow]. 















###### 8 







A [discerning] king who sits on the throne of judgment Sifts all evil [like chaff] with his eyes [and cannot be easily fooled]. 















###### 9 







Who can say, "I have cleansed my heart, I am pure from my sin?" 















###### 10 







Differing weights [one for buying and another for selling] and differing measures, Both of them are detestable _and_ offensive to the LORD. 















###### 11 







Even a boy is known _and_ distinguished by his acts, Whether his conduct is pure and right. 















###### 12 







The hearing ear and the seeing eye, The [omnipotent] LORD has made both of them. 















###### 13 







Do not love [excessive] sleep, or you will become poor; Open your eyes [so that you can do your work] and you will be satisfied with bread. 















###### 14 







"It is [almost] worthless, it is [almost] worthless," says the buyer [as he negotiates the price]; But when he goes his way, then he boasts [about his bargain]. 















###### 15 







There is gold, and an abundance of pearls, But the lips of knowledge are a vessel of preciousness [the most precious of all]. 















###### 16 







[The judge tells the creditor], "Take the clothes of one who is surety for a stranger; And hold him in pledge [when he guarantees a loan] for foreigners." 















###### 17 







Food gained by deceit is sweet to a man, But afterward his mouth will be filled with gravel [just as sin may be sweet at first, but later its consequences bring despair]. 















###### 18 







Plans are established by counsel; So make war [only] with wise guidance. 















###### 19 







He who goes about as a gossip reveals secrets; Therefore do not associate with a gossip [who talks freely or flatters]. 















###### 20 







Whoever curses his father or his mother, His lamp [of life] will be extinguished in time of darkness. 















###### 21 







An inheritance hastily gained [by greedy, unjust means] at the beginning Will not be blessed in the end. 















###### 22 







Do not say, "I will repay evil"; Wait [expectantly] for the LORD, and He will rescue _and_ save you. 















###### 23 







Differing weights are detestable _and_ offensive to the LORD, And fraudulent scales are not good. 















###### 24 







Man's steps are ordered _and_ ordained by the LORD. How then can a man [fully] understand his way? 















###### 25 







It is a trap for a man to [[^a]speak a vow of consecration and] say rashly, "It is holy!" And [not until] afterward consider [whether he can fulfill it]. 















###### 26 







A wise king sifts out the wicked [from among the good] And drives the [threshing] wheel over them [to separate the chaff from the grain]. 















###### 27 







The [^b]spirit (conscience) of man is the lamp of the LORD, Searching _and_ examining all the innermost parts of his being. 















###### 28 







Loyalty _and_ mercy, truth _and_ faithfulness, protect the king, And he upholds his throne by lovingkindness. 















###### 29 







The glory of young men is their [physical] strength, And the honor of aged men is their gray head [representing wisdom and experience]. 















###### 30 







Blows that wound cleanse away evil, And strokes reach to the innermost parts. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

The classic example of a careless vow was Jephthahâ€™s promise to sacrifice to the Lord whatever came out of his house to meet him on his return from a successful battle (Judg 11:30-35). [^b]: Proverbs 20:27 Lit _breath_.

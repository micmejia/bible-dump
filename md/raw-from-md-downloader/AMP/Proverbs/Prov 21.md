# Proverbs 21

***
















###### 1 







The king's heart is like channels of water in the hand of the LORD; He turns it whichever way He wishes. 















###### 2 







Every man's way is right in his own eyes, But the LORD weighs _and_ examines the hearts [of people and their motives]. 















###### 3 







To do righteousness and justice Is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice [for wrongs repeatedly committed]. 















###### 4 







Haughty _and_ arrogant eyes and a proud heart, The lamp of the wicked [their self-centered pride], is sin [in the eyes of God]. 















###### 5 







The plans of the diligent lead surely to abundance _and_ advantage, But everyone who acts in haste comes surely to poverty. 















###### 6 







Acquiring treasures by a lying tongue Is a fleeting vapor, the seeking _and_ pursuit of death. 















###### 7 







The violence of the wicked will [return to them and] drag them away [like fish caught in a net], Because they refuse to act with justice. 















###### 8 







The way of the guilty is [exceedingly] crooked, But as for the pure, his conduct is upright. 















###### 9 







It is better to live in a corner of the housetop [on the flat roof, exposed to the weather] Than in a house shared with a quarrelsome (contentious) woman. 















###### 10 







The soul of the wicked desires evil [like an addictive substance]; His neighbor finds no compassion in his eyes. 















###### 11 







When the scoffer is punished, the naive [observes the lesson and] becomes wise; But when the wise _and_ teachable person is instructed, he receives knowledge. 















###### 12 







The righteous one keeps an eye on the house of the wicked-- How the wicked are cast down to ruin. 















###### 13 







Whoever shuts his ears at the cry of the poor Will cry out himself and not be answered. 















###### 14 







A gift in secret subdues anger, And a bribe [hidden] in the pocket, strong wrath. 















###### 15 







When justice is done, it is a joy to the righteous (the upright, the one in right standing with God), But to the evildoers it is disaster. 















###### 16 







A man who wanders from the way of understanding (godly wisdom) Will remain in the assembly of the dead. 















###### 17 







He who loves [only selfish] pleasure _will become_ a poor man; He who loves _and_ is devoted to [^a]wine and [olive] oil will not become rich. 















###### 18 







The wicked become a ransom for the righteous, And the treacherous in the place of the upright [for they fall into their own traps]. 















###### 19 







It is better to dwell in a desert land Than with a contentious and troublesome woman. 















###### 20 







There is precious treasure and oil in the house of the wise [who prepare for the future], But a short-sighted _and_ foolish man swallows it up _and_ wastes it. 















###### 21 







He who earnestly seeks righteousness and loyalty Finds life, righteousness, and honor. 















###### 22 







A wise man scales the city [walls] of the mighty And brings down the stronghold in which they trust. 















###### 23 







He who guards his mouth and his tongue Guards himself from troubles. 















###### 24 







"Proud," "Haughty," "Scoffer," are his names Who acts with overbearing _and_ insolent pride. 















###### 25 







The desire of the lazy kills him, For his hands refuse to labor; 















###### 26 







He craves all the day long [and does no work], But the righteous [willingly] gives and does not withhold [what he has]. 















###### 27 







The sacrifice of the wicked is detestable _and_ offensive [to the LORD]. How much more [unacceptable and insulting can it be] when he brings it with evil intention? 















###### 28 







A false witness will perish, But a man who listens _to the truth_ will speak forever _and_ go unchallenged. 















###### 29 







A wicked man puts on a bold face, But as for the upright, he considers, directs, _and_ establishes his way [with the confidence of integrity]. 















###### 30 







There is no [human] wisdom or understanding Or counsel [that can prevail] against the LORD. 















###### 31 







The horse is prepared for the day of battle, But deliverance _and_ victory belong to the LORD. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Proverbs 22

***
















###### 1 







A _good_ name [earned by honorable behavior, godly wisdom, moral courage, and personal integrity] is more desirable than great riches; And favor is better than silver and gold. 















###### 2 







The rich and poor have a common bond; The LORD is the Maker of them all. 















###### 3 







A prudent _and_ far-sighted _person_ sees the evil [of sin] and hides himself [from it], But the naive continue on and are punished [by suffering the consequences of sin]. 















###### 4 







The reward of humility [that is, having a realistic view of one's importance] and the [reverent, worshipful] fear of the LORD Is riches, honor, and life. 















###### 5 







Thorns and snares are in the way of the obstinate [for their lack of honor and their wrong-doing traps them]; He who guards himself [with godly wisdom] will be far from them _and_ avoid the consequences they suffer. 















###### 6 







Train up a child in the way he should go [teaching him to seek God's wisdom and will for his abilities and talents], Even when he is old he will not depart from it. 















###### 7 







The rich rules over the poor, And the borrower is servant to the lender. 















###### 8 







He who sows injustice will reap [a harvest of] trouble, And the rod of his wrath [with which he oppresses others] will fail. 















###### 9 







He who is generous will be blessed, For he gives some of his food to the poor. 















###### 10 







Drive out the scoffer, and contention will go away; Even strife and dishonor will cease. 















###### 11 







He who loves purity of heart And whose speech is gracious will have the king as his friend. 















###### 12 







The eyes of the LORD keep guard over knowledge _and_ the one who has it, But He overthrows the words of the treacherous. 















###### 13 







The lazy one [manufactures excuses and] says, "There is a lion outside! I will be killed in the streets [if I go out to work]!" 















###### 14 







The mouth of an immoral woman is a deep pit [deep and inescapable]; He who is cursed by the LORD [because of his adulterous sin] will fall into it. 















###### 15 







Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child; The rod of discipline [correction administered with godly wisdom and lovingkindness] will remove it far from him. 















###### 16 







He who oppresses _or_ exploits the poor to get more for himself Or who gives to the rich [to gain influence and favor], will only come to poverty. 















###### 17 







Listen carefully and hear the [^a]words of the wise, And apply your mind to my knowledge; 















###### 18 







For it will be pleasant if you keep them in mind [incorporating them as guiding principles]; Let them be ready on your lips [to guide and strengthen yourself and others]. 















###### 19 







So that your trust _and_ reliance _and_ confidence may be in the LORD, I have taught these things to you today, even to you. 















###### 20 







Have I not written to you excellent things In counsels and knowledge, 















###### 21 







To let you know the certainty of the words of truth, That you may give a correct answer to him who sent you? 















###### 22 







Do not rob the poor because he is poor [and defenseless], Nor crush the afflicted [by legal proceedings] at the gate [where the city court is held], 















###### 23 







For the LORD will plead their case And take the life of those who rob them. 















###### 24 







Do not even associate with a man given to angry outbursts; Or go [along] with a hot-tempered man, 















###### 25 







Or you will learn his [undisciplined] ways And get yourself trapped [in a situation from which it is hard to escape]. 















###### 26 







Do not be among those who give pledges [involving themselves in others' finances], Or among those who become guarantors for _others_' debts. 















###### 27 







If you have nothing with which to pay [another's debt when he defaults], Why should his creditor take your bed from under you? 















###### 28 







Do not move the ancient landmark [at the boundary of the property] Which your fathers have set. 















###### 29 







Do you see a man skillful _and_ experienced in his work? He will stand [in honor] before kings; He will not stand before obscure men. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

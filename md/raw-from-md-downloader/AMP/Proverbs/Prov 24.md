# Proverbs 24

***
















###### 1 







Do not be envious of evil men, Nor desire to be with them; 















###### 2 







For their minds plot violence, And their lips talk of trouble [for the innocent]. 















###### 3 







Through [skillful and godly] wisdom a house [a life, a home, a family] is built, And by understanding it is established [on a sound and good foundation], 















###### 4 







And by knowledge its rooms are filled With all precious and pleasant riches. 















###### 5 







A wise man is strong, And a man of knowledge strengthens his power; 















###### 6 







For by wise guidance you can wage your war, And in an abundance of [wise] counselors there is victory _and_ safety. 















###### 7 







Wisdom is too exalted for a [hardened, arrogant] [^a]fool; He does not open his mouth in the gate [where the city's rulers sit in judgment]. 















###### 8 







He who plans to do evil Will be called a schemer _or_ deviser of evil. 















###### 9 







The devising of folly is sin, And the scoffer is repulsive to men. 















###### 10 







If you are slack (careless) in the day of distress, Your strength is limited. 















###### 11 







Rescue those who are being taken away to death, And those who stagger to the slaughter, Oh hold them back [from their doom]! 















###### 12 







If you [claim ignorance and] say, "See, we did not know this," Does He not consider it who weighs _and_ examines the hearts _and_ their motives? And does He not know it who guards your life _and_ keeps your soul? And will He not repay [you and] every man according to his works? 















###### 13 







My son, eat honey, because it is good, And the drippings of the honeycomb are sweet to your taste. 















###### 14 







Know that [skillful and godly] wisdom is [so very good] for your life _and_ soul; If you find wisdom, then there will be a future _and_ a reward, And your hope _and_ expectation will not be cut off. 















###### 15 







Do not lie in wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous; Do not destroy his resting place; 















###### 16 







For a righteous man falls seven times, and rises again, But the wicked stumble in _time of_ disaster _and_ collapse. 















###### 17 







Do not rejoice _and_ gloat when your enemy falls, And do not let your heart be glad [in self-righteousness] when he stumbles, 















###### 18 







Or the LORD will see your gloating and be displeased, And turn His anger away from your enemy. 















###### 19 







Do not get upset because of evildoers, Or be envious of the wicked, 















###### 20 







For there will be no future for the evil man; The lamp of the wicked will be put out. 















###### 21 







My son, fear the LORD and the king; And do not associate with those who are given to change [of allegiance, and are revolutionary], 















###### 22 







For their tragedy will rise suddenly, And who knows the punishment that both [the LORD and the king] will bring on the rebellious? 















###### 23 







These also are sayings of the wise: To show partiality in judgment is not good. 















###### 24 







He who says to the wicked, "You are righteous," Peoples will curse him, nations will denounce him; 















###### 25 







But to those [honorable judges] who rebuke the _wicked_, it will go well with them _and_ they will find delight, And a good blessing will come upon them. 















###### 26 







He kisses the lips [and wins the hearts of people] Who gives a right _and_ straightforward answer. 















###### 27 







Prepare your work outside And get it ready for yourself in the field; [^b]Afterward build your house _and_ establish a home. 















###### 28 







Do not be a witness against your [^c]neighbor without cause, And do not deceive with your lips [speak neither lies nor half-truths]. 















###### 29 







Do not say, "I will do to him as he has done to me; I will pay the man back for his deed." 















###### 30 







I went by the field of the lazy man, And by the vineyard of the man lacking understanding _and_ common sense; 















###### 31 







And, behold, it was all overgrown with thorns, And nettles were covering its surface, And its stone wall was broken down. 















###### 32 







When I saw, I considered it well; I looked and received instruction. 















###### 33 







"Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, A little folding of the hands to rest [and daydream]," 















###### 34 







Then your poverty will come as a robber, And your want like an armed man. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

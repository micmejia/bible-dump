# Proverbs 26

***
















###### 1 







Like snow in summer and like rain in harvest, So honor is not fitting for a [shortsighted] [^a]fool. 















###### 2 







Like the sparrow in her wandering, like the swallow in her flying, So the curse without cause does not come _and_ alight [on the undeserving]. 















###### 3 







A whip for the horse, a bridle for the donkey, And a rod for the backs of fools [who refuse to learn]. 















###### 4 







Do not answer [nor pretend to agree with the frivolous comments of] a [closed-minded] fool according to his folly, Otherwise you, even you, will be like him. 















###### 5 







Answer [and correct the erroneous concepts of] a fool according to his folly, Otherwise he will be wise in his own eyes [if he thinks you agree with him]. 















###### 6 







He who sends a message by the hand of a fool Cuts off _his own_ feet (sabotages himself) and drinks the violence [it brings on himself as a consequence]. 















###### 7 







Like the legs which are useless to the lame, So is a proverb in the mouth of a fool [who cannot learn from its wisdom]. 















###### 8 







Like one who [absurdly] binds a stone in a sling [making it impossible to throw], So is he who [absurdly] gives honor to a fool. 















###### 9 







Like a thorn that goes [without being felt] into the hand of a drunken man, So is a proverb in the mouth of a fool [who remains unaffected by its wisdom]. 















###### 10 







Like a [careless] archer who [shoots arrows wildly and] wounds everyone, So is he who hires a fool or those who [by chance just] pass by. 















###### 11 







Like a dog that returns to his vomit Is a fool who repeats his foolishness. 















###### 12 







Do you see a man [who is unteachable and] wise in his own eyes _and_ full of self-conceit? There is more hope for a fool than for him. 















###### 13 







The lazy person [who is self-indulgent and relies on lame excuses] says, "There is a lion in the road! A lion is in the open square [and if I go outside to work I will be killed]!" 















###### 14 







As the door turns on its hinges, So does the lazy person on his bed [never getting out of it]. 















###### 15 







The lazy person buries his hand in the dish [losing opportunity after opportunity]; It wearies him to bring it back to his mouth. 















###### 16 







The lazy person is wiser in his own eyes Than seven [sensible] men who can give a discreet answer. 















###### 17 







Like one who grabs a dog by the ears [and is likely to be bitten] Is he who, passing by, stops to meddle with a dispute that is none of his business. 















###### 18 







Like a madman who throws Firebrands, arrows, and death, 















###### 19 







So is the man who deceives his neighbor (acquaintance, friend) And then says, "Was I not joking?" 















###### 20 







For lack of wood the fire goes out, And where there is no whisperer [who gossips], contention quiets down. 















###### 21 







Like charcoal to hot embers and wood to fire, So is a contentious man to kindle strife. 















###### 22 







The words of a whisperer (gossip) are like dainty morsels [to be greedily eaten]; They go down into the innermost chambers of the body [to be remembered and mused upon]. 















###### 23 







Like a [common] clay vessel covered with the silver dross [making it appear silver when it has no real value] Are burning lips [murmuring manipulative words] and a wicked heart. 















###### 24 







He who hates, disguises it with his lips, But he stores up deceit in his heart. 















###### 25 







When he speaks graciously _and_ kindly [to conceal his malice], do not trust him, For seven abominations are in his heart. 















###### 26 







_Though his_ hatred covers itself with guile _and_ deceit, His malevolence will be revealed openly before the assembly. 















###### 27 







Whoever digs a pit [for another man's feet] will fall into it, And he who rolls a stone [up a hill to do mischief], it will come back on him. 















###### 28 







A lying tongue hates those it wounds _and_ crushes, And a flattering mouth works ruin. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

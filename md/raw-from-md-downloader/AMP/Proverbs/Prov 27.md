# Proverbs 27

***
















###### 1 







Do not boast about tomorrow, For you do not know what a day may bring. 















###### 2 







Let another praise you, and not your own mouth; A stranger, and not your own lips. 















###### 3 







Stone is heavy and the sand weighty, But a fool's [unreasonable] wrath is heavier _and_ more burdensome than both of them. 















###### 4 







Wrath is cruel and anger is an overwhelming flood, But who is able to endure _and_ stand before [the sin of] jealousy? 















###### 5 







Better is an open reprimand [of loving correction] Than love that is hidden. 















###### 6 







Faithful are the wounds of a friend [who corrects out of love and concern], But the kisses of an enemy are deceitful [because they serve his hidden agenda]. 















###### 7 







He who is satisfied loathes honey, But to the hungry soul any bitter thing is sweet. 















###### 8 







Like a bird that wanders from her nest [with its comfort and safety], So is a man who wanders from his home. 















###### 9 







Oil and perfume make the heart glad; So does the sweetness of a friend's counsel that comes from the heart. 















###### 10 







Do not abandon your own friend and your father's friend, And do not go to your brother's house in the day of your disaster. Better is a neighbor who is near than a brother who is far away. 















###### 11 







My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, That I may reply to him who reproaches (reprimands, criticizes) me. 















###### 12 







A prudent man sees evil and hides himself _and_ avoids it, But the naive [who are easily misled] continue on and are punished [by suffering the consequences of sin]. 















###### 13 







[The judge tells the creditor,] "Take the garment of one who is surety (guarantees a loan) for a stranger; And hold him in pledge when he is surety for an immoral woman [for it is unlikely the debt will be repaid]." 















###### 14 







He who blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the morning, It will be counted as a curse to him [for it will either be annoying or his purpose will be suspect]. 















###### 15 







A constant dripping on a day of steady rain And a contentious (quarrelsome) woman are alike; 















###### 16 







Whoever attempts to restrain her [criticism] might as well try to stop the wind, And grasps oil with his right hand. 















###### 17 







As iron sharpens iron, So one man sharpens [and influences] another [through discussion]. 















###### 18 







He who tends the fig tree will eat its fruit, And he who faithfully protects _and_ cares for his master will be honored. 















###### 19 







As in water face _reflects_ face, So the heart of man reflects man. 















###### 20 







Sheol (the place of the dead) and Abaddon (the underworld) are never satisfied; Nor are the eyes of man ever satisfied. 















###### 21 







The refining pot is for silver and the furnace for gold [to separate the impurities of the metal], And each is tested by the praise given to him [and his response to it, whether humble or proud]. 















###### 22 







Even though you pound a [hardened, arrogant] fool [who rejects wisdom] in a mortar with a pestle like grain, Yet his foolishness will not leave him. 















###### 23 







Be diligent to know the condition of your flocks, And pay attention to your herds; 















###### 24 







For riches are not forever, Nor does a crown _endure_ to all generations. 















###### 25 







When the grass is gone, the new growth is seen, And herbs of the mountain are gathered in, 















###### 26 







The lambs will _supply wool_ for your clothing, And the goats will bring the price of a field. 















###### 27 







And _there will be_ enough goats' milk for your food, For the food of your household, And for the maintenance of your maids. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

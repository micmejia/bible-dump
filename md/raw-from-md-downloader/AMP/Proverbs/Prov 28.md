# Proverbs 28

***
















###### 1 







The wicked flee when no one pursues them, But the righteous are as bold as a lion. 















###### 2 







When a land does wrong, it has many princes, But when the ruler is a man of understanding and knowledge, its stability endures. 















###### 3 







A poor man who oppresses _and_ exploits the lowly Is like a sweeping rain which leaves no food. 















###### 4 







Those who [^a]set aside the law [of God and man] praise the wicked, But those who keep the law [of God and man] struggle with them. 















###### 5 







Evil men do not understand justice, But they who long for _and_ seek the LORD understand it fully. 















###### 6 







Better is the poor who walks in his integrity Than he who is crooked _and_ two-faced though he is rich. 















###### 7 







He who keeps the law [of God and man] is a wise _and_ discerning son, But he who is a companion of gluttons humiliates his father [and himself]. 















###### 8 







He who increases his wealth by interest and usury (excessive interest) Gathers it for him who is gracious to the poor. 















###### 9 







He who turns his ear away from listening to the law [of God and man], Even his prayer is repulsive [to God]. 















###### 10 







He who leads the upright astray on an evil path Will himself fall into his own pit, But the blameless will inherit good. 















###### 11 







The rich man [who is conceited and relies on his wealth instead of God] is wise in his own eyes, But the poor man who has understanding [because he relies on God] is able to see through him. 















###### 12 







When the righteous triumph, there is great glory _and_ celebration; But when the wicked rise [to prominence], men hide themselves. 















###### 13 







He who conceals his transgressions will not prosper, But whoever confesses and [^b]turns away from his sins will find compassion _and_ mercy. 















###### 14 







Blessed _and_ favored by God is the man who fears [sin and its consequence] at all times, But he who hardens his heart [and is determined to sin] will fall into disaster. 















###### 15 







Like a roaring lion and a charging bear Is a wicked ruler over a poor people. 















###### 16 







A leader who is a great oppressor lacks understanding _and_ common sense [and his wickedness shortens his days], But he who hates unjust gain will [be blessed and] prolong his days. 















###### 17 







A man who is burdened with the guilt of human blood (murder) Will be a fugitive until death; let no one support him _or_ give him refuge. 















###### 18 







He who walks blamelessly _and_ uprightly will be kept safe, But he who is crooked (perverse) will suddenly fall. 















###### 19 







He who cultivates his land will have plenty of bread, But he who follows worthless people _and_ frivolous pursuits will have plenty of poverty. 















###### 20 







A faithful (right-minded) man will abound with blessings, But he who hurries to be rich will not go unpunished. 















###### 21 







To have regard for one person over another _and_ to show favoritism is not good, Because for a piece of bread a man will transgress. 















###### 22 







He who has an evil _and_ envious eye hurries to be rich And does not know that poverty will come upon him. 















###### 23 







He who [appropriately] reprimands a [wise] man will afterward find more favor Than he who flatters with the tongue. 















###### 24 







He who robs his father or his mother And says, "This is no sin," Is [not only a thief but also] the companion of a man who destroys. 















###### 25 







An arrogant _and_ greedy man stirs up strife, But he who trusts in the LORD will be blessed _and_ prosper. 















###### 26 







He who trusts confidently in his own heart is a [dull, thickheaded] fool, But he who walks in [skillful and godly] wisdom will be rescued. 















###### 27 







He who gives to the poor will never want, But he who shuts his eyes [from their need] will have many curses. 















###### 28 







When the wicked rise [to power], men hide themselves; But when the wicked perish, the [consistently] righteous increase _and_ become great. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

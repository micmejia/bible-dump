# Proverbs 29

***
















###### 1 







He who hardens his neck _and_ refuses instruction after being often reproved (corrected, criticized), Will suddenly be broken beyond repair. 















###### 2 







When the righteous are in authority _and_ become great, the people rejoice; But when the wicked man rules, the people groan _and_ sigh. 















###### 3 







A man who loves [skillful and godly] wisdom makes his father joyful, But he who associates with prostitutes wastes his wealth. 















###### 4 







The king establishes (stabilizes) the land by justice, But a man who takes bribes overthrows it. 















###### 5 







A man who flatters his neighbor [with smooth words intending to do harm] Is spreading a net for his own feet. 















###### 6 







By his wicked plan an evil man is trapped, But the righteous man sings and rejoices [for his plan brings good things to him]. 















###### 7 







The righteous man cares for the rights of the poor, But the wicked man has no interest in such knowledge. 















###### 8 







Scoffers set a city afire [by stirring up trouble], But wise men turn away anger [and restore order with their good judgment]. 















###### 9 







If a wise man has a controversy with a foolish _and_ arrogant man, The foolish man [ignores logic and fairness and] only rages or laughs, and there is no peace (rest, agreement). 















###### 10 







The bloodthirsty hate the blameless [because of his integrity], But the upright are concerned for his life. 















###### 11 







A [shortsighted] fool always loses his temper _and_ displays his anger, But a wise man [uses self-control and] holds it back. 















###### 12 







If a ruler pays attention to lies [and encourages corruption], All his officials _will become_ wicked. 















###### 13 







The poor man and the oppressor have this in common: The LORD gives light to the eyes of both. 















###### 14 







If a king faithfully _and_ truthfully judges the poor, His throne shall be established forever. 















###### 15 







The rod and reproof (godly instruction) give wisdom, But a child who gets his own way brings shame to his mother. 















###### 16 







When the wicked are in authority, transgression increases, But the righteous will see the downfall of the wicked. 















###### 17 







Correct your son, and he will give you comfort; Yes, he will delight your soul. 















###### 18 







Where there is no vision [no revelation of God and His word], the people are unrestrained; But happy _and_ blessed is he who keeps the law [of God]. 















###### 19 







A servant will not be corrected by words _alone_; For though he understands, he will not respond [nor pay attention]. 















###### 20 







Do you see a [conceited] man who speaks quickly [offering his opinions or answering without thinking]? There is more hope for a [thickheaded] [^a]fool than for him. 















###### 21 







He who pampers his slave from childhood Will find him to be a son in the end. 















###### 22 







An angry man stirs up strife, And a hot-tempered _and_ undisciplined man commits many transgressions. 















###### 23 







A man's pride _and_ sense of self-importance will bring him down, But he who has a humble spirit will obtain honor. 















###### 24 







Whoever is partner with a thief hates his own life; He hears the curse [when swearing an oath to testify], but discloses nothing [and commits perjury by omission]. 















###### 25 







The fear of man brings a snare, But whoever trusts in _and_ puts his confidence in the LORD will be exalted _and_ safe. 















###### 26 







Many seek the ruler's favor, But justice for man comes from the LORD. 















###### 27 







An unjust man is repulsive to the righteous, And he who is upright in the way [of the LORD] is repulsive to the wicked. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Proverbs 31

***
















###### 1 







The words of [^a]King Lemuel, the oracle, which his mother taught him: 















###### 2 







What, O my [^b]son? And what, O son of my womb? And what [shall I advise you], O son of my vows? 















###### 3 







Do not give your [generative] strength to women [neither foreign wives in marriages of alliances, nor [^c]concubines], Nor your ways to that which destroys kings. 















###### 4 







It is not for kings, O Lemuel, It is not for kings to drink wine, Or for rulers to desire strong drink, 















###### 5 







Otherwise they drink and forget the law _and_ its decrees, And pervert the rights _and_ justice of all the afflicted. 















###### 6 







Give strong drink [as medicine] to him who is ready to pass away, And wine to him whose life is bitter. 















###### 7 







Let him drink and forget his poverty And no longer remember his trouble. 















###### 8 







Open your mouth for the mute, For the rights of all who are unfortunate _and_ defenseless; 















###### 9 







Open your mouth, judge righteously, And administer justice for the afflicted and needy. ## Description of a Worthy Woman 















###### 10 







[^d]An excellent woman [one who is spiritual, capable, intelligent, and virtuous], who is he who can find her? Her value is more precious than jewels _and_ her worth is far above rubies _or_ pearls. 















###### 11 







The heart of her husband trusts in her [with secure confidence], And he will have no lack of gain. 















###### 12 







She comforts, encourages, _and_ does him only good and not evil All the days of her life. 















###### 13 







She looks for wool and flax And works with willing hands in delight. 















###### 14 







She is like the merchant ships [abounding with treasure]; She brings her [household's] food from far away. 















###### 15 







She rises also while it is still night And gives food to her household And assigns tasks to her maids. 















###### 16 







She considers a field before she buys _or_ accepts it [expanding her business prudently]; With her profits she plants fruitful vines in her vineyard. 















###### 17 







She equips herself with strength [spiritual, mental, and physical fitness for her God-given task] And makes her arms strong. 















###### 18 







She sees that her gain is good; Her lamp does not go out, but it burns continually through the night [she is prepared for whatever lies ahead]. 















###### 19 







She stretches out her hands to the [^e]distaff, And her hands hold the spindle [as she spins wool into thread for clothing]. 















###### 20 







She opens _and_ extends her hand to the poor, And she reaches out her filled hands to the needy. 















###### 21 







She does not fear the snow for her household, For all in her household are clothed in [expensive] scarlet [wool]. 















###### 22 







She makes for herself coverlets, cushions, _and_ rugs of tapestry. Her clothing is linen, pure _and_ fine, and purple [wool]. 















###### 23 







Her husband is known in the [city's] gates, When he sits among the elders of the land. 















###### 24 







She makes [fine] linen garments and sells them; And supplies sashes to the merchants. 















###### 25 







Strength and dignity are her clothing _and_ her position is strong and secure; And she smiles at the future [knowing that she and her family are prepared]. 















###### 26 







She opens her mouth in [skillful and godly] wisdom, And the teaching of kindness is on her tongue [giving counsel and instruction]. 















###### 27 







She looks well to how things go in her household, And does not eat the bread of idleness. 















###### 28 







Her children rise up and call her blessed (happy, prosperous, to be admired); Her husband also, and he praises her, _saying_, 















###### 29 







"Many daughters have done nobly, _and_ well [with the strength of character that is steadfast in goodness], [^f]But you excel them all." 















###### 30 







Charm _and_ grace are deceptive, and [superficial] beauty is vain, But a woman who fears the LORD [reverently worshiping, obeying, serving, and trusting Him with awe-filled respect], she shall be praised. 















###### 31 







Give her of the product of her hands, And let her own works praise her in the gates [of the city]. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: Proverbs 31:2 This chapter consists of two poetic sections. The first (vv 2-9) details the qualities needed to be a wise ruler, and the second (vv 10-31) the qualities describing an excellent wife. [^c]: Proverbs 31:3 See note Gen 22:24. [^d]: Proverbs 31:10 The following verses are written as an acrostic poem (each of the twenty-two verses begins with a successive letter of the Hebrew alphabet).

[^f]: Proverbs 31:29 The source of this remarkable womanâ€™s success and competence is revealed in v 30, and it is a source available to everyone.

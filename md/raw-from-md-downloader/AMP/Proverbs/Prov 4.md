# Proverbs 4

***
















###### 1 







Hear, O children, the instruction of a father, And pay attention [and be willing to learn] so that you may gain understanding _and_ intelligent discernment. 















###### 2 







For I give you good doctrine; Do not [^a]turn away from my instruction. 















###### 3 







When I was a son with my father (David), Tender and the only son in the sight of my mother (Bathsheba), 















###### 4 







He taught me and said to me, "Let your heart hold fast my words; Keep my commandments and live. 















###### 5 







"Get [skillful and godly] wisdom! Acquire understanding [actively seek spiritual discernment, mature comprehension, and logical interpretation]! Do not forget nor turn away from the words of my mouth. 















###### 6 







"Do not [^b]turn away from her (Wisdom) and she will guard _and_ protect you; Love her, and she will watch over you. 















###### 7 







"The beginning of wisdom is: Get [skillful and godly] wisdom [it is preeminent]! And with all your acquiring, get understanding [actively seek spiritual discernment, mature comprehension, and logical interpretation]. 















###### 8 







"Prize wisdom [and exalt her], and she will exalt you; She will honor you if you embrace her. 















###### 9 







"She will place on your head a garland of grace; She will present you with a crown of beauty _and_ glory." 















###### 10 







Hear, my son, and accept my sayings, And the years of your life will be many. 















###### 11 







I have instructed you in the way of [skillful and godly] wisdom; I have led you in upright paths. 















###### 12 







When you walk, your steps will not be impeded [for your path will be clear and open]; And when you run, you will not stumble. 















###### 13 







Take hold of instruction; [actively seek it, grip it firmly and] do not let go. Guard her, for she is your life. 















###### 14 







Do not enter the path of the wicked, And do not go the way of evil men. 















###### 15 







Avoid it, do not travel on it; Turn away from it and pass on. 















###### 16 







For the wicked cannot sleep unless they do evil; And they are deprived of sleep unless they make someone stumble _and_ fall. 















###### 17 







For they eat the bread of wickedness And drink the wine of violence. 















###### 18 







But the path of the just (righteous) is like the light of dawn, That shines brighter and brighter until [it reaches its full strength and glory in] the perfect day. 















###### 19 







The way of the wicked is like [deep] darkness; They do not know over what they stumble. 















###### 20 







My son, pay attention to my words _and_ be willing to learn; Open your ears to my sayings. 















###### 21 







Do not let them escape from your sight; Keep them in the center of your heart. 















###### 22 







For they are life to those who find them, And healing _and_ health to all their flesh. 















###### 23 







Watch over your heart with all diligence, For from it _flow_ the springs of life. 















###### 24 







Put away from you a deceitful (lying, misleading) mouth, And put devious lips far from you. 















###### 25 







Let your eyes look directly ahead [toward the path of moral courage] And let your gaze be fixed straight in front of you [toward the path of integrity]. 















###### 26 







Consider well _and_ watch carefully the path of your feet, And all your ways will be steadfast _and_ sure. 















###### 27 







Do not turn away to the right nor to the left [where evil may lurk]; Turn your foot from [the path of] evil. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

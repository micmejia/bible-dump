# Proverbs 5

***
















###### 1 







My son, be attentive to my wisdom [godly wisdom learned by costly experience], Incline your ear to my understanding; 















###### 2 







That you may exercise discrimination _and_ discretion (good judgment), And your lips may reserve knowledge _and_ answer wisely [to temptation]. 















###### 3 







For the lips of an immoral woman drip honey [like a honeycomb] And her speech is smoother than oil; 















###### 4 







But in the end she is bitter like [the extract of] wormwood, Sharp as a two-edged sword. 















###### 5 







Her feet go down to death; Her steps take hold of Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead), 















###### 6 







So that she does not think [seriously] about the path of life; Her ways are aimless _and_ unstable; you cannot know where her path leads. 















###### 7 







Now then, my sons, listen to me And do not depart from (forget) the words of my mouth. 















###### 8 







Let your way [in life] be far from her, And do not go near the door of her house [avoid even being near the places of temptation], 















###### 9 







Or you will give your honor to others, And your years to the cruel one, 















###### 10 







And strangers will be filled with your strength And your hard-earned wealth will go to the house of a foreigner [who does not know God]; 















###### 11 







And you will groan when your _life is_ ending, When your flesh and your body are consumed; 















###### 12 







And you say, "How I hated instruction _and_ discipline, And my heart despised correction _and_ reproof! 















###### 13 







"I have not listened to the voice of my teachers, Nor have I inclined my ear to those who instructed me. 















###### 14 







"I was almost in total ruin In the midst of the assembly and congregation." 















###### 15 







[^a]Drink water from your own [^b]cistern [of a pure marriage relationship] And fresh running water from your own well. 















###### 16 







Should your [^c]springs (children) be dispersed, As streams of water in the streets? 















###### 17 







[Confine yourself to your own wife.] Let _your children_ be yours alone, And not _the children_ of strangers with you. 















###### 18 







Let your fountain (wife) be blessed [with the rewards of fidelity], And rejoice in the wife of your youth. 















###### 19 







_Let her be as_ a loving hind and graceful doe, Let her breasts refresh _and_ satisfy you at all times; Always be [^d]exhilarated _and_ delight in her love. 















###### 20 







Why should you, my son, be exhilarated with an immoral woman And embrace the bosom of an outsider (pagan)? 















###### 21 







For the ways of man are directly before the eyes of the LORD, And He carefully watches all of his paths [all of his comings and goings]. 















###### 22 







The iniquities done by a wicked man will trap him, And he will be held with the cords of his sin. 















###### 23 







He will die for lack of instruction (discipline), And in the greatness of his foolishness he will go astray _and_ be lost. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Proverbs 6

***
















###### 1 







My son, if you have become surety (guaranteed a debt or obligation) for your neighbor, If you have given your pledge for [the debt of] a stranger _or_ another [outside your family], 















###### 2 







If you have been snared with the words of your lips, If you have been trapped by the speech of your mouth, 















###### 3 







Do this now, my son, and release yourself [from the obligation]; [^a]Since you have come into the hand of your neighbor, Go humble yourself, and plead with your neighbor [to pay his debt and release you]. 















###### 4 







Give no [unnecessary] sleep to your eyes, Nor slumber to your eyelids; 















###### 5 







Tear yourself away like a gazelle from the hand of _the hunter_ And like a bird from the hand of the fowler. 















###### 6 







Go to the ant, O lazy one; Observe her ways and be wise, 















###### 7 







Which, having no chief, Overseer or ruler, 















###### 8 







She prepares her food in the summer And brings in her provisions [of food for the winter] in the harvest. 















###### 9 







How long will you lie down, O lazy one? When will you arise from your sleep [and learn self-discipline]? 















###### 10 







"Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, A little folding of the hands to lie down _and_ rest"-- 















###### 11 







So your poverty will come like an _approaching_ prowler who walks [slowly, but surely] And your need [will come] like an armed man [making you helpless]. 















###### 12 







A worthless person, a wicked man, Is one who walks with a perverse (corrupt, vulgar) mouth. 















###### 13 







Who winks with his eyes [in mockery], who shuffles his feet [to signal], Who points with his fingers [to give subversive instruction]; 















###### 14 







Who perversely in his heart plots trouble _and_ evil continually; Who spreads discord _and_ strife. 















###### 15 







Therefore [the crushing weight of] his disaster will come suddenly _upon him_; Instantly he will be broken, and there will be no healing _or_ remedy [because he has no heart for God]. 















###### 16 







These six things the LORD hates; Indeed, seven are repulsive to Him: 















###### 17 







A proud look [the attitude that makes one overestimate oneself and discount others], a lying tongue, And hands that shed innocent blood, 















###### 18 







A heart that creates wicked plans, Feet that run swiftly to evil, 















###### 19 







A false witness who breathes out lies [even half-truths], And one who spreads discord (rumors) among brothers. 















###### 20 







My son, be guided by your father's [God-given] commandment (instruction) And do not [^b]reject the teaching of your mother; 















###### 21 







Bind them continually upon your heart (in your thoughts), And tie them around your neck. 















###### 22 







When you walk about, they (the godly teachings of your parents) will guide you; When you sleep, they will keep watch over you; And when you awake, they will talk to you. 















###### 23 







For the commandment is a lamp, and the teaching [of the law] is light, And reproofs (rebukes) for discipline are the way of life, 















###### 24 







To keep you from the evil woman, From [the flattery of] the smooth tongue of an immoral woman. 















###### 25 







Do not desire (lust after) her beauty in your heart, Nor let her capture you with her eyelashes. 















###### 26 







For on account of a prostitute one is reduced to a piece of bread [to be eaten up], And the immoral woman hunts [with a hook] the precious life [of a man]. 















###### 27 







Can a man take fire to his chest And his clothes not be burned? 















###### 28 







Or can a man walk on hot coals And his feet not be scorched? 















###### 29 







So is the one who goes in to his neighbor's wife; Whoever touches her will not be found innocent _or_ go unpunished. 















###### 30 







People do not despise a thief if he steals To satisfy himself when he is hungry; 















###### 31 







But when he is found, he must repay seven times [what he stole]; He must give all the property of his house [if necessary to meet his fine]. 















###### 32 







But whoever commits adultery with a woman lacks common sense _and_ sound judgment _and_ an understanding [of moral principles]; He who would destroy his soul does it. 















###### 33 







Wounds and disgrace he will find, And his reproach (blame) will not be blotted out. 















###### 34 







For jealousy enrages the [wronged] husband; He will not spare [the guilty one] on the day of vengeance. 















###### 35 







He will not accept any ransom [offered to buy him off from demanding full punishment]; Nor will he be satisfied though you offer him many gifts (bribes). ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Proverbs 7

***
















###### 1 







My son, keep my words And treasure my commandments within you [so they are readily available to guide you]. 















###### 2 







Keep my commandments and live, And keep my teaching _and_ law as the apple of your eye. 















###### 3 







Bind them [securely] on your fingers; Write them on the tablet of your heart. 















###### 4 







Say to [skillful and godly] wisdom, "You are my sister," And regard understanding _and_ intelligent insight as your intimate friends; 















###### 5 







That they may keep you from the immoral woman, From the foreigner [who does not observe God's laws and] who flatters with her [smooth] words. 















###### 6 







For at the window of my house I looked out through my lattice. 















###### 7 







And among the naive [the inexperienced and gullible], I saw among the youths A young man lacking [good] sense, 















###### 8 







Passing through the street near her corner; And he took the path to her house 















###### 9 







In the twilight, in the evening; In the black and dark night. 















###### 10 







And there a woman met him, Dressed as a prostitute and sly _and_ cunning of heart. 















###### 11 







She was boisterous and rebellious; [^a]She would not stay at home. 















###### 12 







At times _she was_ in the streets, at times in the market places, Lurking _and_ setting her ambush at every corner. 















###### 13 







So she caught him and kissed him And with a brazen _and_ impudent face she said to him: 















###### 14 







"I have peace offerings with me; Today I have paid my vows. 















###### 15 







"So I came out to meet you [that you might share with me the feast of my offering], Diligently I sought your face and I have found you. 















###### 16 







"I have spread my couch with coverings _and_ cushions of tapestry, With colored fine linen of Egypt. 















###### 17 







"I have perfumed my bed With myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 















###### 18 







"Come, let us drink our fill of love until morning; Let us console _and_ delight ourselves with love. 















###### 19 







"For my husband is not at home. He has gone on a long journey; 















###### 20 







He has taken a bag of money with him, And he will come home on the appointed day." 















###### 21 







With her many persuasions she caused him to yield; With her flattering lips she seduced him. 















###### 22 







Suddenly he went after her, as an ox goes to the slaughter [not knowing the outcome], Or as one in stocks going to the correction [to be given] to a fool, 















###### 23 







Until an arrow pierced his liver [with a mortal wound]; Like a bird fluttering straight into the net, He did not know that it _would cost_ him his life. 















###### 24 







Now therefore, my sons, listen to me, And pay attention to the words of my mouth. 















###### 25 







Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways, Do not stray into her [evil, immoral] paths. 















###### 26 







For she has cast down many [mortally] wounded; Indeed, all who were killed by her were strong. 















###### 27 







Her house is the way to [^b]Sheol, Descending to the chambers of death. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

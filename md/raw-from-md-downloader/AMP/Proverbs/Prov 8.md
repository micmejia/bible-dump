# Proverbs 8

***
















###### 1 







Does not wisdom call, And understanding lift up her voice? 















###### 2 







On the top of the heights beside the way, Where the paths meet, wisdom takes her stand; 















###### 3 







Beside the gates, at the entrance to the city, At the entrance of the doors, she cries out: 















###### 4 







"To you, O men, I call, And my voice is directed to the sons of men. 















###### 5 







"O you naive _or_ inexperienced [who are easily misled], understand prudence _and_ seek astute common sense; And, O you [closed-minded, self-confident] fools, understand wisdom [seek the insight and self-discipline that leads to godly living]. 















###### 6 







"Listen, for I will speak excellent _and_ noble things; And the opening of my lips _will reveal_ right things. 















###### 7 







"For my mouth will utter truth, And wickedness is repulsive _and_ loathsome to my lips. 















###### 8 







"All the words of my mouth are in righteousness (upright, in right standing with God); There is nothing contrary to truth or perverted (crooked) in them. 















###### 9 







"They are all straightforward to him who understands [with an open and willing mind], And right to those who find knowledge _and_ live by it. 















###### 10 







"Take my instruction rather than [seeking] silver, And take knowledge rather than choicest gold, 















###### 11 







"For wisdom is better than rubies; And all desirable things cannot compare with her. 















###### 12 







"I, [godly] wisdom, reside with prudence [good judgment, moral courage and astute common sense], And I find knowledge and discretion. 















###### 13 







"The [reverent] fear _and_ worshipful awe of the LORD _includes_ the hatred of evil; Pride and arrogance and the evil way, And the perverted mouth, I hate. 















###### 14 







"Counsel is mine and sound wisdom; I am understanding, power _and_ strength are mine. 















###### 15 







"By me kings reign And rulers decide _and_ decree justice. 















###### 16 







"By me princes rule, and nobles, All who judge _and_ govern rightly. 















###### 17 







"I love those who love me; And those who seek me early _and_ diligently will find me. 















###### 18 







"Riches and honor are with me, Enduring wealth and righteousness (right standing with God). 















###### 19 







"My fruit is better than gold, even pure gold, And my yield is better than choicest silver. 















###### 20 







"I, [Wisdom, continuously] walk in the way of righteousness, In the midst of the paths of justice, 















###### 21 







That I may cause those who love me to inherit wealth _and_ true riches, And that I may fill their treasuries. 















###### 22 







"The LORD created _and_ possessed me at the beginning of His way, Before His works of old [were accomplished]. 















###### 23 







"From everlasting I was established _and_ ordained, From the beginning, before the earth existed, [I, godly wisdom, existed]. 















###### 24 







"When there were no ocean depths I was born, When there were no fountains _and_ springs overflowing with water. 















###### 25 







"Before the mountains were settled, Before the hills, I was born; 















###### 26 







While He had not yet made the earth and the fields, Or the first of the dust of the earth. 















###### 27 







"When He established the heavens, I [Wisdom] was there; When He drew a circle upon the face of the deep, 















###### 28 







When He made firm the skies above, When the fountains and springs of the deep became fixed _and_ strong, 















###### 29 







When He set for the sea its boundary So that the waters would not transgress [the boundaries set by] His command, When He marked out the foundations of the earth-- 















###### 30 







Then I was beside Him, as a master craftsman; And I was daily His delight; Rejoicing before Him always, 















###### 31 







Rejoicing in the world, His inhabited earth, And having my delight in the sons of men. 















###### 32 







"Now therefore, O sons, listen to me, For blessed [happy, prosperous, to be admired] are they who keep my ways. 















###### 33 







"Heed (pay attention to) instruction and be wise, And do not ignore _or_ neglect it. 















###### 34 







"Blessed [happy, prosperous, to be admired] is the man who listens to me, Watching daily at my gates, Waiting at my doorposts. 















###### 35 







"For whoever finds me (Wisdom) finds life And obtains favor _and_ grace from the LORD. 















###### 36 







"But he who fails to find me _or_ sins against me injures himself; All those who hate me love _and_ court death." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

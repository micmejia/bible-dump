# Proverbs 9

***
















###### 1 







Wisdom has built her [spacious and sufficient] house; She has hewn out _and_ set up her seven pillars. 















###### 2 







She has prepared her food, she has mixed her wine; She has also set her table. 















###### 3 







She has sent out her maidens, she calls From the highest places of the city: 















###### 4 







"Whoever is naive _or_ inexperienced, let him turn in here!" As for him who lacks understanding, she says, 















###### 5 







"Come, eat my food And drink the wine I have mixed [and accept my gifts]. 















###### 6 







"Leave [behind] your foolishness [and the foolish] and live, And walk in the way of insight _and_ understanding." 















###### 7 







He who corrects _and_ instructs a scoffer gets dishonor for himself, And he who rebukes a wicked man gets insults for himself. 















###### 8 







[^a]Do not correct a scoffer [who foolishly ridicules and takes no responsibility for his error] or he will hate you; Correct a wise man [who learns from his error], and he will love you. 















###### 9 







Give _instruction_ to a wise man and he will become even wiser; Teach a righteous man and he will increase his learning. 















###### 10 







The [reverent] fear of the LORD [that is, worshiping Him and regarding Him as truly awesome] is the beginning _and_ the preeminent part of wisdom [its starting point and its essence], And the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding _and_ spiritual insight. 















###### 11 







For by me (wisdom from God) your days will be multiplied, And years of life shall be increased. 















###### 12 







If you are wise, you are wise for yourself [for your own benefit]; If you scoff [thoughtlessly ridicule and disdain], you alone will pay the penalty. 















###### 13 







The foolish woman is restless _and_ noisy; She is naive _and_ easily misled _and_ thoughtless, and knows nothing at all [of eternal value]. 















###### 14 







She sits at the doorway of her house, On a seat by the high _and_ conspicuous places of the city, 















###### 15 







Calling to those who pass by, Who are making their paths straight: 















###### 16 







"Whoever is naive _or_ inexperienced, let him turn in here!" And to him who lacks understanding (common sense), she says, 















###### 17 







"Stolen waters (pleasures) are sweet [because they are forbidden]; And bread _eaten_ in secret is pleasant." 















###### 18 







But he does not know that the spirits of the dead are there, And that her guests are [already] in the depths of Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead). ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

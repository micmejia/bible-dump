# Psalms 1

***
















###### 1 







[^a]Blessed [fortunate, prosperous, and favored by God] is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked [following their advice and example], Nor stand in the path of sinners, Nor sit [down to rest] in the seat of [^b]scoffers (ridiculers). 















###### 2 







But his delight is in the law of the LORD, And on His law [His precepts and teachings] he [habitually] meditates day and night. 















###### 3 







And he will be like a tree _firmly_ planted [and fed] by streams of water, Which yields its fruit in its season; Its leaf does not wither; And in whatever he does, he prospers [and comes to maturity]. 















###### 4 







The wicked [those who live in disobedience to God's law] are not so, But they are like the chaff [worthless and without substance] which the wind blows away. 















###### 5 







Therefore the wicked will not stand [unpunished] in the judgment, Nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous. 















###### 6 







For the LORD knows _and_ fully approves the way of the righteous, But the way of the wicked shall perish. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

It opens with a benediction, “Blessed,” as does the Sermon on the Mount (Matt 5:3). [^b]: Psalm 1:1 I.e. shallow thinkers who are quick to mock or disdain.

# Psalms 100

***
















###### 1 







Shout joyfully to the LORD, all the earth. 















###### 2 







Serve the LORD with gladness _and_ delight; Come before His presence with joyful singing. 















###### 3 







Know _and_ fully recognize with gratitude that the LORD Himself is God; It is He who has made us, [^a]not we ourselves [and we are His]. _We are_ His people and the sheep of His pasture. 















###### 4 







Enter His gates with a song of thanksgiving And His courts with praise. Be thankful to Him, bless _and_ praise His name. 















###### 5 







For the LORD is good; His mercy _and_ lovingkindness are everlasting, His faithfulness [endures] to all generations. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

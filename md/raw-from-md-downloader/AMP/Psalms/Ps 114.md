# Psalms 114

***
















###### 1 







When Israel came out of Egypt, The house of Jacob from a people of strange language, 















###### 2 







Judah became His sanctuary, And Israel His dominion. 















###### 3 







The [Red] Sea [^a]looked and fled; The Jordan turned back. 















###### 4 







The mountains leaped like rams, The [little] hills, like lambs. 















###### 5 







What ails you, O sea, that you flee? O Jordan, that you turn back? 















###### 6 







O mountains, that you leap like rams, O [little] hills, like lambs? 















###### 7 







Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord, At the presence of the God of Jacob (Israel), 















###### 8 







Who turned the rock into a pool of water, The flint into a fountain of water. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Psalms 121

***
















###### 1 







I will lift up my eyes to the hills [of Jerusalem]-- From where shall my help come? 















###### 2 







My help comes from the LORD, Who made heaven and earth. 















###### 3 







He will not allow your foot to slip; He who keeps you will not slumber. 















###### 4 







Behold, He who keeps Israel Will neither slumber [briefly] nor sleep [soundly]. 















###### 5 







The LORD is your keeper; The LORD is your shade on your right hand. 















###### 6 







The sun will not strike you by day, Nor the moon by night. 















###### 7 







The LORD will protect you from all evil; He will keep your life. 















###### 8 







The LORD will guard your going out and your coming in [everything that you do] From this time forth and forever. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

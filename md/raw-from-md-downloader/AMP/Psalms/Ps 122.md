# Psalms 122

***
















###### 1 







I was glad when they said to me, "Let us go to the house of the LORD." 















###### 2 







Our feet are standing Within your gates, O Jerusalem, 















###### 3 







Jerusalem, that is built As a city that is firmly joined together; 















###### 4 







To which the [twelve] tribes go up, even the tribes of the LORD, [As was decreed as] an ordinance for Israel, To give thanks to the name of the LORD. 















###### 5 







For there the thrones of judgment were set, The thrones of the house of David. 















###### 6 







Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: "May they prosper who love you [holy city]. 















###### 7 







"May peace be within your walls And prosperity within your palaces." 















###### 8 







For the sake of my brothers and my friends, I will now say, "May peace be within you." 















###### 9 







For the sake of the house of the LORD our God [which is Jerusalem], I will seek your (the city's) good. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

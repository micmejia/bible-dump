# Psalms 123

***
















###### 1 







Unto you I lift up my eyes, O You who are enthroned in the heavens! 















###### 2 







Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master, And as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress, So our eyes look to the LORD our God, Until He is gracious _and_ favorable toward us. 















###### 3 







Be gracious to us, O LORD, be gracious _and_ favorable toward us, For we are greatly filled with contempt. 















###### 4 







Our soul is greatly filled With the scoffing of those who are at ease, And with the contempt of the proud [who disregard God's law]. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

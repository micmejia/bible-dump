# Psalms 124

***
















###### 1 







"If it had not been the LORD who was on our side," Let Israel now say, 















###### 2 







"If it had not been the LORD who was on our side When men rose up against us, 















###### 3 







Then they would have [quickly] swallowed us alive, When their wrath was kindled against us; 















###### 4 







Then the waters would have engulfed us, The torrent would have swept over our soul; 















###### 5 







Then the [^b]raging waters would have swept over our soul." 















###### 6 







Blessed be the LORD, Who has not given us as prey to be torn by their teeth. 















###### 7 







We have escaped like a bird from the snare of the fowlers; The trap is broken and we have escaped. 















###### 8

# Psalms 125

***
















###### 1 







Those who trust in _and_ rely on the LORD [with confident expectation] Are like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved but remains forever. 















###### 2 







As the mountains surround Jerusalem, So the LORD surrounds His people From this time forth and forever. 















###### 3 







For the scepter of wickedness shall not rest on the land of the righteous, So that the righteous will not reach out their hands to do wrong. 















###### 4 







Do good, O LORD, to those who are good And to those who are upright in their hearts. 















###### 5 







But as for those who turn aside to their crooked ways [in unresponsiveness to God], The LORD will lead them away with those who do evil. Peace be upon Israel. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

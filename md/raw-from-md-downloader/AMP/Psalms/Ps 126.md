# Psalms 126

***
















###### 1 







When the LORD brought back the captives to Zion (Jerusalem), We were like those who dream [it seemed so unreal]. 















###### 2 







Then our mouth was filled with laughter And our tongue with joyful shouting; Then they said among the nations, "The LORD has done great things for them." 















###### 3 







The LORD has done great things for us; We are glad! 















###### 4 







Restore our [^b]captivity, O LORD, As the stream-beds in the South (the Negev) [are restored by torrents of rain]. 















###### 5 







They who sow in tears shall reap with joyful singing. 















###### 6 







He who goes back and forth weeping, carrying his bag of seed [for planting], Will indeed come again with a shout of joy, bringing his sheaves with him. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

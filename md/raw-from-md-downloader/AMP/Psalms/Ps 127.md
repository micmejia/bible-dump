# Psalms 127

***
















###### 1 







Unless the LORD builds the house, They labor in vain who build it; Unless the LORD guards the city, The watchman keeps awake in vain. 















###### 2 







It is vain for you to rise early, To retire late, To eat the bread of anxious labors-- For He gives [blessings] to His beloved _even in his_ sleep. 















###### 3 







Behold, children are a heritage _and_ gift from the LORD, The fruit of the womb a reward. 















###### 4 







Like arrows in the hand of a warrior, So are the children of one's youth. 















###### 5 







How blessed [happy and fortunate] is the man whose quiver is filled with them; They will not be ashamed When they speak with their enemies [in gatherings] at the [city] gate. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

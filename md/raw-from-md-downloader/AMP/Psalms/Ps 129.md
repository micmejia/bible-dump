# Psalms 129

***
















###### 1 







"Many times they have persecuted me (Israel) from my youth," Let Israel now say, 















###### 2 







"Many times they have persecuted me from my youth, Yet they have not prevailed against me. 















###### 3 







"The [enemies, like] plowers plowed on my back; They made their furrows [of suffering] long [in Israel]." 















###### 4 







The LORD is righteous; He has cut in two the [thick] cords of the wicked [which enslaved the people of Israel]. 















###### 5 







May all who hate Zion Be put to shame and turned backward [in defeat]. 















###### 6 







Let them be like the grass on the housetops, Which withers before it grows up, 















###### 7 







With which the reaper does not fill his hand, Nor the binder of sheaves his arms, 















###### 8 







Nor do those who pass by say, "The blessing of the LORD be upon you; We bless you in the name of the LORD." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

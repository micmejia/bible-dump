# Psalms 13

***
















###### 1 







How long, O LORD? Will You forget me forever? How long will You hide Your face from me? 















###### 2 







How long must I take counsel in my soul, _Having_ sorrow in my heart day after day? How long will my enemy exalt himself _and_ triumph over me? 















###### 3 







Consider and answer me, O LORD my God; Give light (life) to my eyes, or I will sleep the _sleep of_ death, 















###### 4 







And my enemy will say, "I have overcome him," And my adversaries will rejoice when I am shaken. 















###### 5 







But I have trusted _and_ relied on _and_ been confident in Your lovingkindness _and_ faithfulness; My heart shall rejoice _and_ delight in Your salvation. 















###### 6 







I will sing to the LORD, Because He has dealt bountifully with me. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

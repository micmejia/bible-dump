# Psalms 137

***
















###### 1 







By the rivers of Babylon, There we [captives] sat down and wept, When we remembered Zion [the city God imprinted on our hearts]. 















###### 2 







On the willow trees in the midst of Babylon We hung our harps. 















###### 3 







For there they who took us captive demanded of us a song with words, And our tormentors [who made a mockery of us demanded] amusement, _saying_, "Sing us one of the songs of Zion." 















###### 4 







How can we sing the Lord's song In a strange _and_ foreign land? 















###### 5 







If I forget you, O Jerusalem, Let my right hand forget [her skill with the harp]. 















###### 6 







Let my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth If I do not remember you, If I do not prefer Jerusalem Above my chief joy. 















###### 7 







Remember, O LORD, against the sons of Edom, The day of [the fall of] Jerusalem, Who said "Down, down [with her] To her very foundation." 















###### 8 







O daughter of Babylon, you devastator, How blessed will be the one Who repays you [with destruction] as you have repaid us. 















###### 9 







How blessed will be the one who seizes and dashes your little ones Against the rock. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

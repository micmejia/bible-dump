# Psalms 15

***
















###### 1 







O LORD, who may lodge [as a guest] in Your tent? Who may dwell [continually] on Your holy hill? 















###### 2 







He who walks with integrity _and_ strength of character, and works righteousness, And speaks _and_ holds truth in his heart. 















###### 3 







He does not slander with his tongue, Nor does evil to his neighbor, Nor takes up a reproach against his friend; 















###### 4 







In his eyes an evil person is despised, But he honors those who fear the LORD [and obediently worship Him with awe-inspired reverence and submissive wonder]. He keeps his word even to his own disadvantage and does not change it [for his own benefit]; 















###### 5 







He does not put out his money at interest [to a fellow Israelite], And does not take a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things will never be shaken. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

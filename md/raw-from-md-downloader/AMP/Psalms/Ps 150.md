Praise the LORD! Praise God in His sanctuary; Praise Him in His mighty heavens.

Praise Him for His mighty acts; Praise Him according to [the abundance of] His greatness.

Praise Him with trumpet sound; Praise Him with harp and lyre.

Praise Him with resounding cymbals; Praise Him with loud cymbals.

# Psalms 2

***
















###### 1 







Why are the [^a]nations in an [^b]uproar [in turmoil against God], And why do the people devise a vain _and_ hopeless plot? 















###### 2 







The kings of the earth take their stand; And the rulers take counsel together Against the LORD and His Anointed (the Davidic King, the Messiah, the Christ), saying, 















###### 3 







"Let us break apart their [divine] bands [of restraint] And cast away their cords [of control] from us." 















###### 4 







He who sits [enthroned] in the heavens laughs [at their rebellion]; The [Sovereign] [^c]Lord scoffs at them [and in supreme contempt He mocks them]. 















###### 5 







Then He will speak to them in His [profound] anger And terrify them with His displeasure, saying, 















###### 6 







"Yet as for Me, I have anointed _and_ firmly installed My King Upon Zion, My holy mountain." 















###### 7 







"I will declare the decree of the LORD: He said to Me, 'You are My Son; This day [I proclaim] I have begotten You. 















###### 8 







'Ask of Me, and I will assuredly give [You] the nations as Your inheritance, And the ends of the earth as Your possession. 















###### 9 







'You shall break them with a rod of iron; You shall shatter them [in pieces] like earthenware.'" 















###### 10 







Now therefore, O kings, act wisely; Be instructed _and_ take warning, O leaders (judges, rulers) of the earth. 















###### 11 







Worship the LORD _and_ serve Him with reverence [with awe-inspired fear and submissive wonder]; Rejoice [yet do so] with trembling. 















###### 12 







Kiss (pay respect to) the [^d]Son, so that He does not become angry, and you perish in the way, For His wrath may soon be kindled _and_ set aflame. How blessed [fortunate, prosperous, and favored by God] are all those who take refuge in Him! ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: Psalm 2:1 I.e. a confusion of voices. [^c]: Psalm 2:4 Heb _Adonai_. [^d]: Psalm 2:12 The word in the original is _bar_, taken to be the Aramaic for “son.” But it is surprising that an Aramaic word would be used here. The ancient rabbis maintained that a different word with the same spelling in Hebrew was intended, whose meaning is “pure.” They claimed that it is a reference to the Torah, on the ground that all the words in the Torah are pure.

# Psalms 3

***
















###### 1 







O LORD, how my enemies have increased! Many are rising up against me. 















###### 2 







Many are saying of me, "There is no help [no salvation] for him in God." [^a]Selah. 















###### 3 







But You, O LORD, are a shield for me, My glory [and my honor], and the One who lifts my head. 















###### 4 







With my voice I was crying to the LORD, And He answered me from His holy mountain. Selah. 















###### 5 







I lay down and slept [safely]; I awakened, for the LORD sustains me. 















###### 6 







I will not be intimidated _or_ afraid of the ten thousands Who have set themselves against me all around. 















###### 7 







Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God! For You have struck all my enemies on the cheek; You have shattered the teeth of the wicked. 















###### 8 







Salvation belongs to the LORD; May Your blessing be upon Your people.

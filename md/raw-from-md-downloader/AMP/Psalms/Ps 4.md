# Psalms 4

***
















###### 1 







Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness! You have freed me when I was hemmed in _and_ relieved me when I was in distress; Be gracious to me and hear [and respond to] my prayer. 















###### 2 







O sons of men, how long will my honor _and_ glory be [turned into] shame? _How long_ will you [my enemies] love worthless (vain, futile) things and seek deception _and_ lies? Selah. 















###### 3 







But know that the LORD has set apart for Himself [and dealt wonderfully with] the godly man [the one of honorable character and moral courage--the one who does right]. The LORD hears _and_ responds when I call to Him. 















###### 4 







Tremble [with anger or fear], and do not sin; Meditate in your heart upon your bed and be still [reflect on your sin and repent of your rebellion]. Selah. 















###### 5 







Offer righteous sacrifices; Trust [confidently] in the LORD. 















###### 6 







Many are saying, "Oh, that we might see some good!" Lift up the light of Your face upon us, O LORD. 















###### 7 







You have put joy in my heart, More than [others know] when their wheat and new wine have yielded abundantly. 















###### 8 







In peace [and with a tranquil heart] I will both lie down and sleep, For You alone, O LORD, make me dwell in safety _and_ confident trust. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

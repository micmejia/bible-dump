# Psalms 43

***
















###### 1 







Judge _and_ vindicate me, O God; plead my case against an ungodly nation. O rescue me from the deceitful and unjust man! 















###### 2 







For You are the God of my strength [my stronghold--in whom I take refuge]; why have You rejected me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy? 















###### 3 







O send out Your light and Your truth, let them lead me; Let them bring me to Your holy hill And to Your dwelling places. 















###### 4 







Then I will go to the altar of God, To God, my exceeding joy; With the lyre I will praise You, O God, my God! 















###### 5 







Why are you in despair, O my soul? And why are you restless _and_ disturbed within me? Hope in God _and_ wait expectantly for Him, for I shall again praise Him, The [^a]help of my [sad] countenance and my God. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Psalms 5

***
















###### 1 







Listen to my words, O LORD, Consider my groaning _and_ sighing. 















###### 2 







Heed the sound of my cry for help, my King and my God, For to You I pray. 















###### 3 







In the morning, O LORD, You will hear my voice; In the morning I will prepare [a prayer and a sacrifice] for You and watch _and_ wait [for You to speak to my heart]. 















###### 4 







For You are not a God who takes pleasure in wickedness; No evil [person] dwells with You. 















###### 5 







The boastful _and_ the arrogant will not stand in Your sight; You hate all who do evil. 















###### 6 







You destroy those who tell lies; The LORD detests _and_ rejects the bloodthirsty and deceitful man. 















###### 7 







But as for me, I will enter Your house through the abundance of Your steadfast love _and_ tender mercy; At Your holy temple I will bow [obediently] in reverence for You. 















###### 8 







O LORD, lead me in Your righteousness because of my enemies; Make Your way straight (direct, right) before me. 















###### 9 







For there is nothing trustworthy _or_ reliable _or_ truthful in what they say; Their heart is destruction [just a treacherous chasm, a yawning gulf of lies]. Their throat is an open grave; They [glibly] flatter with their [silken] tongue. 















###### 10 







Hold them guilty, O God; Let them fall by their own designs _and_ councils! Cast them out because of the abundance of their transgressions, For they are mutinous _and_ have rebelled against You. 















###### 11 







But let all who take refuge _and_ put their trust in You rejoice, Let them ever sing for joy; Because You cover _and_ shelter them, Let those who love Your name be joyful _and_ exult in You. 















###### 12 







For You, O LORD, bless the righteous man [the one who is in right standing with You]; You surround him with favor as with a shield. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Psalms 54

***
















###### 1 







Save me, O God, by Your name; And vindicate me by Your [wondrous] power. 















###### 2 







Hear my prayer, O God; Listen to the words of my mouth. 















###### 3 







For strangers have risen against me And violent men have sought my life; They have not set God before them. Selah. 















###### 4 







Behold, God is my helper _and_ ally; The Lord is the sustainer of my soul [my upholder]. 















###### 5 







He will pay back the evil to my enemies; In Your faithfulness destroy them. 















###### 6 







With a freewill offering I will sacrifice to You; I will give thanks _and_ praise Your name, O LORD, for it is good. 















###### 7 







For He has rescued me from every trouble, And my eye has looked _with satisfaction_ (triumph) on my enemies. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

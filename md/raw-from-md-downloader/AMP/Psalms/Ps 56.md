# Psalms 56

***
















###### 1 







Be gracious to me, O God, for man has trampled on me; All day long the adversary oppresses _and_ torments me. 















###### 2 







My enemies have trampled upon me all day long, For they are many who fight proudly against me. 















###### 3 







When I am afraid, I will put my trust _and_ faith in You. 















###### 4 







In God, whose word I praise; In God I have put my trust; I shall not fear. What can mere man do to me? 















###### 5 







All day long they twist my words _and_ say hurtful things; All their thoughts are against me for evil. 















###### 6 







They attack, they hide _and_ lurk, They watch my steps, As they have [expectantly] waited _to take_ my life. 















###### 7 







Cast them out because of their wickedness. In anger bring down the peoples, O God! 















###### 8 







You have taken account of my wanderings; Put my tears in Your bottle. Are they not recorded in Your book? 















###### 9 







Then my enemies will turn back in the day when I call; This I know, that God is for me. 















###### 10 







In God, _whose_ word I praise, In the LORD, _whose_ word I praise, 















###### 11 







In God have I put my trust _and_ confident reliance; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me? 















###### 12 







Your vows are _binding_ upon me, O God; I will give thank offerings to You. 















###### 13 







For You have rescued my soul from death, Yes, and my feet from stumbling, So that I may walk before God In the light of life. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

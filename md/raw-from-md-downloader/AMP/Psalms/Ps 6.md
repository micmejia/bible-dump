# Psalms 6

***
















###### 1 







O LORD, do not rebuke _or_ punish me in Your anger, Nor discipline me in Your wrath. 















###### 2 







Have mercy on me _and_ be gracious to me, O LORD, for I am weak (faint, frail); Heal me, O LORD, for my bones are dismayed _and_ anguished. 















###### 3 







My soul [as well as my body] is greatly dismayed. But as for You, O LORD--how long [until You act on my behalf]? 















###### 4 







Return, O LORD, rescue my soul; Save me because of Your [unfailing] steadfast love _and_ mercy. 















###### 5 







For in death there is no mention of You; In Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead) who will praise You _and_ give You thanks? 















###### 6 







I am weary with my groaning; Every night I soak my bed with tears, I drench my couch with my weeping. 















###### 7 







My eye grows dim with grief; It grows old because of all my enemies. 















###### 8 







Depart from me, all you who do evil, For the LORD has heard the voice of my weeping. 















###### 9 







The LORD has heard my supplication [my plea for grace]; The LORD receives my prayer. 















###### 10 







Let all my enemies be ashamed and greatly horrified; Let them turn back, let them suddenly be ashamed [of what they have done]. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

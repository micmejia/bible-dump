God be gracious _and_ kind-hearted to us and bless us, And make His face shine [with favor] on us-- Selah.

That Your way may be known on earth, Your salvation _and_ deliverance among all nations. 















###### 3 







Let the [^a]peoples praise You, O God; Let all the peoples praise You. 















###### 4 







Let the nations be glad and sing for joy, For You will judge the people fairly And guide the nations on earth. Selah.

Let the peoples praise You, O God; Let all the peoples praise You. 















###### 6 







The earth has yielded its harvest [as evidence of His approval]; God, our God, blesses us.

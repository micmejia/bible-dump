# Psalms 70

***
















###### 1 







O God, _come quickly_ to save me; O LORD, come quickly to help me! 















###### 2 







Let those be ashamed and humiliated Who seek my life; Let them be turned back and humiliated Who delight in my hurt. 















###### 3 







Let them be turned back because of their shame _and_ disgrace Who say, "Aha, aha!" 















###### 4 







May all those who seek You [as life's first priority] rejoice and be glad in You; May those who love Your salvation say continually, "Let God be magnified!" 















###### 5 







But I am afflicted and needy; Come quickly to me, O God! You are my help and my rescuer; O LORD, do not delay. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

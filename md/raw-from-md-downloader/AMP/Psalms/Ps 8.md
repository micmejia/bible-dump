# Psalms 8

***
















###### 1 







O LORD, our Lord, How majestic _and_ glorious _and_ excellent is Your name in all the earth! You have displayed Your splendor above the heavens. 















###### 2 







Out of the mouths of infants and nursing babes You have established strength Because of Your adversaries, That You might silence the enemy _and_ make the revengeful cease. 















###### 3 







When I see _and_ consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, The moon and the stars, which You have established, 















###### 4 







What is man that You are mindful of him, And the son of [earthborn] man that You care for him? 















###### 5 







Yet You have made him a little lower than [^b]God, And You have crowned him with glory and honor. 















###### 6 







You made him to have dominion over the works of Your hands; You have put all things under his feet, 















###### 7 







All sheep and oxen, And also the beasts of the field, 















###### 8 







The birds of the air, and the fish of the sea, Whatever passes through the paths of the seas. 















###### 9

[^b]: Psalm 8:5 LXX reads _angels_; Heb _Elohim_ is usually translated “God” or “god.” But it can also mean “gods” (with a lowercase “g”) when it is used with reference to the pagan gods of other nations. See, for instance, Ex 20:3: “You shall have no other gods (_Elohim_) before Me.” Since there are no capital letters in Hebrew as there are in English, the meaning of Ps 8:5 is ambiguous. It may be saying that humans were created a little lower than God Himself, or it may say that humans were created a little lower than the heavenly beings.

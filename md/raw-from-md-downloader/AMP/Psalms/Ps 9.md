# Psalms 9

***
















###### 1 







I will give thanks _and_ praise the LORD, with all my heart; I will tell aloud all Your wonders _and_ marvelous deeds. 















###### 2 







I will rejoice and exult in you; I will sing praise to Your name, O Most High. 















###### 3 







When my enemies turn back, They stumble and perish before You. 















###### 4 







For You have maintained my right and my cause; You have sat on the throne judging righteously. 















###### 5 







You have rebuked the nations, You have destroyed the wicked _and_ unrepentant; You have wiped out their name forever and ever. 















###### 6 







The enemy has been cut off _and_ has vanished in everlasting ruins, You have uprooted their cities; The very memory of them has perished. 















###### 7 







But the LORD will remain _and_ sit enthroned forever; He has prepared _and_ established His throne for judgment. 















###### 8 







And He will judge the world in righteousness; He will execute judgment for the nations with fairness (equity). 















###### 9 







The LORD also will be a refuge _and_ a stronghold for the oppressed, A refuge in times of trouble; 















###### 10 







And those who know Your name [who have experienced Your precious mercy] will put their confident trust in You, For You, O LORD, have not abandoned those who seek You. 















###### 11 







Sing praises to the LORD, who dwells in Zion; Declare among the peoples His [great and wondrous] deeds. 















###### 12 







For He who avenges blood [unjustly shed] remembers them (His people); He does not forget the cry of the afflicted _and_ abused. 















###### 13 







Have mercy on me _and_ be gracious to me, O LORD; See how I am afflicted by those who hate me, You who lift me up from the gates of death, 















###### 14 







That I may tell aloud all Your praises, That in the gates of the daughter of Zion (Jerusalem) I may rejoice in Your salvation _and_ Your help. 















###### 15 







The nations have sunk down in the pit which they have made; In the net which they hid, their own foot has been caught. 















###### 16 







The LORD has made Himself known; He executes judgment; The wicked are trapped by the work of their own hands. Higgaion (meditation) Selah. 















###### 17 







The wicked will turn to Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead), _Even_ all the nations who forget God. 















###### 18 







For the poor will not always be forgotten, Nor the hope of the burdened perish forever. 















###### 19 







Arise, O LORD, do not let man prevail; Let the nations be judged before You. 















###### 20 







Put them in [reverent] [^b]fear of You, O LORD, So that the nations may know they are but [frail and mortal] men. Selah. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

Possibly referring to a tune titled “Death to the Son.” Perhaps for soprano voices. [^b]: Psalm 9:20 The “fear” of God is a common concept in the OT, but is difficult to translate into English. It is not simply a matter of “fear” in the modern English sense. Nor is it only a sentiment of deep reverence. It implies obedience, as well.

# Psalms 93

***
















###### 1 







The LORD reigns, He is clothed with majesty _and_ splendor; The LORD has clothed and encircled Himself with strength; the world is firmly established, it cannot be moved. 















###### 2 







Your throne is established from of old; You are from everlasting. 















###### 3 







The floods have lifted up, O LORD, The floods have lifted up their voice; The floods lift up their pounding waves. 















###### 4 







More than the sounds of many waters, More than the mighty breakers of the sea, The LORD on high is mighty. 















###### 5 







Your precepts are fully confirmed _and_ completely reliable; Holiness adorns Your house, O LORD, forever. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

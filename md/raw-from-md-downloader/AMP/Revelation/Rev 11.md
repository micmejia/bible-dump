# Revelation 11

***
















###### 1 







Then there was given to me a [^a]measuring rod like a staff; and someone said, "[^b]Rise and measure the temple of God and the altar [of incense], and [count] those who worship in it. 















###### 2 







But leave out the court [of the Gentiles] which is outside the temple and do not measure it, because it has been given to the Gentiles (the nations); and they will trample the holy city for forty-two months (three and one-half years). 















###### 3 







And I will grant _authority_ to My two witnesses, and they will prophesy for twelve hundred and sixty days (forty-two months; three and one-half years), dressed in [^c]sackcloth." 















###### 4 







These [witnesses] are the two olive trees and the two lampstands which stand before the Lord of the earth. 















###### 5 







And if anyone wants to harm them, fire comes out of their mouth and devours their enemies; so if anyone wants to harm them, he must be killed in this way. 















###### 6 







These [two witnesses] have the power [from God] to shut up the sky, so that no rain will fall during the days of their prophesying [regarding judgment and salvation]; and they have power over the waters (seas, rivers) to turn them into blood, and to strike the earth with every [kind of] plague, as often as they wish. 















###### 7 







When they have finished their testimony _and_ given their evidence, the beast that comes up out of the abyss (bottomless pit) will wage war with them, and overcome them and kill them. 















###### 8 







And their dead bodies _will lie exposed_ in the open street of the great city (Jerusalem), which in a spiritual sense is called [by the symbolic and allegorical names of] Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified. 















###### 9 







Those from the peoples and tribes and languages and nations [^d]look at their dead bodies for three and a half days, and will not allow their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb. 















###### 10 







And those [non-believers] who live on the earth will gloat over them and rejoice; and they will send gifts [in celebration] to one another, because these two prophets tormented _and_ troubled those who live on the earth. 















###### 11 







But after three and a half days, the breath of life from God came into them, and they stood on their feet; and great fear _and_ panic fell on those who were watching them. 















###### 12 







And the two witnesses heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, "Come up here." Then they ascended into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies watched them. 















###### 13 







And in that [very] hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell _and_ was destroyed; seven thousand [^e]people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest [who survived] were overcome with terror, and [^f]they glorified the God of heaven [as they recognized His awesome power]. 















###### 14 







The second woe is past; behold, the third woe is coming quickly. ## The Seventh Trumpet--Christ's Reign Foreseen 















###### 15 







Then the seventh angel sounded [his trumpet]; and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, "The kingdom (dominion, rule) of the world has become _the kingdom_ of our Lord and of His Christ; and He will reign forever and ever." 















###### 16 







And the twenty-four elders, who sit on their thrones before God, fell face downward and worshiped God, 















###### 17 







saying, "To You we give thanks, O Lord God Almighty [the Omnipotent, the Ruler of all], Who are and Who were, because You have taken Your great power _and_ the sovereignty [which is rightly Yours] and have [now] begun to reign. 















###### 18 







And the nations (Gentiles) became enraged, and Your wrath _and_ indignation came, and the time came for the dead to be judged, and [the time came] to reward Your bond-servants the prophets and the saints (God's people) and those who fear Your name, the small and the great, and [the time came] to destroy the destroyers of the earth." 















###### 19 







And the temple of God which is in heaven was opened; and the ark of His covenant appeared in His temple, and there were flashes of lightning, loud rumblings and peals of thunder and an earthquake and a great hailstorm. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: Revelation 11:1 The Greek corresponds to a Hebrew verb meaning “to stand” or “arise” which can be an instruction to prepare to fulfill a command, somewhat similar to the military command “attention.” [^c]: Revelation 11:3 See note 6:12. [^d]: Revelation 11:9 In Revelation John sometimes uses the present tense to refer vividly to the future. [^e]: Revelation 11:13 Lit _names of people_. [^f]: Revelation 11:13 These give glory out of servile fear, not worship from the heart.

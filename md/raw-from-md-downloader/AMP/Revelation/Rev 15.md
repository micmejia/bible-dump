# Revelation 15

***
















###### 1 







Then I saw another sign in heaven, great and wonderful [a warning of terrifying and horrible events]: seven angels who had seven plagues (afflictions, calamities), _which are_ the last, because with them the wrath of God is finished [that is, it is completely expressed and reaches its zenith]. 















###### 2 







Then I saw something like a sea _or_ large expanse of glass mixed with fire, and those who were victorious over the beast and over his image and over the number corresponding to his name were standing on the sea _or_ large expanse of glass, holding harps of God [worshiping Him]. 















###### 3 







And they [^a]sang the song of Moses, the bond-servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, "Great and wonderful _and_ awe-inspiring are Your works [in judgment], O Lord God, the Almighty [the Omnipotent, the Ruler of all]; Righteous and true are Your ways, O King of the [^b]nations! 















###### 4 







"Who will not fear [reverently] and glorify Your name, O Lord [giving You honor and praise in worship]? For You alone are holy; For all the nations shall come and worship before You, For Your righteous acts [Your just decrees and judgments] have been revealed _and_ displayed." 















###### 5 







After these things I looked, and the temple (sanctuary) of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened, 















###### 6 







and the seven angels who had the seven plagues (afflictions, calamities) came out of the temple, arrayed in linen, pure _and_ gleaming, and wrapped around their chests were golden sashes. 















###### 7 







Then one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath _and_ indignation of God, who lives forever and ever. 















###### 8 







And the temple was filled with [^c]smoke from the glory _and_ radiance _and_ splendor of God and from His power; and no one was able to enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

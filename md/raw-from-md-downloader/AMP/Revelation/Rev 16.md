# Revelation 16

***
















###### 1 







Then I heard a loud voice from the temple, saying to the seven angels, "Go and pour out on the earth the seven bowls of the wrath _and_ indignation of God." 















###### 2 







So the first _angel_ went and poured out his bowl on the earth; and loathsome and malignant sores came on the people who had the mark of the beast and who worshiped his image. 















###### 3 







The second _angel_ poured out his bowl into the sea, and it turned into blood like that of a corpse [foul and disgusting]; and every living [^a]thing in the sea died. 















###### 4 







Then the third _angel_ poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of water; and they turned into blood. 















###### 5 







And I heard the angel of the waters saying, "Righteous _and_ just are You, Who are and Who were, O Holy One, because You judged these things; 















###### 6 







for they have poured out the blood of the saints (God's people) and the prophets, and You [in turn] have given them blood to drink. They deserve Your judgment." 















###### 7 







And I heard [another from] the altar saying, "Yes, O Lord God, the Almighty [the Omnipotent, the Ruler of all], Your judgments are true and fair _and_ righteous." 















###### 8 







Then the fourth _angel_ poured out his bowl on the sun, and it was given power to scorch humanity with [raging] fire. 















###### 9 







People were [severely] burned by the great heat; and they reviled the name of God who has power over these plagues, but they did not repent [of their sin] and glorify Him. 















###### 10 







Then the fifth _angel_ poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and his kingdom was plunged into darkness; and people gnawed their tongues because of the pain [of their excruciating anguish and severe torment], 















###### 11 







and they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their anguish and their sores (abscesses, boils); and they did not repent of what they had done _nor_ hate their wickedness. 















###### 12 







Then the sixth _angel_ poured out his bowl on the great river, the Euphrates; and its water was dried up, so that the way would be prepared for [the coming of] the kings from [^b]the east. ## Armageddon 















###### 13 







And I saw three loathsome spirits like frogs, _leaping_ from the mouth of the dragon (Satan) and from the mouth of the beast (Antichrist, dictator) and from the mouth of the false prophet; 















###### 14 







for they are [actually] the spirits of demons, performing [miraculous] signs. And they go out to the kings of the entire inhabited earth, to gather them together for the war of the great day of God, the Almighty. 















###### 15 







**(**"Behold, I am coming like a thief. [^c]Blessed is he who [^d]stays awake and who keeps his clothes [that is, stays spiritually ready for the Lord's return], so that he will not be naked--spiritually unprepared--and men will not see his shame."**)** 















###### 16 







And they (demons) gathered the kings and armies of the world together at the place which in Hebrew is called [^e]Har-Magedon (Armageddon). ## Seventh Bowl of Wrath 















###### 17 







Then the seventh _angel_ poured out his bowl into the air, and a loud voice came out of the temple from the throne [of God], saying, "It is done. [It is all over, it is all accomplished, it has come.]" 















###### 18 







And there were flashes of lightning and loud rumblings and peals of thunder; and there was a massive earthquake--nothing like it has ever occurred since mankind originated on the earth, so severe and far-reaching was that earthquake. 















###### 19 







The great city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. And God kept in mind Babylon the great, to give her the cup of the wine of His fierce _and_ furious wrath. 















###### 20 







Then every island fled away, and no mountains could be found. 















###### 21 







And giant hailstones, as heavy as a [^f]talent, fell from the sky on the people; and people reviled _and_ spoke abusively of God for the plague of the hail, because the plague was so very great. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: Revelation 16:12 Lit _the rising sun_. Using this phrase, or just _the rising_, was the ancient way of referring to the east. A dry Euphrates would enable massive armies to travel quickly from the region of Iraq (Babylonia) to territory north of Israel (Syria) in preparation for the battle at Har-Magedon (v 16). [^c]: Revelation 16:15 This is the third of the seven promised blessings. See note 1:3. [^d]: Revelation 16:15 These are metaphorical statements referring to a believer who is always expecting the return of Christ, and maintains a lifestyle (the _clothing_) of which he will not be ashamed when that day comes. [^e]: Revelation 16:16 The name means “mountain of Megiddo” and indicates a region west and slightly south of the Sea of Galilee. [^f]: Revelation 16:21 A talent weighs about a hundred pounds.

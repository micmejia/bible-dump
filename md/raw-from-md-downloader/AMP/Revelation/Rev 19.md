# Revelation 19

***
















###### 1 







After these [^a]things I heard something like the great _and_ mighty shout of a vast multitude in heaven, [^b]exclaiming, "Hallelujah! Salvation and glory (splendor, majesty) and power (dominion, might) belong to our God; 















###### 2 







because His judgments are true and righteous. He has judged [convicted and pronounced sentence on] the great prostitute (idolatress) who was corrupting _and_ ruining _and_ poisoning the earth with her adultery (idolatry), and He has imposed the penalty for the blood of His bond-servants [^c]on her." 















###### 3 







And a second time they said, "Hallelujah! Her smoke shall ascend forever and ever." 















###### 4 







Then the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures also fell down and worshiped God who sits on the throne, saying, "Amen. Hallelujah (praise the Lord)!" 















###### 5 







Then from the throne there came a voice, saying, "Praise our God, all you bond-servants of His, you who fear Him, the small (common) and the great (distinguished)." ## Marriage of the Lamb 















###### 6 







Then I heard _something_ like the shout of a vast multitude, and like the boom of many pounding waves, and like the roar of mighty peals of thunder, saying, "Hallelujah! For the Lord our God, the Almighty, [the Omnipotent, the Ruler of all] reigns. 















###### 7 







Let us rejoice and shout for joy! Let us give Him glory _and_ honor, for the marriage of the Lamb has come [at last] and His bride (the redeemed) has prepared herself." 















###### 8 







She has been permitted to dress in fine linen, dazzling white and clean--for the fine linen signifies the righteous acts of the saints [the ethical conduct, personal integrity, moral courage, and godly character of believers]. 















###### 9 







Then the angel said to me, "Write, '[^d]Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the [^e]Lamb.'" And he said to me [further], "These are the true _and_ exact words of God." 















###### 10 







Then I fell down at his feet to worship him, but he [stopped me and] said to me, "You must not do that; I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers and sisters who have _and_ hold the testimony of Jesus. Worship God [alone]. For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy [His life and teaching are the heart of prophecy]." ## The Coming of Christ the Conqueror 















###### 11 







And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and He who was riding it is called Faithful and True (trustworthy, loyal, incorruptible, steady), and in righteousness He judges and wages war [on the rebellious nations]. 















###### 12 







His eyes are a flame of fire, and on His head are many royal crowns; and He has a name inscribed [on Him] which no one knows _or_ understands except Himself. 















###### 13 







He is dressed in a robe dipped in [^f]blood, and His name is called The Word of God. 















###### 14 







And the armies of heaven, dressed in fine linen, [dazzling] white and clean, followed Him on white horses. 















###### 15 







From His mouth comes a sharp sword (His word) with which He may strike down the nations, and He will [^g]rule them with a rod of iron; and He will tread the wine press of the fierce wrath of God, the Almighty [in judgment of the rebellious world]. 















###### 16 







And on His robe and on His thigh He has a name inscribed, "KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS." ## Doom of the Beast and False Prophet 















###### 17 







Then I saw a single angel standing in the sun, and with a loud voice he shouted to all the birds that fly in midheaven, saying, "Come, gather together for the great supper of God, 















###### 18 







so that you may feast on the flesh of kings, the flesh of commanders, the flesh of powerful _and_ mighty men, the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them, and the flesh of all humanity, both free men and slaves, both small and great [in a complete conquest of evil]." 















###### 19 







Then I saw the beast and the kings _and_ political leaders of the earth with their armies gathered to make war against Him who is mounted on the [white] horse and against His army. 















###### 20 







And the beast (Antichrist) was seized _and_ overpowered, and with him the false prophet who, in his presence, had performed [amazing] signs by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image; these two were hurled alive into the lake of fire which blazes with brimstone. 















###### 21 







And the rest were killed with the sword which came from the mouth of Him who sat on the horse, and all the birds fed ravenously _and_ gorged themselves with their flesh. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

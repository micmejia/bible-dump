# Revelation 22

***
















###### 1 







Then the angel showed me a river of the water of life, clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb (Christ), 















###### 2 







in the middle of its street. On either side of the river was the tree of life, bearing twelve _kinds of_ fruit, yielding its fruit every month; and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. 















###### 3 







There will no longer exist anything that is cursed [because sin and illness and death are gone]; and the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and His bond-servants will serve _and_ worship Him [with great awe and joy and loving devotion]; 















###### 4 







they will [be privileged to] see His face, and His name will be on their foreheads. 















###### 5 







And there will no longer be night; they have no need for lamplight or sunlight, because the Lord God will illumine them; and they will reign [as kings] forever and ever. ## You Are Invited to be Blessed 















###### 6 







Then he said to me, "These words are faithful and true." And the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent His angel [as a representative] to show His bond-servants the things that must soon take place. 















###### 7 







"And behold, I am coming quickly. [^a]Blessed (happy, prosperous, to be admired) is the one who heeds _and_ takes to heart _and_ remembers the words of the prophecy [that is, the predictions, consolations, and warnings] contained in this book (scroll)." 















###### 8 







I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. And when I heard and saw them, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who showed me these things. 















###### 9 







But he said to me, "Do not do that. I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers the prophets and with those who heed _and_ remember [the truths contained in] the words of this book. Worship God." 















###### 10 







And he said to me, "Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time [of their fulfillment] is [^b]near. 















###### 11 







Let the one who does wrong, still do wrong; and the one who is filthy (vile, impure), still be filthy; and the one who is righteous (just, upright), still be righteous; and the one who is holy, still be holy." 















###### 12 







"Behold, I (Jesus) am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, [^c]to give to each one [^d]according to the merit of his deeds (earthly works, faithfulness). 















###### 13 







I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End [the Eternal One]." 















###### 14 







[^e]Blessed (happy, prosperous, to be admired) are those who wash their robes [in the blood of Christ by believing and trusting in Him--the righteous who do His commandments], so that they may have the right to the tree of life, and may enter by the gates into the city. 















###### 15 







Outside are the dogs [the godless, the impure, those of low moral character] and the sorcerers [with their intoxicating drugs, and magic arts], and the immoral persons [the perverted, the molesters, and the adulterers], and the murderers, and the idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices lying (deception, cheating). ## The Final Invitation 















###### 16 







"I, Jesus, have sent My angel to testify to you _and_ to give you assurance of these things for the churches. I am the Root (the Source, the Life) and the Offspring of David, the radiant _and_ bright Morning Star." 















###### 17 







The [Holy] Spirit and the bride (the church, believers) say, "Come." And let the one who hears say, "Come." And let the one who is thirsty come; let the one who wishes take _and_ drink the water of life without cost. 















###### 18 







I testify _and_ warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book [its predictions, consolations, and admonitions]: if anyone adds [anything] to them, God will add to him the plagues (afflictions, calamities) which are written in this book; 















###### 19 







and if anyone takes away from _or_ distorts the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away [from that one] his share from the tree of life and from the holy city (new Jerusalem), which are written in this book. 















###### 20 







He who testifies _and_ affirms these things says, "Yes, I am coming quickly." Amen. Come, Lord Jesus. 















###### 21 







The grace of the Lord Jesus (the Christ, the Messiah) be with all [the saints--all believers, those set apart for God]. Amen. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

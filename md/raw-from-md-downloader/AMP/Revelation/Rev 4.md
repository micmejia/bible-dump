# Revelation 4

***
















###### 1 







After this I looked, and behold, [^a]a door standing open in heaven! And the first voice which I had heard, like _the sound_ of a [war] trumpet speaking with me, said, "Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after these things." 















###### 2 







At once I was in [special communication with] the Spirit; and behold, a throne stood in heaven, with One seated on the throne. 















###### 3 







And He who sat there appeared like [the crystalline sparkle of] [^b]a jasper stone and [the fiery redness of] a sardius stone, and encircling the throne _there was_ a rainbow that looked like [the color of an] emerald. 















###### 4 







Twenty-four [other] thrones surrounded the throne; and seated on these thrones were [^c]twenty-four elders dressed in white clothing, with crowns of gold on their heads. ## The Throne and Worship of the Creator 















###### 5 







From the throne came flashes of lightning and [rumbling] sounds and peals of thunder. Seven lamps of fire were burning in front of the throne, which are [^d]the seven Spirits of God; 















###### 6 







and in front of the throne _there was something_ like a sea _or_ large expanse of glass, like [the clearest] crystal. In the center and around the throne were four living [^e]creatures who were full of eyes in front and behind [seeing everything and knowing everything that is around them]. 















###### 7 







[^f]The first living creature was like a lion, the second creature like a calf (ox), the third creature had the face of a man, and the fourth creature was like a flying eagle. 















###### 8 







And the four living creatures, each one of them having six wings, are full of eyes all over and within [underneath their wings]; and day and night they never stop saying, "Holy, holy, holy [is the] Lord God, the Almighty [the Omnipotent, the Ruler of all], who was and who is and who is to come [the unchanging, eternal God]." 















###### 9 







Whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanksgiving to Him who sits on the throne, to Him who lives forever and ever, 















###### 10 







the twenty-four elders fall down before Him who sits on the throne, and they worship Him who lives forever and ever; and they throw down their crowns before the throne, saying,

[^b]: Revelation 4:3 In antiquity this name was given to various kinds and colors of precious stones, while the _sardius_ was a reddish stone. The gems are indicative of royalty. [^c]: Revelation 4:4 The twenty-four elders may indicate the twelve tribes of Israel together with the twelve apostles, representing redeemed humanity. Others say the twenty-four may be an angelic order of worship akin to the Aaronic priests. [^d]: Revelation 4:5 See note 1:4. [^e]: Revelation 4:6 Some scholars identify these creatures as cherubim glorifying God and guarding the throne of heaven; others suggest the creatures represent Godâ€™s attributes (especially His omniscience and omnipresence). [^f]: Revelation 4:7 Jewish tradition suggests that during the exodus the four standards of the tribal triads depicted these images: the triad led by Judah, the lion; the triad led by Reuben, the man; the triad led by Ephraim, the ox; the triad led by Dan, the eagle.

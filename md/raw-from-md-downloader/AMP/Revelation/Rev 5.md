# Revelation 5

***
















###### 1 







I saw in the right hand of Him who was seated on the throne a scroll written on the inside and on the back, closed _and_ sealed with seven seals. 















###### 2 







And I saw a strong angel announcing with a loud voice, "Who is worthy [having the authority and virtue] to open the scroll and to [^a]break its seals?" 















###### 3 







And no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth [in Hades, the realm of the dead] was able to open the scroll or look into it. 















###### 4 







And I _began_ to weep greatly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or look into it. 















###### 5 







Then one of the [twenty-four] elders said to me, "Stop weeping! Look closely, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome _and_ conquered! He can open the scroll and [break] its seven seals." 















###### 6 







And there [^b]between the throne **(**with the four living creatures**)** and among the elders I saw a Lamb (Christ) standing, [bearing scars and wounds] as though it had been slain, with seven horns (complete power) and with seven eyes (complete knowledge), which are [^c]the seven Spirits of God who have been sent [on duty] into all the earth. 















###### 7 







And He came and [^d]took the scroll from the right hand of Him who sat on the throne. 















###### 8 







And when He had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb (Christ), each one holding a harp and golden bowls full of fragrant incense, which are the prayers of the saints (God's people). 















###### 9 







And they sang a new song [of glorious redemption], saying, "Worthy _and_ deserving are You to take the scroll and to break its seals; for You were slain (sacrificed), and with Your blood You purchased _people_ for God from every tribe and language and people and nation. 















###### 10 







"You have made them to be a kingdom [of royal subjects] and priests to our God; and they will reign on the earth." ## Angels Exalt the Lamb 















###### 11 







Then I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne and [the voice] of the living creatures and the elders; and they numbered myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands (innumerable), 















###### 12 







saying in a loud voice, "Worthy _and_ deserving is the Lamb that was sacrificed to receive power and riches and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing." 















###### 13 







And I heard every created thing that is in heaven or on earth or under the earth [in Hades, the realm of the dead] or on the sea, and everything that is in them, saying [together], "To Him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb (Christ), be blessing and honor and glory and dominion forever and ever." 















###### 14 







And the four living creatures kept saying, "Amen." And the elders fell down and worshiped [Him who lives forever and ever]. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: Revelation 5:6 The Lamb is Jesus Christ, who stands “between,” in other words both as one with God upon the throne and as one with humanity around the throne. [^c]: Revelation 5:6 See note 1:4. [^d]: Revelation 5:7 Lit _has taken_. This is the Greek perfect tense, which John sometimes uses to emphasize the lasting significance of an action or event.

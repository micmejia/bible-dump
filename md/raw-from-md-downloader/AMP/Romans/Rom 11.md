# Romans 11

***
















###### 1 







I say then, has God rejected _and_ disowned His people? Certainly not! For I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. 















###### 2 







God has not rejected His [chosen] people whom He foreknew. Or do you not know what the Scripture says of Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel? 















###### 3 







"Lord, they have killed Your prophets, they have torn down Your altars, and I alone am left [of the prophets], and they are seeking my life." 















###### 4 







But what is God's response to him? "I have kept for Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal." 















###### 5 







So too then, at the present time there has come to be a remnant [a small believing minority] according to _God's_ gracious choice. 















###### 6 







But if it is by grace [God's unmerited favor], it is no longer on the basis of works, otherwise grace is no longer grace [it would not be a gift but a reward for works]. 















###### 7 







What then? Israel failed to obtain what it was seeking [that is, God's favor by obedience to the Law], but the elect [those chosen few] obtained it, while the rest of them became hardened _and_ callously indifferent; 















###### 8 







just as it is written [in Scripture], "God gave them a spirit of stupor, Eyes that do not see and ears that do not hear, [a spiritual apathy that has continued] to this very day." 















###### 9 







And David says, "Let their table (abundance) become a snare and a trap, A stumbling block and a retribution to them. 















###### 10 







"Let their eyes be darkened so that they do not see, And make their backs bend [under their burden] forever." 















###### 11 







So I say, have they stumbled so as to fall [to spiritual ruin]? Certainly not! But by their transgression [their rejection of the Messiah] salvation _has come_ to the Gentiles, to make Israel jealous [when they realize what they have forfeited]. 















###### 12 







Now if Israel's transgression means riches for the world [at large] and their failure means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their fulfillment _and_ reinstatement be! 















###### 13 







But _now_ I am speaking to you who are Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry, 















###### 14 







in the hope of somehow making my fellow countrymen jealous [by stirring them up so that they will seek the truth] and _perhaps_ save some of them. 















###### 15 







For if their [present] rejection [of salvation] is for the reconciliation of the world [to God], what will their acceptance [of salvation] be but [nothing less than] life from the dead? 















###### 16 







If the first portion [of dough offered as the first fruits] is holy, so is the _whole_ batch; and if the root (Abraham, the patriarchs) is holy, so are the branches (the Israelites). 















###### 17 







But if some of the branches were broken off, and you [Gentiles], being like a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among them to share with them the rich root of the olive tree, 















###### 18 







do not boast over the [broken] branches _and_ exalt yourself at their expense. If you do boast _and_ feel superior, _remember that_ it is not you who supports the root, but the root that _supports_ you. 















###### 19 







You will say then, "Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in." 















###### 20 







That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand by your faith [as believers understanding the truth of Christ's deity]. Do not be conceited, but [rather stand in great awe of God and] fear [Him]; 















###### 21 







for if God did not spare the natural branches [because of unbelief], He will not spare you either. 















###### 22 







Then appreciate the gracious kindness and the severity of God: to those who fell [into spiritual ruin], severity, but to you, God's _gracious_ kindness--if you continue in His kindness [by faith and obedience to Him]; otherwise you too will be cut off. 















###### 23 







And even they [the unbelieving Jews], if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in; for God has the power to graft them in again. 















###### 24 







For if you were cut off from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and against nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much easier will it be to graft these who are the natural _branches_ back into [the original parent stock of] their own olive tree? 















###### 25 







I do not want you, believers, to be unaware of this mystery [God's previously hidden plan]--so that you will not be wise in your own opinion--that a partial hardening has [temporarily] happened to Israel [to last] until the full number of the Gentiles has come in; 















###### 26 







and so [at that time] all Israel [that is, all Jews who have a personal faith in Jesus as Messiah] will be saved; just as it is written [in Scripture], "The Deliverer (Messiah) will come from Zion, He will remove ungodliness from Jacob." 















###### 27 







"This is My covenant with them, When I take away their sins." 















###### 28 







From the standpoint of the gospel, the Jews [at present] are enemies [of God] for your sake [which is for your benefit], but from the standpoint of God's choice [of the Jews as His people], they are still loved by Him for the sake of the fathers. 















###### 29 







For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable [for He does not withdraw what He has given, nor does He change His mind about those to whom He gives His grace or to whom He sends His call]. 















###### 30 







Just as you once were disobedient _and_ failed to listen to God, but have now obtained mercy because of their disobedience, 















###### 31 







so they too have now become disobedient so that they too may one day receive mercy because of the mercy shown to you. 















###### 32 







For God has imprisoned all in disobedience so that He may show mercy to all [Jew and Gentile alike]. 















###### 33 







Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments _and_ decisions and how unfathomable _and_ untraceable are His ways! 















###### 34 







For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been His counselor? 















###### 35 







Or who has first given to Him that it would be paid back to him? 















###### 36 







For from Him [all things originate] and through Him [all things live and exist] and to Him are all things [directed]. To Him be glory _and_ honor forever!

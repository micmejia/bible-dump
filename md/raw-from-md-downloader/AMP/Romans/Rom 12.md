# Romans 12

***
















###### 1 







[^a]Therefore I urge you, [^b]brothers and sisters, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies [dedicating all of yourselves, set apart] as a living sacrifice, holy and well-pleasing to God, _which is_ your rational (logical, intelligent) act of worship. 















###### 2 







And do not be conformed to this world [any longer with its superficial values and customs], but be [^c]transformed _and_ progressively changed [as you mature spiritually] by the renewing of your mind [focusing on godly values and ethical attitudes], so that you may prove [for yourselves] what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect [in His plan and purpose for you]. 















###### 3 







For by the grace [of God] given to me I say to everyone of you not to think more highly of himself [and of his importance and ability] than he ought to think; but to think so as to have sound judgment, as God has apportioned to each a degree of faith [and a purpose designed for service]. 















###### 4 







For just as in one [physical] body we have many parts, and these parts do not all have the same function _or_ special use, 















###### 5 







so we, who are many, are [nevertheless just] one body in Christ, and individually [we are] parts one of another [mutually dependent on each other]. 















###### 6 







Since we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, _each of us is to use them accordingly_: if [someone has the gift of] prophecy, [let him speak a new message from God to His people] in proportion to the faith _possessed_; 















###### 7 







if service, in the act of serving; or he who teaches, in the act of teaching; 















###### 8 







or he who encourages, in the act of encouragement; he who gives, with generosity; he who leads, [^d]with diligence; he who shows mercy [in caring for others], with cheerfulness. 















###### 9 







Love is to be sincere _and_ active [the real thing--without guile and hypocrisy]. Hate what is evil [detest all ungodliness, do not tolerate wickedness]; hold on tightly to what is good. 















###### 10 







Be devoted to one another with [authentic] brotherly affection [as members of one family], give preference to one another in honor; 















###### 11 







never lagging behind in diligence; aglow in the Spirit, _enthusiastically_ serving the Lord; 















###### 12 







_constantly_ rejoicing in hope [because of our confidence in Christ], steadfast _and_ patient in distress, devoted to prayer [continually seeking wisdom, guidance, and strength], 















###### 13 







contributing to the needs of God's people, pursuing [the practice of] hospitality. 















###### 14 







Bless those who persecute you [who cause you harm or hardship]; bless and do not curse [them]. 















###### 15 







Rejoice with those who rejoice [sharing others' joy], and weep with those who weep [sharing others' grief]. 















###### 16 







Live in harmony with one another; do not be haughty [conceited, self-important, exclusive], but associate with humble people [those with a realistic self-view]. Do not overestimate yourself. 















###### 17 







Never repay anyone evil for evil. Take thought for what is right _and_ gracious _and_ proper in the sight of everyone. 















###### 18 







If possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone. 















###### 19 







Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave the way open for God's wrath [and His judicial righteousness]; for it is written [in Scripture], "Vengeance is Mine, I will repay," says the Lord. 















###### 20 







But if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him a drink; for by doing this you will heap [^e]burning coals on his head." 















###### 21 







Do not be overcome _and_ conquered by evil, but overcome evil with good. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

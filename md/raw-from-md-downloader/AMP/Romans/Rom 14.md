# Romans 14

***
















###### 1 







As for the [^a]one whose faith is weak, accept him [into your fellowship], but not for [the purpose of] quarreling over his opinions. 















###### 2 







One man's faith permits him to eat everything, while the weak _believer_ eats _only_ vegetables [to avoid eating ritually unclean meat or something previously considered unclean]. 















###### 3 







The one who eats [everything] is not to look down on the one who does not eat, and the one who does not eat must not criticize _or_ pass judgment on the one who eats [everything], for God has accepted him. 















###### 4 







Who are you to judge the servant of another? Before his own master he stands [approved] or falls [out of favor]. And he [who serves the Master--the Lord] will stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand. 















###### 5 







One person regards one day as better [or more important] than another, while another regards every day [the same as any other]. Let everyone be fully convinced (assured, satisfied) in his own mind. 















###### 6 







He who observes the day, observes it for the Lord. He who eats, eats for the Lord, since he gives thanks to God; while he who abstains, abstains for the Lord and gives thanks to God. 















###### 7 







None of us lives for himself [for his own benefit, but for the Lord], and none of us dies for himself [but for the Lord]. 















###### 8 







If we live, we live for the Lord, and if we die, we die for the Lord. So then, whether we live or die, we are the Lord's. 















###### 9 







For Christ died and lived again for this reason, that He might be Lord of both the dead and the living. 















###### 10 







But you, why do you criticize your brother? Or you again, why do you look down on your [believing] brother _or_ regard him with contempt? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God [who alone is judge]. 















###### 11 







For it is written [in Scripture], "As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to Me, And every tongue shall give praise to God." 















###### 12 







So then, each of us will give an account of himself to God. 















###### 13 







Then let us not criticize one another anymore, but rather determine this--not to put an obstacle or a stumbling block _or_ a source of temptation in another believer's way. 















###### 14 







I know and am convinced [as one] in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean [ritually defiled, and unholy] in itself; but [nonetheless] it is unclean to anyone who thinks it is unclean. 















###### 15 







If your brother is being hurt _or_ offended because of food [that you insist on eating], you are no longer walking in love [toward him]. Do not let what you eat destroy _and_ spiritually harm one for whom Christ died. 















###### 16 







Therefore do not let what is a good thing for you [because of your freedom to choose] be spoken of as evil [by someone else]; 















###### 17 







for the kingdom of God is not _a matter of_ eating and drinking [what one likes], but of righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. 















###### 18 







For the one who serves Christ in this way [recognizing that food choice is secondary] is acceptable to God and is approved by men. 















###### 19 







So then, let us pursue [with enthusiasm] the things which make for peace and the building up of one another [things which lead to spiritual growth]. 















###### 20 







Do not, for the sake of food, tear down the work of God. All things indeed are [ceremonially] clean, but they are wrong for the person who eats and offends [another's conscience in the process]. 















###### 21 







It is good [to do the right thing and] not eat meat or drink wine, or do anything that offends your brother _and_ weakens him spiritually. 















###### 22 







The faith which you have [that gives you freedom of choice], have as your own conviction before God [just keep it between yourself and God, seeking His will]. Happy is he who has no reason to condemn himself for what he approves. 















###### 23 







But he who is uncertain [about eating a particular thing] is condemned if he eats, because he is not _acting_ from faith. Whatever is not from faith is sin [whatever is done with doubt is sinful]. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

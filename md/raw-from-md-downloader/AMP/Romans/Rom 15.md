# Romans 15

***
















###### 1 







Now we who are strong [in our convictions and faith] ought to [patiently] put up with the weaknesses of those who are not strong, and not just please ourselves. 















###### 2 







Let each one of us [make it a practice to] please his [^a]neighbor for his good, to build him up spiritually. 















###### 3 







For even Christ did not please Himself; but as it is written [in Scripture], "The reproaches of those who reproached You (the Father) fell on Me (the Son)." 















###### 4 







For whatever was written in earlier times was written for our instruction, so that through endurance and the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope _and_ overflow with confidence in His promises. 















###### 5 







Now may the God who gives endurance and who supplies encouragement grant that you be of the same mind with one another according to Christ Jesus, 















###### 6 







so that with one accord you may with one voice glorify _and_ praise _and_ honor the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. 















###### 7 







Therefore, [continue to] accept _and_ welcome one another, just as Christ has accepted _and_ welcomed us to the glory of [our great] God. 















###### 8 







For I tell you that Christ has become a servant _and_ a minister to the circumcision (Jews) on behalf of God's truth, to confirm _and_ verify the promises made to the fathers, 















###### 9 







and for the Gentiles to glorify God for His mercy [to them, since God had no covenant with them]. As it is written _and_ forever remains written, "Therefore I praise You among the Gentiles, And sing praises to Your name." 















###### 10 







Again it says, "Rejoice _and_ celebrate, O Gentiles, along with His people." 















###### 11 







And again, "Praise the Lord all you Gentiles, And let all the peoples praise Him!" 















###### 12 







Again Isaiah says, "There shall be a root of [^b]Jesse, He who arises to rule [as King] over the Gentiles, In Him shall the Gentiles hope." 















###### 13 







May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing [through the experience of your faith] that by the power of the Holy Spirit you will abound in hope _and_ overflow with confidence in His promises. 















###### 14 







Personally I am convinced about you, my brothers and sisters, that you yourselves are full of goodness, amply filled with all [spiritual] knowledge, and competent to admonish _and_ counsel _and_ instruct one another. 















###### 15 







Still, on some points I have written to you very boldly _and_ without reservation to remind you [about them] again, because of the grace that was given to me from God, 















###### 16 







to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles. I minister as a priest the gospel of God, in order that my offering of the Gentiles may become acceptable [to Him], sanctified [made holy and set apart for His purpose] by the Holy Spirit. 















###### 17 







In Christ Jesus, then, I have found [legitimate] reason for boasting in things related [to my service] to God. 















###### 18 







For I will not [even] presume to speak of anything except what Christ has done through me [as an instrument in His hands], resulting in the obedience of the Gentiles [to the gospel], by word and deed, 















###### 19 







with the power of signs and wonders, [and all of it] in the power of the Spirit. So [starting] from Jerusalem and as far _away_ as [^c]Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel [faithfully preaching the good news] of Christ [where it had not before been preached]. 















###### 20 







Accordingly I set a goal to preach the gospel, not where Christ's name was already known, so that I would not build on another man's foundation; 















###### 21 







but [instead I would act on this goal] as it is written [in Scripture], "They who had no news of Him shall see, And they who have not heard [of Him] shall understand." 















###### 22 







This [goal--my commitment to this principle] is the reason why I have often been prevented from coming to you [in Rome]. 















###### 23 







But now, with no further place for work in these regions, and since I have longed for many years to come to you-- 















###### 24 







whenever I go [on my trip] to Spain--I hope to see you as I pass through [Rome], and to be helped on my journey there by you, after I have first enjoyed your company for a little while. 















###### 25 







But for now, I am going to Jerusalem to serve the saints (Jewish believers). 















###### 26 







For [Gentile believers in] [^d]Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the saints (Jewish believers) in Jerusalem. 















###### 27 







They were pleased to do it, and they are indebted to them. For if the Gentiles have come to share in their spiritual things, then they are indebted to serve them also in [tangible] material things. 















###### 28 







Therefore, when I have finished this [mission] and have safely given to them what has been raised, I will go on by way of you to Spain. 















###### 29 







I know that when I do come to you, I will come in the abundant blessing of Christ. 















###### 30 







I urge you, believers, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to join together with me in your prayers to God in my behalf, 















###### 31 







[and pray] that I may be rescued from the unbelievers in Judea, and that my service for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints (Jewish believers) _there_; 















###### 32 







so that by God's will I may come to you with joy and find rest in your company. 















###### 33 







May the God of peace be with you all! Amen. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Romans 4

***
















###### 1 







What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather [^a]humanly speaking, has found? [Has he obtained a favored standing?] 















###### 2 







For if Abraham was justified [that is, acquitted from the guilt of his sins] by works [those things he did that were good], he has something to boast about, but not before God. 















###### 3 







For what does the Scripture say? "Abraham believed in (trusted, relied on) God, and it was credited to his account as righteousness (right living, right standing with God)." 















###### 4 







Now to a laborer, his wages are not credited as a favor _or_ a gift, but as an obligation [something owed to him]. 















###### 5 







But to the one who does not work [that is, the one who does not try to earn his salvation by doing good], but believes _and_ completely trusts in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is [^b]credited to him as righteousness (right standing with God). 















###### 6 







And in this same way David speaks of the blessing on the one to whom God credits righteousness apart from works: 















###### 7 







"Blessed _and_ happy _and_ favored are those whose lawless acts have been forgiven, And whose sins have been covered up _and_ completely buried. 















###### 8 







"Blessed _and_ happy _and_ favored is the man whose sin the Lord will not take into account _nor_ charge against him." 















###### 9 







Is this blessing only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? For we say, "Faith was credited to Abraham as righteousness." 















###### 10 







How then was it credited [to him]? Was it after he had been circumcised, or before? Not after, but while [he was] uncircumcised. 















###### 11 







He received the sign of circumcision, a seal _or_ confirmation of the righteousness which he had by faith while [he was still] uncircumcised--this was so that he would be the [spiritual] father of all who believe without being circumcised--so that righteousness would be credited to them, 















###### 12 







and [that he would be] the [spiritual] father of those circumcised who are not only circumcised, but who also walk in the steps of the faith of our father Abraham which he had before he was circumcised. 















###### 13 







For the promise to Abraham or to his descendants that he would be heir of the world was not through [observing the requirements of] the Law, but through the righteousness of faith. 















###### 14 







If those who are [followers] of the Law are [the true] heirs [of Abraham], then faith [leading to salvation] is of no effect _and_ void, and the promise [of God] is nullified. 















###### 15 







For the Law results in [God's] wrath [against sin], but where there is no law, there is no violation [of it either]. 















###### 16 







Therefore, [inheriting] the promise depends entirely on faith [that is, confident trust in the unseen God], in order that _it may be given_ as an act of grace [His unmerited favor and mercy], so that the promise will be [legally] guaranteed to all the descendants [of Abraham]--not only for those [Jewish believers] who keep the Law, but also for those [Gentile believers] who share the faith of Abraham, who is the [spiritual] father of us all-- 















###### 17 







**(**as it is written [in Scripture], "I have made you a father of many nations"**)** in the sight of Him in whom he believed, that is, God [^c]who gives life to the dead and calls into being that which does not exist. 















###### 18 







In hope against hope Abraham believed that he would become a father of many nations, as he had been promised [by God]: "So [numberless] shall your descendants be." 















###### 19 







Without becoming weak in faith he considered his own body, now as good as dead [for producing children] since he was about a hundred years old, and [he considered] the deadness of Sarah's womb. 















###### 20 







But he did not doubt _or_ waver in unbelief concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong _and_ empowered by faith, giving glory to God, 















###### 21 







being fully convinced that God had the power to do what He had promised. 















###### 22 







Therefore his faith was credited to him as righteousness (right standing with God). 















###### 23 







Now not for his sake alone was it written that it was credited to him, 















###### 24 







but for our sake also--to whom righteousness will be credited, as those who believe in Him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead-- 















###### 25 







who was betrayed _and_ crucified because of our sins, and was raised [from the dead] because of our justification [our acquittal--absolving us of all sin before God]. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

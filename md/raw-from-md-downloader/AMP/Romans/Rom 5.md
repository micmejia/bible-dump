# Romans 5

***
















###### 1 







Therefore, since we have been justified [that is, acquitted of sin, declared blameless before God] by faith, [let us grasp the fact that] we have peace with God [and the joy of reconciliation with Him] through our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed). 















###### 2 







Through Him we also have access by faith into this [remarkable state of] grace in which we [firmly and safely and securely] stand. Let us rejoice in our [^a]hope _and_ the confident assurance of [experiencing and enjoying] the glory of [our great] God [the manifestation of His excellence and power]. 















###### 3 







And not only _this_, but [with joy] let us exult in our sufferings _and_ rejoice in our hardships, knowing that hardship (distress, pressure, trouble) produces patient endurance; 















###### 4 







and endurance, proven character (spiritual maturity); and proven character, hope _and_ confident assurance [of eternal salvation]. 















###### 5 







Such hope [in God's promises] never disappoints _us_, because God's love has been abundantly poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us. 















###### 6 







While we were still helpless [powerless to provide for our salvation], at the right time Christ died [as a substitute] for the ungodly. 















###### 7 







Now it is an extraordinary thing for one to willingly give his life even for an upright man, though perhaps for a good man [one who is noble and selfless and worthy] someone might even dare to die. 















###### 8 







But God clearly shows _and_ proves His own love for us, by the fact that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. 















###### 9 







Therefore, since we have now been justified [declared free of the guilt of sin] by His blood, [how much more certain is it that] we will be saved from the [^b]wrath _of God_ through Him. 















###### 10 







For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, _it is_ much more _certain_, having been reconciled, that we will be saved [from the consequences of sin] by His life [that is, we will be saved because Christ lives today]. 















###### 11 







Not only that, but we also rejoice in God [rejoicing in His love and perfection] through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received _and_ enjoy our reconciliation [with God]. 















###### 12 







Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, so death spread to all people [no one being able to stop it or escape its power], because they all sinned. 















###### 13 







Sin was [committed] in the world before the Law [was given], but sin is not charged [against anyone] when there is no law [against it]. 















###### 14 







Yet death ruled [over mankind] from Adam to Moses [the Lawgiver], even over those who had not sinned [^c]as Adam did. Adam is a type of Him (Christ) who was to come [but in reverse--Adam brought destruction, Christ brought salvation]. 















###### 15 







But the free gift [of God] is not like the trespass [because the gift of grace overwhelms the fall of man]. For if many died by one man's trespass [Adam's sin], much more [abundantly] did God's grace and the gift [that comes] by the grace of the one Man, Jesus Christ, overflow to [benefit] the many. 















###### 16 







Nor is the gift [of grace] like _that which came_ through the one who sinned. For on the one hand the judgment [following the sin] _resulted_ from one trespass and brought condemnation, but on the other hand the free gift _resulted_ from many trespasses and brought justification [the release from sin's penalty for those who believe]. 















###### 17 







For if by the trespass of the one (Adam), death reigned through the one (Adam), much more _surely_ will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness reign in [eternal] life through the One, Jesus Christ. 















###### 18 







So then as through one trespass [Adam's sin] there resulted condemnation for all men, even so through one act of righteousness there resulted justification of life to [^d]all men. 















###### 19 







For just as through one man's disobedience [his failure to hear, his carelessness] the many were made sinners, so through the obedience of the one Man the many will be made righteous _and_ acceptable to God _and_ brought into right standing with Him. 















###### 20 







But the Law came to increase _and_ expand [the awareness of] the trespass [by defining and unmasking sin]. But where sin increased, [God's remarkable, gracious gift of] grace [His unmerited favor] has surpassed it _and_ increased all the more, 















###### 21 







so that, as sin reigned in death, so also grace would reign through righteousness which brings eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

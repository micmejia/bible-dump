# Romans 7

***
















###### 1 







Or do you not know, [^a]brothers and sisters **(**for I am speaking to those who know the Law**)**, that the Law has jurisdiction [to rule] over a person as long as he lives? 















###### 2 







For the married woman [as an example] is bound _and_ remains bound by law to her husband while he lives; but if her husband dies, she is released _and_ exempt from the law concerning her husband. 















###### 3 







Accordingly, she will be designated as an adulteress if she [^b]unites herself to another man while her husband is alive. But if her husband dies, she is free from the law [regarding marriage], so that she is not an adulteress if she marries another man. 















###### 4 







Therefore, my [^c]fellow believers, you too died to the Law through the [crucified] body of Christ, so that you may belong to another, to Him who was raised from the dead, in order that we may bear fruit for God. 















###### 5 







When we were _living_ in the flesh [trapped by sin], the sinful passions, which were awakened by [that which] the Law [identifies as sin], were at work in our body to bear fruit for death [since the willingness to sin led to death and separation from God]. 















###### 6 







But now we have been released from the Law _and_ its penalty, having died [through Christ] to that by which we were held captive, so that we serve [God] in the newness of the Spirit and not in the oldness of the letter [of the Law]. 















###### 7 







What shall we say then? Is the Law sin? Certainly not! On the contrary, if it had not been for the Law, I would not have recognized sin. For I would not have known [for example] about coveting [what belongs to another, and would have had no sense of guilt] if the Law had not [repeatedly] said, "You shall not covet." 















###### 8 







But sin, finding an opportunity through the commandment [to express itself] produced in me every kind of coveting _and_ selfish desire. For without the Law sin is dead [the recognition of sin is inactive]. 















###### 9 







I was once alive without [knowledge of] the Law; but when the commandment came [and I understood its meaning], sin became alive and I died [since the Law sentenced me to death]. 















###### 10 







And the _very_ commandment which was intended to bring life, actually proved to bring death for me. 















###### 11 







For sin, seizing its opportunity through the commandment, beguiled _and_ completely deceived me, and [^d]using it as a weapon killed me [separating me from God]. 















###### 12 







So then, the Law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good. 















###### 13 







Did that which is good [the Law], then become death to me? Certainly not! But sin, in order that it might be revealed as sin, was producing death in me by [using] this good thing [as a weapon], so that through the commandment sin would become exceedingly sinful. ## The Conflict of Two Natures 















###### 14 







We know that the Law is spiritual, but I am _a creature_ of the flesh [worldly, self-reliant--carnal and unspiritual], sold into slavery to sin [and serving under its control]. 















###### 15 







For I do not understand my own actions [I am baffled and bewildered by them]. I do not practice what I want _to do_, but I am doing the very thing I hate [and yielding to my human nature, my worldliness--my sinful capacity]. 















###### 16 







Now if I _habitually_ do what I do not want to do, [that means] I agree with the Law, _confessing_ that it is good (morally excellent). 















###### 17 







So now [if that is the case, then] it is no longer I who do it [the disobedient thing which I despise], but the sin [nature] which lives in me. 















###### 18 







For I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my flesh [my human nature, my worldliness--my sinful capacity]. For the willingness [to do good] is present in me, but the doing of good is not. 















###### 19 







For the good that I want to do, I do not do, but I practice the very evil that I do not want. 















###### 20 







But if I am doing the very thing I do not want to do, I am no longer the one doing it [that is, it is not me that acts], but the sin [nature] which lives in me. 















###### 21 







So I find _it to be_ the law [of my inner self], that evil is present in me, the one who wants to do good. 















###### 22 







For I joyfully delight in the law of God in my inner self [with my new nature], 















###### 23 







but I see a different law _and_ rule of action in the members of my body [in its appetites and desires], waging war against the law of my mind _and_ subduing me and making me a prisoner of the law of sin which is within my members. 















###### 24 







Wretched _and_ miserable man that I am! Who will [rescue me and] set me free from this body of death [this corrupt, mortal existence]? 















###### 25 







Thanks be to God [for my deliverance] through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, on the one hand I myself with my mind serve the law of God, but on the other, with my flesh [my human nature, my worldliness, my sinful capacity--I serve] the law of sin. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Ruth 3

***
















###### 1 







Then Naomi her mother-in-law said to Ruth, "My daughter, shall I not look for [^a]security _and_ a home for you, so that it may be well with you? 















###### 2 







Now Boaz, with whose maids you were [working], is he not our relative? See now, he is winnowing barley at the threshing floor tonight. 















###### 3 







So wash and anoint yourself [with olive oil], then put on your [[^b]best] clothes, and go down to the threshing floor; [^c]but stay out of the man's sight until he has finished eating and drinking. 















###### 4 







When he lies down, notice the place where he is lying, and [^d]go and uncover his feet and lie down. Then he will tell you what to do." 















###### 5 







Ruth answered her, "I will do everything that you say." 















###### 6 







So she went down to the threshing floor and did just as her mother-in-law had told her. 















###### 7 







When Boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was happy, he went to lie down at the end of the stack of grain. Then Ruth came secretly, and uncovered his feet and lay down. 















###### 8 







In the middle of the night the man was startled and he turned over, and found a woman lying at his feet. 















###### 9 







So he said, "Who are you?" And she answered, "I am Ruth your maid. Spread the hem of your garment over me, for you are a close relative _and_ redeemer." 















###### 10 







Then he said, "May you be blessed by the LORD, my daughter. You have made your last kindness better than the first; for you have not gone after young men, whether poor or rich. 















###### 11 







Now, my daughter, do not be afraid. I will do for you whatever you ask, since all my people in the city know that you are a woman of excellence. 















###### 12 







It is true that I am your close relative _and_ redeemer; however, there is a relative closer [to you] than I. 















###### 13 







Spend the night [here], and in the morning if he will redeem you, fine; let him do it. But if he does not wish to redeem you, then, as the LORD lives, I will redeem you. Lie down until the morning." 















###### 14 







So she lay at his feet until the morning, but got up before anyone could recognize another; Boaz said, "[^e]Do not let it be known that the woman came to the threshing floor [last night]." 















###### 15 







He also said, "Give me the shawl you are wearing and hold it out." So Ruth held it and he measured out six measures of barley [into it] and placed it on her. And she went into the city. 















###### 16 







When she came home, her mother-in-law said, "How did it go, my daughter?" And Ruth told her everything that the man had done for her. 















###### 17 







She said, "He gave me these six measures of barley, and he said to me, 'Do not go back to your mother-in-law empty-handed.'" 















###### 18 







Then Naomi said, "Sit _and_ wait, my daughter, until you learn how this matter turns out; for the man will not rest until he has settled it today." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

The ancient rabbis understood it as an allegory of the relationship between God and Israel, and viewed the details as symbolic. [^b]: Song of Solomon 1:2 The parenthetical headings indicate that the speakers are not from the Hebrew text nor the Septuagint, but reflect an ancient tradition which appears in some manuscripts. [^c]: Song of Solomon 1:5 The purpose of the chorus is to echo and expand the sentiments of the bride and her bridegroom. The members of the chorus are not always known, but have been variously identified as “daughters of Jerusalem,” “daughters of Zion,” “ladies in waiting,” “friends” or “relatives” of the bride. [^d]: Song of Solomon 1:14 An oasis on the western side of the Dead Sea.

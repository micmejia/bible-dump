# Song of Solomon 2

***
















###### 1 







"I am the rose [of the plain] of Sharon, The lily of the valleys [that grows in deep places]." 















###### 2 







"Like the lily among the thorns, So are you, my darling, among the maidens." 















###### 3 







"Like an apple tree [rare and welcome] among the trees of the forest, So is my beloved among the young men! In his shade I took great delight and sat down, And his fruit was sweet _and_ delicious to my palate. 















###### 4 







"He has brought me to his banqueting place, And his banner over me is love [waving overhead to protect and comfort me]. 















###### 5 







"Sustain me with raisin cakes, Refresh me with apples, Because I am sick with love. 















###### 6 







"Let his left hand be under my head And his right hand embrace me." 















###### 7 







"I command that you take an oath, O daughters of Jerusalem, By the gazelles or by the does of the field [which run free], That you do not rouse nor awaken my love Until she pleases." 















###### 8 







"Listen! My beloved! Behold, he comes, Climbing on the mountains, Leaping _and_ running on the hills! 















###### 9 







"My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag. Behold, he is standing behind our wall, He is looking through the windows, He is gazing through the lattice. 















###### 10 







"My beloved speaks and says to me, 'Arise, my love, my fair one, And come away. 















###### 11 







'For behold, the winter is past, The rain is over and gone. 















###### 12 







'The flowers appear on the earth once again; The time for singing has come, And the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. 















###### 13 







'The fig tree has budded _and_ ripens her figs, And the vines are in blossom and give forth their fragrance. Arise, my love, my fair one, And come away [to climb the rocky steps of the hillside].'" 















###### 14 







"O my dove, [here] in the clefts in the rock, In the sheltered _and_ secret place of the steep pathway, Let me see your face, Let me hear your voice; For your voice is sweet, And your face is lovely." 















###### 15 







"Catch the foxes for us, The little foxes that spoil _and_ ruin the vineyards [of love], While our vineyards are in blossom." 















###### 16 







"My beloved is mine and I am his; He pastures _his flock_ among the lilies. 















###### 17 







"Until the cool of the day when the shadows flee away, Return quickly, my beloved, and be like a gazelle Or a young stag on the mountains of Bether [which separate us]." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Song of Solomon 4

***
















###### 1 







"How fair _and_ beautiful you are, my darling, How very beautiful! Your eyes behind your veil are like those of a dove; Your hair is like [the shimmering black fleece of] a flock of [Arabian] goats That have descended from Mount Gilead [beyond the Jordan]. 















###### 2 







"Your teeth are like a flock of _newly_ shorn ewes Which have come up from washing, All of which bear twins, And not one among them has lost her young. 















###### 3 







"Your lips are like a ribbon of scarlet, And your mouth is lovely. Your temples are like a slice of the pomegranate Behind your veil. 















###### 4 







"Your neck is like the tower of David, Built with rows of [glistening] stones, Whereon hang a thousand shields, All of them shields of warriors. 















###### 5 







"Your two breasts are like two fawns, Twins of a gazelle Which feed among the lilies. 















###### 6 







"Until the day breaks And the shadows flee away, [In my thoughts] I will go my way to the mountain of myrrh And to the hill of frankincense. 















###### 7 







"O my love, you are altogether beautiful _and_ fair. There is no flaw _nor_ blemish in you! 















###### 8 







"_Come away_ with me from Lebanon, my [promised] bride, May you come with me from Lebanon. Journey down from the top of Amana, From the summit of Senir and Hermon, From the dens of lions, From the mountains of leopards. 















###### 9 







"You have ravished my heart _and_ given me courage, my sister, my [promised] bride; You have ravished my heart _and_ given me courage with a single _glance_ of your eyes, With one jewel of your necklace. 















###### 10 







"How beautiful is your love, my sister, my [promised] bride! How much better is your love than wine, And the fragrance of your oils Than all _kinds_ of balsam _and_ spices. 















###### 11 







"Your lips, my [promised] bride, drip honey [as the honeycomb]; Honey and milk are under your tongue, And the fragrance of your garments is like the fragrance of Lebanon. 















###### 12 







"A garden enclosed is my sister, my [promised] bride-- A rock garden locked, a spring sealed up. 















###### 13 







"Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates, [A paradise] with precious fruits, henna with fragrant plants, 















###### 14 







Fragrant plants and saffron, calamus and cinnamon, With all trees of frankincense, Myrrh and aloes, along with all the finest spices. 















###### 15 







"_You are_ a fountain in a garden, A well of fresh _and_ living water, And streams _flowing_ from Lebanon." 















###### 16 







"Awake, O north _wind_, And come, south _wind_ [blow softly upon my garden]; Make my garden breathe out _fragrance_, [for the one in whom my soul delights], Let its spices flow forth. Let my beloved come into his garden And eat its choicest fruits." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

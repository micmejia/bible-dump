# Song of Solomon 5

***
















###### 1 







"I have come into my garden, my sister, my [promised] bride; I have gathered my myrrh along with my balsam _and_ spice [from your sweet words]. I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, friends; Drink and drink deeply, O lovers." 















###### 2 







"I was asleep, but my heart was awake. A voice [in my dream]! My beloved was knocking: 'Open to me, my sister, my darling, My dove, my perfect one! For my head is drenched with the [heavy night] dew; My hair [is covered] with the dampness of the night.' 















###### 3 







"I had taken off my dress, How can I put it on _again_? I had washed my feet, How could I get them dirty _again_? 















###### 4 







"My beloved extended his hand through the opening [of the door], And my feelings were aroused for him. 















###### 5 







"I arose to open for my beloved; And my hands dripped with myrrh, And my fingers with liquid [sweet-scented] myrrh, On the handles of the bolt. 















###### 6 







"I opened for my beloved, But my beloved had turned away and was gone. My heart went out _to him_ when he spoke. I searched for him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he did not answer me. 















###### 7 







"The watchmen who make the rounds in the city found me. They struck me, they wounded me; The guardsmen of the walls took my shawl from me. 















###### 8 







"I command that you take an oath, O daughters of Jerusalem, If you find my beloved, As to what you tell him-- [Say that] I am sick from love [sick from being without him]." 















###### 9 







"What is your beloved more than another beloved, O most beautiful among women? What is your beloved more than another beloved, That you should so command us to take an oath?" ## Admiration by the Bride 















###### 10 







"My beloved is exquisitely handsome and ruddy, Outstanding among ten thousand. 















###### 11 







"His head is _like_ [precious] gold, pure gold; His hair is [curly] _like_ clusters of dates And black as a raven. 















###### 12 







"His eyes are like doves Beside streams of water, Bathed in milk And reposed in their setting. 















###### 13 







"His cheeks are like a bed of balsam, Banks of sweet, fragrant herbs. His lips are lilies Dripping _sweet-scented_ myrrh. 















###### 14 







"His hands are rods of gold Set with beryl; His abdomen is a figure of carved ivory Inlaid with sapphires. 















###### 15 







"His legs are [strong and steady] pillars of alabaster Set upon pedestals of fine gold. His appearance is like Lebanon, Stately _and_ choice as the cedars. 















###### 16 







"His mouth is _full of_ sweetness; Yes, he is altogether lovely _and_ desirable. This is my beloved and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

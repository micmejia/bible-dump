# Song of Solomon 8

***
















###### 1 







"Oh, that you were like a brother to me, Who nursed at the breasts of my mother. If I found you out of doors, I would kiss you; No one would blame me _or_ despise me, either. 















###### 2 







"I would lead you and bring you Into the house of my mother, who used to instruct me; I would give you spiced wine to drink from the juice of my pomegranates. 















###### 3 







"Let his left hand be under my head And his right hand embrace me." 















###### 4 







"I command you to take an oath, O daughters of Jerusalem, That you do not rouse nor awaken my love Until she pleases." 















###### 5 







"Who is this coming up from the wilderness Leaning upon her beloved?" "Under the apple tree I awakened you [to my love]; There your mother was in labor with you, There she was in labor and gave you birth. 















###### 6 







"Put me like a seal on your heart, Like a seal on your arm; For love is as strong as death, Jealousy is as severe _and_ cruel as Sheol (the place of the dead). Its flashes are flashes of fire, [A most vehement flame] the very flame of the [^a]LORD! 















###### 7 







"Many waters cannot quench love, Nor can rivers drown it. If a man would offer all the riches of his house for love, It would be utterly scorned _and_ despised." 















###### 8 







"We have a little sister And she has no breasts. What shall we do for our sister On the day when she is spoken for [in marriage]? 















###### 9 







"If she is a wall (discreet, womanly), We will build on her a turret (dowry) of silver; But if she is a door (bold, flirtatious), We will enclose her with planks of cedar." 















###### 10 







"I was a wall, and my breasts were like the towers. Then I became in the king's eyes As one [to be respected and allowed] to find peace. 















###### 11 







"Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; He entrusted the vineyard to caretakers; Each one was to bring him a thousand _shekels_ of silver for its fruit. 















###### 12 







"My very own vineyard is at my disposal; The thousand [shekels of silver] are for you, O Solomon, And two hundred are for those who tend the fruit." 















###### 13 







"O you who sit in the gardens, My companions are listening for your voice-- Let me hear it." 















###### 14 







"Hurry, my beloved _and_ come quickly, Like a gazelle or a young stag [taking me home] On the mountains of spices." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

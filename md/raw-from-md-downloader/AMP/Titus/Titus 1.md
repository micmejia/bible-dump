# Titus 1

***
















###### 1 







Paul, a bond-servant of God and an apostle (special messenger, personally chosen representative) of Jesus Christ, for the faith of God's chosen ones and [to lead and encourage them to recognize and pursue] the knowledge of the truth which leads to godliness, 















###### 2 







based on the hope _and_ divine guarantee of eternal life, [the life] which God, who is ever truthful _and_ without deceit, promised before the ages of time began, 















###### 3 







and at the appointed time has made known His word _and_ revealed it as His message, through preaching, which was entrusted to me according to the command of God our Savior-- 















###### 4 







To Titus, my true child in a common faith: Grace and peace [inner calm and spiritual well-being] from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior. ## Qualifications of Elders 















###### 5 







For this reason I left you _behind_ in Crete, so that you would set right what remains _unfinished_, and appoint [^a]elders in every city as I directed you, 















###### 6 







_namely_, a man of unquestionable integrity, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, not accused of being immoral or rebellious. 















###### 7 







For the [^b]overseer, as God's steward, must be blameless, not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not addicted to wine, not violent, not greedy for dishonest gain [but financially ethical]. 















###### 8 







And _he must be_ hospitable [to believers, as well as strangers], a lover of what is good, sensible (upright), fair, devout, self-disciplined [above reproach--whether in public or in private]. 















###### 9 







He must hold firmly to the trustworthy word [of God] as it was taught to him, so that he will be able both to give accurate instruction in sound [reliable, error-free] doctrine and to refute those who contradict [it by explaining their error]. 















###### 10 







For there are many rebellious men who are empty talkers [just windbags] and deceivers; especially those of the circumcision [those Jews who insist that Gentile believers must be circumcised and keep the Law in order to be saved]. 















###### 11 







They must be silenced, because they are upsetting whole families by teaching things they should not teach for the purpose of dishonest _financial_ gain. 















###### 12 







One of them [Epimenides, a Cretan], a [^c]prophet of their own, said, "Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons." 















###### 13 







This description is true. So rebuke them sharply so that they will be sound in the faith _and_ free from doctrinal error, 















###### 14 







not paying attention to Jewish myths and the commandments _and_ rules of men who turn their backs on the truth. 















###### 15 







To the pure, all things are pure; but to the corrupt and unbelieving, nothing is pure; both their mind and their conscience are corrupted. 















###### 16 







They profess to know God [to recognize and be acquainted with Him], but by _their_ actions they deny _and_ disown Him. They are detestable and disobedient and worthless for good work of any kind. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Titus 2

***
















###### 1 







But as for you, teach the things which are in agreement with sound doctrine [which produces men and women of good character whose lifestyle identifies them as true Christians]. 















###### 2 







Older men are to be temperate, dignified, sensible, sound in faith, in love, in steadfastness [Christlike in character]. 















###### 3 







Older women similarly are to be reverent in their behavior, not malicious gossips nor addicted to much wine, teaching what is right _and_ good, 















###### 4 







so that they may encourage the young women to tenderly love their husbands and their children, 















###### 5 







to be sensible, pure, makers of a home [where God is honored], good-natured, being subject to their own husbands, so that the word of God will not be dishonored. 















###### 6 







In a similar way urge the young men to be sensible _and_ self-controlled _and_ to behave wisely [taking life seriously]. 















###### 7 







And in all things show yourself to be an example of good works, with purity in doctrine [having the strictest regard for integrity and truth], dignified, 















###### 8 







sound _and_ beyond reproach in instruction, so that the opponent [of the faith] will be shamed, having nothing bad to say about us. 















###### 9 







Urge bond-servants to be subject to their own masters in everything, to be pleasing and not talk back, 















###### 10 







not stealing [things, regardless of value], but proving themselves trustworthy, so that in every respect they will adorn _and_ do credit to the teaching of God our Savior. 















###### 11 







For the [remarkable, undeserved] grace of God that [^a]brings salvation has appeared to all men. 















###### 12 







It teaches us to reject ungodliness and worldly (immoral) desires, and to live sensible, upright, and godly lives [lives with a purpose that reflect spiritual maturity] in this present age, 















###### 13 







awaiting _and_ confidently expecting the [fulfillment of our] blessed hope and the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus, 















###### 14 







who [willingly] gave Himself [to be crucified] on our behalf to redeem us _and_ purchase our freedom from all wickedness, and to purify for Himself a chosen _and_ very special people to be His own possession, _who are_ enthusiastic for doing what is good. 















###### 15 







Tell _them_ these things. Encourage and rebuke with full authority. Let no one disregard _or_ despise you [conduct yourself and your teaching so as to command respect]. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

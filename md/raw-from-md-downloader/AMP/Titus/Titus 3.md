# Titus 3

***
















###### 1 







Remind people to be subject to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready _and_ willing to do good, 















###### 2 







to slander _or_ abuse no one, to be kind _and_ conciliatory and gentle, showing unqualified consideration _and_ courtesy toward everyone. 















###### 3 







For we too once were foolish, disobedient, deceived, enslaved to various _sinful_ desires and pleasures, spending _and_ wasting our life in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another. 















###### 4 







But when the goodness _and_ kindness of God our Savior and _His_ love for mankind appeared [in human form as the Man, Jesus Christ], 















###### 5 







He saved us, not because of any works of righteousness that we have done, but because of His own compassion _and_ mercy, by the cleansing of the new birth (spiritual transformation, regeneration) and renewing by the Holy Spirit, 















###### 6 







whom He poured out richly upon us through Jesus Christ our Savior, 















###### 7 







so that we would be justified [made free of the guilt of sin] by His [compassionate, undeserved] grace, and that we would be [acknowledged as acceptable to Him and] made heirs of eternal life [actually experiencing it] according to our hope (His guarantee). 















###### 8 







This is a faithful _and_ trustworthy saying; and concerning these things I want you to speak with great confidence, so that those who have believed God [that is, those who have trusted in, relied on, and accepted Christ Jesus as Savior,] will be careful to participate in doing good _and_ honorable things. These things are excellent [in themselves] and profitable for the people. 















###### 9 







But avoid foolish _and_ ill-informed _and_ stupid controversies and genealogies and dissensions and quarrels about the Law, for they are unprofitable and useless. 















###### 10 







After a first and second warning reject a divisive man [who promotes heresy and causes dissension--ban him from your fellowship and have nothing more to do with him], 















###### 11 







well aware that such a person is twisted and is sinning; he is convicted _and_ self-condemned [and is gratified by causing confusion among believers]. ## Personal Concerns 















###### 12 







When I send Artemas or [perhaps] Tychicus to you, make every effort to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there. 















###### 13 







Do your best to help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way; see that they are supplied _and_ lack nothing. 















###### 14 







Our people must learn to do good deeds to meet necessary demands [whatever the occasion may require], so that they will not be unproductive. 















###### 15 







All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with all of you. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

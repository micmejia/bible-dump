# Zechariah 10

***
















###### 1 







Ask _for_ rain from the LORD at the time of the spring rain. It is the LORD who makes the thunder clouds; And He will give them showers of rain, grass in the field to everyone. 















###### 2 







For the teraphim (household idols) speak wickedness (emptiness, worthlessness), And the diviners see lying visions And tell false dreams; They comfort in vain. Therefore the people wander like sheep, They are afflicted _and_ suffer because there is no shepherd. 















###### 3 







"My anger is kindled against the shepherds [who are not true shepherds], And I shall punish the male goats (leaders); For the LORD of hosts has visited His flock, the house of Judah (the Southern Kingdom), And will make them like His beautiful _and_ majestic horse in the battle. 















###### 4 







"From them (Judah) shall come the [^a]Cornerstone, From them the tent peg, From them the bow of battle, From them every ruler, all of them together. 















###### 5 







"They will be like mighty men Trampling down _their enemies_ in the mire of the streets in the battle; And they will fight because the LORD is with them, And the [enemies'] riders on horses will be shamed. 















###### 6 







"I will strengthen the house of Judah [making it superior], And I will save the house of Joseph. I will bring them back [and allow them to live securely], Because I have had compassion on them. They will be as though I had not rejected them, For I am the LORD their God, and I will listen _and_ answer them. 















###### 7 







"Then [^b]Ephraim will be like a mighty warrior, And their heart will rejoice as if from wine; Yes, their children will see it and rejoice; Their heart will rejoice _and_ shout triumphantly in the LORD. 















###### 8 







"I will [^c]whistle for them and gather them together, For I have redeemed them; And they will increase [again] as they have increased before [in Egypt]. 















###### 9 







"When I scatter them among the nations, They will remember Me in far countries, And with their children they will live and come back [to Me and the land I gave them]. 















###### 10 







"I will bring them (all Israel) back home again from the land of Egypt And gather them from Assyria, And I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon [the land on the east and on the west of the Jordan] Until no room can be found for them. 















###### 11 







"And they will pass through the sea of distress _and_ anxiety [with the LORD leading His people, as at the Red Sea] And He will strike the waves in the sea, So that all the depths of the Nile will dry up; And the pride of Assyria will be brought down And the scepter [of the taskmasters] of Egypt will pass away. 















###### 12 







"And I will strengthen Israel in the LORD, And they will walk [and glory] in His name," declares the LORD. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: Zechariah 10:7 A reference to the Northern Kingdom. [^c]: Zechariah 10:8 Or _hiss_. From this verse a rabbinical tradition was invented that if a vulture settles on the ground and hisses, the Messiah will come immediately. It was reported to have happened once, but instead of the Messiah coming, the story went that a stone fell on the vulture’s head and killed it because it was a liar.

# Zechariah 11

***
















###### 1 







Open your doors, O Lebanon, That fire may devour your cedars. 















###### 2 







Wail, O cypress, for the cedar has fallen, Because the magnificent trees have been destroyed; Wail, O oaks of Bashan, For the inaccessible forest [on the steep mountainside] has come down. 















###### 3 







There is a sound of the shepherds' wail, For their splendor (grazing land) is ruined; There is a sound of the young lions' roar, For the pride of the Jordan is ruined. 















###### 4 







Thus says the LORD my God, "Pasture the flock _doomed_ for slaughter, 















###### 5 







whose buyers slay them and go unpunished, and those who sell them say, 'Blessed be the LORD, for I have become rich!' And their own shepherds have no pity on them _nor_ protect them [from the wolves]. 















###### 6 







For I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of the land," declares the LORD; "but behold, I will cause the men to fall, each into the hand of another and into the hands of his [foreign] king. And the enemy will strike the land, and I will not rescue the people from their hand." 















###### 7 







So I [Zechariah] pastured the flock _doomed_ for slaughter, truly [as the name implies] the most miserable of sheep. And I took two [shepherd's] staffs, the one I called Favor (Grace) and the other I called Union (Bonds); so I pastured the flock. 















###### 8 







Then I eliminated the three [incompetent, unfit] shepherds [the civil rulers, the priests, and the prophets] in one month, for I was impatient with them, and they also were tired of me _and_ despised me. 















###### 9 







So I said, "I will not pasture you. What is to die, let it die, and what is to be destroyed, let it be destroyed; and let the survivors devour one another's flesh." 















###### 10 







I took my staff, Favor, and broke it in pieces, breaking the covenant which I had made with all the peoples. 















###### 11 







So the covenant was broken on that day, and thus the most wretched of the flock who were watching me realized that it was the word of the LORD. 















###### 12 







I said to them, "If it seems good to you, give me my wages; but if not, do not." So they weighed out [^a]thirty pieces of silver as my wages. 















###### 13 







[^b]Then the LORD said to me, "Throw it to the potter [as if to the dogs]--that _magnificent_ sum at which I am valued by them!" So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them to the potter in the house of the LORD. 















###### 14 







Then I broke my second staff, Union, into pieces to break the brotherhood between Judah (the Southern Kingdom) and Israel (the Northern Kingdom). 















###### 15 







The LORD said to me, "Take again for yourself the equipment [of a shepherd, but this time] of a foolish shepherd. 















###### 16 







For behold, I am going to raise up a [false] shepherd in the land who will not care for the perishing, seek the scattered, heal the broken, or feed the healthy; but will eat the flesh of the fat ones and tear off their hoofs [to consume everything]. 















###### 17 







"Woe (judgment is coming) to the worthless _and_ foolish shepherd Who deserts the flock! The sword will strike his arm And his right eye! His arm shall be totally withered And his right eye completely blinded." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

The shekel was the standard wage for a day of labor, and the payment was _weighed_ because the shekel was actually a unit of weight. [^b]: Zechariah 11:13 At this point the pre-incarnate Christ intervenes and prophetically refers to the payment given by the religious leaders to Judas for his betrayal (Matt 26:15).

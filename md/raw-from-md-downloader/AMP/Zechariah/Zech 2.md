# Zechariah 2

***
















###### 1 







And I looked up, and saw a man with a measuring line in his hand. 















###### 2 







So I said, "Where are you going?" And he said to me, "To measure Jerusalem, to see how wide it is and how long it is." 















###### 3 







And behold, the angel who was speaking with me was going out, and another angel was coming out to meet him, 















###### 4 







and he said to the second angel, "Run, speak to that young man, saying, 'Jerusalem will be inhabited [like villages] without walls [spreading out into the open country] because of the great number of people and livestock in it. 















###### 5 







For I,' declares the LORD, 'will be a wall of fire around her [protecting her from enemies], and I will be the glory in her midst.'" 















###### 6 







"[^a]Hear this! Flee from [Babylon] the land of the north [which shall come under judgment]," declares the LORD, "for I have scattered you like the four winds of the heavens," declares the LORD. 















###### 7 







"Hear, Zion (Jerusalem)! Escape, [^b]you who are living with the daughter of Babylon!" 















###### 8 







For thus says the LORD of hosts, "After [^c]glory He has sent Me against the nations which plunder you--for he who touches you, touches the apple of His eye. 















###### 9 







Behold, I will wave my hand over them and they shall become plunder for their own slaves. Then you shall know (recognize, understand fully) that the LORD of hosts has sent Me. 















###### 10 







Sing for joy and rejoice, O Daughter of Zion; for behold, I am coming, and I will dwell in your midst," declares the LORD. 















###### 11 







Many nations shall join themselves to the LORD in that day and shall be My people. And I will dwell in your midst, and you shall know (recognize, understand fully) that the LORD of hosts has sent Me to you. 















###### 12 







The LORD will take possession of Judah as His portion in the holy land and will again choose Jerusalem. 















###### 13 







"Be still before the LORD, all mankind; for He is roused (raised up) from His holy habitation [in response to His persecuted people]." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

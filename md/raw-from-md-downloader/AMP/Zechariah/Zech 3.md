# Zechariah 3

***
















###### 1 







Then the guiding angel showed me Joshua the high priest [representing disobedient, sinful Israel] standing before the [^a]Angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at Joshua's right hand to be his adversary _and_ to accuse him. 















###### 2 







And the LORD said to Satan, "The LORD rebuke you, Satan! Even the LORD, who [now and ever] has chosen Jerusalem, rebuke you! Is this not a [^b]log snatched _and_ rescued from the fire?" 















###### 3 







Now Joshua was clothed with [^c]filthy (nauseatingly vile) garments and was standing before the Angel [of the LORD]. 















###### 4 







He spoke to those who stood before Him, saying, "Remove the filthy garments from him." And He said to Joshua, "See, I have caused your wickedness to be taken away from you, and I will clothe _and_ beautify you with rich robes [of forgiveness]." 















###### 5 







And I (Zechariah) said, "Let them put a clean turban on his head." So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with [rich] garments. And the Angel of the LORD stood by. 















###### 6 







And the Angel of the LORD [solemnly and earnestly] admonished Joshua, saying, 















###### 7 







"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'If you will walk in My ways [that is, remain faithful] and perform My service, then you will also govern My house and have charge of My courts, and I will give you free access [to My presence] among these who are standing here. ## The Branch 















###### 8 







Now listen, Joshua, the high priest, you and your colleagues who are sitting in front of you--indeed they are men who are a symbol [of what is to come]--for behold, I am going to bring in My servant the [^d]Branch [in Messianic glory]. 















###### 9 







For behold, the [^e]stone which I have set before Joshua; on that one stone are seven eyes (symbolizing infinite intelligence, omniscience). Behold, I will engrave an inscription on it,' declares the LORD of hosts, 'and I will remove the wickedness _and_ guilt of this land in a single day. 















###### 10 







In that day,' declares the LORD of hosts, 'every one of you will invite his neighbor to sit under his vine and his fig tree [enjoying peace and prosperity in the kingdom].'" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Zechariah 6

***
















###### 1 







Now again I looked up, and [^a]four chariots were coming out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of [firm, immovable] bronze (divine judgment). 















###### 2 







The first chariot had red horses (war, bloodshed), the second chariot had black horses (famine, death), 















###### 3 







the third chariot had white horses (victory), and the fourth chariot had strong dappled horses (death through judgment). 















###### 4 







Then I said to the angel who was speaking with me, "What are these, my lord?" 















###### 5 







The angel answered me, "These are the four spirits of the heavens, which go out after presenting themselves before the Lord of all the earth, 















###### 6 







with the chariot with the black horses going toward the north country; then the one with the white horses follows after them [because there are two northern powers to overcome], and the chariot with the dappled horses goes toward the south country." 















###### 7 







When the strong horses went out, they were eager to patrol the earth. And the LORD said, "Go, patrol the earth." So they patrolled the earth [watching and protecting it]. 















###### 8 







Then He called out to me and said to me, "See, those who are going to the north country have quieted My Spirit [of wrath] in the north country." 















###### 9 







The word of the LORD also came to me, saying, 















###### 10 







"Take _an offering_ from the exiles, from Heldai, from Tobijah, and from Jedaiah [as representatives]; and you go the same day and enter the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have arrived from Babylon. ## The Symbolic Crowns 















###### 11 







Take silver and gold [from them], and make an _ornate_ crown and set it on the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest. 















###### 12 







Then say to Joshua, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, "Behold (look, keep in sight, watch), a Man (Messiah) whose name is Branch, for He shall branch out from His place (Israel, the Davidic line); and He shall build the [ultimate] temple of the LORD. 















###### 13 







Yes, [you are to build a temple of the LORD, but] it is He who shall build the [ultimate] temple of the LORD, and He shall bear the honor _and_ majesty [as the only begotten of the Father] and sit and rule on His throne. And He shall be a [^b]Priest on His throne, and the counsel of peace shall be between the two offices [Priest and King]."' 















###### 14 







Now the crown shall become a reminder in the temple of the LORD to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah, and Hen the son of Zephaniah. 















###### 15 







And those who are far away will come and [help] build the temple of the LORD." Then you shall know [without any doubt] that the LORD of hosts sent me (Zechariah) to you. And it will come about if you will diligently obey the [voice of the] LORD your God. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

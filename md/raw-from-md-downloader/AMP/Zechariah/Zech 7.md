# Zechariah 7

***
















###### 1 







In the fourth year of [the reign of] King Darius [of Persia], the word of the LORD came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, _which is_ Chislev (Dec 7, 518 b.c.). 















###### 2 







Now the people of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regem-melech and their men to seek the favor of the LORD, 















###### 3 







speaking to the priests who belong to the house of the LORD of hosts and to the prophets, saying, "[Now that I am returned from exile] shall I weep in the fifth month [mourning the destruction of the temple], and fast as I have done these many years [in Babylon]?" 















###### 4 







Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me (Zechariah), saying, 















###### 5 







"Speak to all the people of the land and to the priests, saying, 'When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months these seventy years [that you were in exile], was it actually for Me that you fasted?

###### 10 







and do not oppress _or_ exploit the widow or the fatherless, the stranger or the poor; and do not devise _or_ even imagine evil in your hearts against one another.' 















###### 11 







But they refused to listen _and_ pay attention and turned a stubborn shoulder [stiffening themselves in resistance] and stopped up their ears. 















###### 12 







They made their hearts [hard] like flint, so that they could not hear the law and the words which the LORD of hosts had sent by His Spirit through the former prophets. Therefore great wrath came from the LORD of hosts. 















###### 13 







And just as He called and they would not listen, so they called and I would not listen," says the LORD of hosts; 















###### 14 







"but I scattered them with a storm wind among all the nations whom they have not known. Thus the land was desolate after they had gone, so that no one passed through or returned, for they [by their sins] had made the pleasant land desolate _and_ deserted." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Zechariah 8

***
















###### 1 







Then the word of the LORD of hosts came [to me], saying, 















###### 2 







"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'I am [^a]jealous for Zion with great jealousy [demanding what is rightfully and uniquely mine], and I am jealous for her with great wrath [against her enemies].' 















###### 3 







Thus says the LORD, 'I shall return to Zion and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem, and Jerusalem shall be called the [faithful] City of Truth, and the mountain of the LORD of hosts will be called the Holy Mountain.' 















###### 4 







Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'Old men and old women will again sit in the [^b]streets (public places) of Jerusalem, each man with his staff in his hand because of his advanced age. 















###### 5 







And the streets of the city will be filled with boys and girls playing in its streets.' 















###### 6 







Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'If it is difficult in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days [in which this comes to pass], will it also be difficult in My sight?' declares the LORD of hosts. 















###### 7 







Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'Behold, I am going to save My people from the east country and from the west, 















###### 8 







and I will bring them home and they will live in the midst of Jerusalem; and they shall be My people, and I will be their God in truth (faithfulness) and in righteousness.' 















###### 9 







"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'Let your hands be strong, you who in these days hear these words from the mouths of the prophets who, on the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, foretold that the temple might be rebuilt. 















###### 10 







For before those days there were no wages for man or animal; nor was there any peace _or_ success for him who went out or came in because of his enemies, for I set all men against one another. 















###### 11 







But now [in this time since you began to build] I will not treat the remnant of this people as in the former days,' declares the LORD of hosts. 















###### 12 







'For there the seed will produce peace _and_ prosperity; the vine will yield its fruit, and the ground will produce its increase, and the heavens will give their dew. And I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit _and_ possess all these things. 















###### 13 







And as you have been a curse among the nations, O house of Judah (Southern Kingdom) and house of Israel (Northern Kingdom), so I will save you, that you may be a blessing. Fear not; let your hands be strong.' 















###### 14 







"For thus says the LORD of hosts, 'Just as I planned to do harm to you when your fathers provoked Me to wrath,' says the LORD of hosts, 'and I did not relent, 















###### 15 







so I have again planned in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Do not fear! 















###### 16 







These are the things which you should do: speak the truth with one another; judge with truth and pronounce the judgment that brings peace in [the courts at] your gates. 















###### 17 







And let none of you devise _or_ even imagine evil in your heart against another, and do not love lying _or_ half-truths; for all these things I hate,' declares the LORD." 















###### 18 







Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me (Zechariah), saying, 















###### 19 







"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'The fast of the fourth [month to mourn the breaching of Jerusalem's walls], the fast of the fifth [month to mourn the temple's destruction], the fast of the seventh [month to mourn Gedaliah's assassination], and the fast of the tenth [month to mourn the siege of Jerusalem] will become times of joy and gladness and cheerful feasts for the house of Judah; so [to bring this about] love truth and peace.' 















###### 20 







"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'It will come to pass that peoples and the inhabitants of many cities will come [to Jerusalem]. 















###### 21 







The inhabitants of one [city] will go to another, saying, "Let us go at once to ask the favor of the LORD and to seek the LORD of hosts. I will go also." 















###### 22 







So many peoples and powerful nations will come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem and to ask the LORD for His favor.' 















###### 23 







Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'In those days ten men [as representatives] from all the nations will grasp the robe of a Jew, saying, "Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you."'" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: Zechariah 8:4 The Hebrew word refers to broad, spread-out spaces such as wide streets, squares, plazas, public parks, and so throughout.

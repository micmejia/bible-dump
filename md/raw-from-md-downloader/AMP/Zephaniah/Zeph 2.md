# Zephaniah 2

***
















###### 1 







Gather yourselves together [in repentance], yes, gather [in submission], O nation without shame, 















###### 2 







Before the decree takes effect [and the time for repentance is lost]-- The day passes like the chaff [whirled by the wind]-- Before the burning _and_ fierce anger of the LORD comes upon you, Before the day of the wrath of the LORD comes upon you. 















###### 3 







Seek the LORD [search diligently for Him and regard Him as the foremost necessity of your life], All you humble of the land Who have practiced His ordinances _and_ have kept His commandments; Seek righteousness, seek humility [regard them as vital]. Perhaps you will be hidden [and pardoned and rescued] In the day of the Lord's anger. 















###### 4 







For [this is the fate of the Philistines:] Gaza will be abandoned And Ashkelon a desolation; [The people of] Ashdod will be driven out at noon [in broad daylight] And Ekron will be uprooted _and_ destroyed. 















###### 5 







Woe (judgment is coming) to the inhabitants of the seacoast, The nation of the Cherethites [in Philistia]! The word of the LORD is against you, O Canaan, land of the Philistines; I will destroy you So that no inhabitant will be left. 















###### 6 







So the [depopulated] seacoast shall be pastures, With [deserted] meadows for shepherds and folds for flocks. 















###### 7 







The [^a]seacoast will belong To the remnant of the house of Judah; They will pasture [their flocks] on it. In the [deserted] houses of Ashkelon [in Philistia] they [of Judah] will lie down _and_ rest in the evening, For the LORD their God will care for them; And restore their fortune [permitting them to occupy the land]. 















###### 8 







"I have heard the taunting of Moab And the revilings of the sons of Ammon, With which they have taunted My people And become arrogant against their territory [by violating Israel's boundary and trying to seize its land]. 















###### 9 







"Therefore, as I live," declares the LORD of hosts, The God of Israel, "[^b]Moab will in fact become like Sodom And the [^c]sons of Ammon like Gomorrah, A land possessed by nettles and salt pits, And a perpetual desolation. The remnant of My people will plunder them And what is left of My nation will inherit them [as their own]." 















###### 10 







This they shall have in return for their pride, because they have taunted and become arrogant against the people of the LORD of hosts. 















###### 11 







The LORD will be terrifying _and_ awesome to them, for He will starve all the gods of the earth; and all the coastlands of the nations will bow down _and_ worship Him, everyone from his own place. 















###### 12 







"You also, O Ethiopians, will be slain by My sword." 















###### 13 







And the LORD will stretch out His hand against the north And destroy Assyria, And He will make Nineveh a desolation [a wasteland], Parched as the desert. 















###### 14 







Flocks will lie down in her midst, All the animals which range in herds; Both the pelican and the short-eared owl Will roost on the top of Nineveh's pillars. Birds will sing in the window, Desolation will be on the threshold; For He has uncovered the cedar paneling. 















###### 15 







This is the joyous city Which dwells carelessly [feeling so secure], Who says in her heart, "I am, and there is no one besides me." What a desolation she has become, A lair for [wild] animals! Everyone who passes by her will hiss [in scorn] And wave his hand _in contempt_. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

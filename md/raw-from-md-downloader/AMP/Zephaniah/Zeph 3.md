# Zephaniah 3

***
















###### 1 







Woe (judgment is coming) to her who is rebellious and defiled, The tyrannical city [Jerusalem]! 















###### 2 







She did not listen _and_ heed the voice [of God]; She accepted no correction. She did not trust in the LORD [but trusted her own power]; She did not draw near to her God [but to the pagan gods of Baal or Molech]. 















###### 3 







Her officials within her are roaring lions; Her judges are [as hungry as] the wolves at evening, They leave nothing for the morning. 















###### 4 







Her prophets are reckless and treacherous men; Her priests have profaned the sanctuary; They have done violence to the law [by pretending their word is God's word]. 















###### 5 







The LORD is righteous within her; He will do no injustice. Every morning He brings His justice to light; He does not fail. But the unjust person knows no shame. 















###### 6 







"I [the LORD] have cut off _and_ destroyed nations [as a warning to Judah]; Their corner towers (battlements) are in ruins. I have made their streets desolate So that no one passes by; Their cities are destroyed So that there is no man, there is no inhabitant. 















###### 7 







"I said, 'Most certainly you will [reverently] fear Me; Accept correction.' So Jerusalem's dwelling will not be cut off _In accordance with_ all that I have appointed concerning her [punishment], But they were eager [even rising early] to make all their deeds corrupt. 















###### 8 







"Therefore [you of the godly remnant of Judah, patiently] wait for Me," declares the LORD, "[Wait] for the day when I rise up as a witness [against the nations]. For it is My decision _and_ My right to gather the nations, To assemble kingdoms, To pour out on them My indignation, All [the heat of] My burning anger; For [in that day] all the earth shall be consumed By the fire of My zeal. 















###### 9 







"Then I will give to the peoples [clear and pure speech from] purified lips [which reflect their purified hearts], That all of them may call on the name of the LORD, To serve Him shoulder to shoulder (united). 















###### 10 







"From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia My worshipers, [the descendants of] My dispersed ones, Will bring My offerings. 















###### 11 







"On that day you [Israel] will feel no shame Because of all your acts By which you have rebelled _and_ sinned against Me; Then I will remove from among you Your rejoicing ones who delight in their pride; And you will never again behave arrogantly On My holy mountain [Mount Zion]. ## A Remnant of Israel 















###### 12 







"But I will leave among you A humble and lowly people, And they will take refuge _and_ trust confidently in the name of the LORD. 















###### 13 







"The remnant of Israel will do no wrong Nor speak lies, Nor will a deceitful tongue Be found in their mouths; For they will eat and lie down With no one to make them tremble _and_ feel afraid." 















###### 14 







Shout for joy, O Daughter of Zion! Shout _in triumph_, O Israel! Rejoice, be in high spirits _and_ glory with all your heart, O Daughter of Jerusalem [in that day]! 















###### 15 







The LORD has taken away the judgments against you; He has cleared away your enemies. The King of Israel, even the LORD [Himself], is in your midst; You will no longer fear disaster. 















###### 16 







In that day it will be said to Jerusalem: "Do not be afraid, O Zion; Do not let your hands fall limp. 















###### 17 







"The LORD your God is in your midst, A Warrior who saves. He will rejoice over you with joy; He will be quiet in His love [making no mention of your past sins], He will rejoice over you with shouts of joy. 















###### 18 







"I will gather those [Israelites in captivity] who grieve about the appointed feasts-- They came from you, [O Zion]; On whom the reproach [of exile] is a burden. 















###### 19 







"Behold, at that time I am going to deal With all your oppressors; I will save the lame And gather the scattered, And I will turn their shame into praise and renown In every land [where they have suffered]. 















###### 20 







"At that time I will bring you in, Yes, at the time I gather you together; For I will make you a name and a praise Among all the peoples of the earth When I restore your fortunes [and freedom] before your eyes," Says the LORD. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

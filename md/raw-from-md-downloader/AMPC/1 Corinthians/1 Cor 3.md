# 1 Corinthians 3

***














###### 1 






However, brethren, I could not talk to you as to spiritual [men], but as to nonspiritual [men of the flesh, in whom the carnal nature predominates], as to mere infants [in the new life] in Christ [[^a]unable to talk yet!] 













###### 2 






I fed you with milk, not solid food, for you were not yet strong enough [to be ready for it]; but even yet you are not strong enough [to be ready for it], 













###### 3 






For you are still [unspiritual, having the nature] of the flesh [under the control of ordinary impulses]. For as long as [there are] envying and jealousy _and_ wrangling and factions among you, are you not unspiritual _and_ of the flesh, behaving yourselves after a human standard _and_ like mere (unchanged) men? 













###### 4 






For when one says, I belong to Paul, and another, I belong to Apollos, are you not [proving yourselves] ordinary (unchanged) men? 













###### 5 






What then is Apollos? What is Paul? Ministering servants [not heads of parties] through whom you believed, even as the Lord appointed to each his task: 













###### 6 






I planted, Apollos watered, but God [all the while] was making it grow _and_ [He] gave the increase. 













###### 7 






So neither he who plants is anything nor he who waters, but [only] God Who makes it grow _and_ become greater. 













###### 8 






He who plants and he who waters are equal (one in aim, of the same importance and esteem), yet each shall receive his own reward (wages), according to his own labor. 













###### 9 






For we are fellow workmen (joint promoters, laborers together) with _and_ for God; _you_ are God's [^b]garden _and_ vineyard _and_ field under cultivation, [you are] God's building. 













###### 10 






According to the grace (the special endowment for my task) of God bestowed on me, like a skillful architect _and_ master builder I laid [the] foundation, and now another [man] is building upon it. But let each [man] be careful how he builds upon it, 













###### 11 






For no other foundation can anyone lay than that which is [already] laid, which is Jesus Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One). 













###### 12 






But if anyone builds upon the Foundation, whether it be with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, 













###### 13 






The work of each [one] will become [plainly, openly] known (shown for what it is); for the day [of Christ] will disclose _and_ declare it, because it will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test _and_ critically appraise the character _and_ worth of the work each person has done. 













###### 14 






If the work which any person has built on this Foundation [any product of his efforts whatever] survives [this test], he will get his reward. 













###### 15 






But if any person's work is burned up [under the test], he will suffer the loss [of it all, losing his reward], though he himself will be saved, but only as [one who has passed] through fire. 













###### 16 






Do you not discern _and_ understand that you [the whole church at Corinth] are God's temple (His sanctuary), and that God's Spirit has His permanent dwelling in you [to be at home in you, [^c]collectively as a church and also individually]? 













###### 17 






If anyone [^d]does hurt to God's temple _or_ corrupts it [[^e]with false doctrines] _or_ destroys it, God will [^f]do hurt to him _and_ bring him to the corruption of death _and_ destroy him. For the temple of God is holy (sacred to Him) and that [temple] you [[^g]the believing church and its individual believers] are. 













###### 18 






Let no person deceive himself. If anyone among you supposes that he is wise in this age, let him become a fool [let him discard his worldly discernment and recognize himself as dull, stupid, and foolish, without true learning and scholarship], that he may become [really] wise. 













###### 19 






For this world's wisdom is foolishness (absurdity and stupidity) with God, for it is written, He lays hold of the wise in their [own] craftiness; 













###### 20 






And again, The Lord knows the thoughts _and_ reasonings of the [humanly] wise _and_ recognizes how futile they are. 













###### 21 






So let no one exult proudly concerning men [boasting of having this or that man as a leader], for all things are yours, 













###### 22 






Whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas (Peter), or the universe or life or death, or the immediate _and_ [^h]threatening present or the [subsequent and uncertain] future--all are yours, 













###### 23

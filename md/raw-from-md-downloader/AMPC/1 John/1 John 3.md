# 1 John 3

***














###### 1 






See what [[^a]an incredible] quality of love the Father has given (shown, bestowed on) us, that we should [be permitted to] be named _and_ called _and_ counted the children of God! And so we are! The reason that the world does not know (recognize, acknowledge) us is that it does not know (recognize, acknowledge) Him. 













###### 2 






Beloved, we are [even here and] now God's children; it is not yet disclosed (made clear) what we shall be [hereafter], but we know that when He comes _and_ is manifested, we shall [[^b]as God's children] resemble _and_ be like Him, for we shall see Him [^c]just as He [really] is. 













###### 3 






And everyone who has this hope [resting] on Him cleanses (purifies) himself just as He is pure (chaste, undefiled, guiltless). 













###### 4 






Everyone who commits (practices) sin is guilty of lawlessness; for [that is what] sin is, lawlessness (the breaking, violating of God's law by transgression or neglect--being unrestrained and unregulated by His commands and His will). 













###### 5 






You know that He appeared in visible form _and_ became Man to take away [upon Himself] sins, and in Him there is no sin [[^d]essentially and forever]. 













###### 6 






No one who abides in Him [who lives and remains [^e]in communion with and in obedience to Him--deliberately, knowingly, and [^f]habitually] commits (practices) sin. No one who [habitually] sins has either seen _or_ known Him [recognized, perceived, or understood Him, or has had an experiential acquaintance with Him]. 













###### 7 






[^g]Boys (lads), let no one deceive _and_ lead you astray. He who practices righteousness [who is upright, conforming to the divine will in purpose, thought, and action, living a consistently conscientious life] is righteous, even as He is righteous. 













###### 8 






[But] he who commits sin [who practices evildoing] is of the devil [takes his character from the evil one], for the devil has sinned (violated the divine law) from the beginning. The reason the Son of God was made manifest (visible) was to undo (destroy, loosen, and dissolve) the works the devil [has done]. 













###### 9 






No one born (begotten) of God [deliberately, knowingly, and [^h]habitually] practices sin, for God's nature abides in him [His principle of life, the divine sperm, remains permanently within him]; and he cannot practice sinning because he is born (begotten) of God. 













###### 10 






By this it is made clear who take their nature from God _and_ are His children and who take their nature from the devil _and_ are his children: no one who does not practice righteousness [who does not conform to God's will in purpose, thought, and action] is of God; neither is anyone who does not love his brother (his fellow [^i]believer in Christ). 













###### 11 






For this is the message (the announcement) which you have heard from the first, that we should love one another, 













###### 12 






[And] not be like Cain who [took his nature and got his motivation] from the evil one and slew his brother. And why did he slay him? Because his deeds (activities, works) were wicked _and_ malicious and his brother's were righteous (virtuous). 













###### 13 






Do not be surprised _and_ wonder, brethren, that the world detests _and_ pursues you with hatred. 













###### 14 






We know that we have passed over out of death into Life by the fact that we love the brethren (our fellow Christians). He who does not love abides (remains, is [^j]held and kept continually) in [spiritual] death. 













###### 15 






Anyone who hates (abominates, detests) his brother [in Christ] is [at heart] a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding ([^k]persevering) within him. 













###### 16 






By this we come to know (progressively to recognize, to perceive, to understand) the [essential] love: that He laid down His [own] life for us; and we ought to lay [our] lives down for [those who are our] brothers [[^l]in Him]. 













###### 17 






But if anyone has this world's goods (resources for sustaining life) and sees his brother _and_ [^m]fellow believer in need, yet closes his heart of compassion against him, how can the love of God live _and_ remain in him? 













###### 18 






Little children, let us not love [merely] in theory _or_ in speech but in deed and in truth (in practice and in sincerity). 













###### 19 






By this we shall come to know (perceive, recognize, and understand) that we are of the Truth, and can reassure (quiet, conciliate, and pacify) our hearts in His presence, 













###### 20 






Whenever our hearts in [[^n]tormenting] self-accusation make us feel guilty _and_ condemn us. [For [^o]we are in God's hands.] For He is above _and_ greater than our consciences (our hearts), and He knows (perceives and understands) everything [nothing is hidden from Him]. 













###### 21 






And, beloved, if our consciences (our hearts) do not accuse us [if they do not make us feel guilty and condemn us], we have confidence (complete assurance and boldness) before God, 













###### 22 






And we receive from Him whatever we ask, because we [[^p]watchfully] obey His orders [observe His suggestions and injunctions, follow His plan for us] _and_ [[^q]habitually] practice what is pleasing to Him. 













###### 23 






And this is His order (His command, His injunction): that we should believe in (put our faith and trust in and adhere to and rely on) the name of His Son Jesus Christ (the Messiah), and that we should love one another, just as He has commanded us. 













###### 24 






All who keep His commandments [who obey His orders and follow His plan, live and continue to live, to stay and] abide in Him, and He in them. [[^r]They let Christ be a home to them and they are the home of Christ.] And by this we know _and_ understand _and_ have the proof that He [really] lives _and_ makes His home in us: by the [Holy] Spirit Whom He has given us. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

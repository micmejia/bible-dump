But archaeological discoveries prove that “precisely during the period 1100-900 b.c., when the kingdom of Israel was being built up, ‘the weak and inglorious twenty-first dynasty’ was ruling in Egypt and at the same time Assyria went into a period of decline” (J. P. Free, _Archaeology and Bible History_, citing A. T. Olmstead, _History of Assyria_). [^b]: 1 Kings 4:31 “Wiser than all other men,” until Christ came. Jesus said, “Someone more _and_ greater than Solomon is here” (Matt. 12:42).

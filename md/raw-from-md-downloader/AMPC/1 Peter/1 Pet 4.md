# 1 Peter 4

***














###### 1 






So, since Christ suffered in the flesh [^a]_for us, for you_, arm yourselves with the same thought _and_ [^b]purpose [patiently to suffer rather than fail to please God]. For whoever has suffered in the flesh [having [^c]the mind of Christ] is done with [intentional] sin [has stopped pleasing himself and the world, and pleases God], 













###### 2 






So that he can no longer spend the rest of his natural life living by [his] human appetites _and_ desires, but [he lives] for what God wills. 













###### 3 






For the time that is past already suffices for doing what the Gentiles like to do--living [as you have done] in shameless, insolent wantonness, in lustful desires, drunkenness, reveling, drinking bouts _and_ abominable, lawless idolatries. 













###### 4 






They are astonished _and_ think it very queer that you do not now run hand in hand with them in the same excesses of dissipation, and they abuse [you]. 













###### 5 






But they will have to give an account to Him Who is ready to judge _and_ pass sentence on the living and the dead. 













###### 6 






For this is why the good news (the Gospel) was preached [[^d]in their lifetime] even to the dead, that though judged in fleshly bodies as men are, they might live in the spirit as God does. 













###### 7 






But the end _and_ culmination of all things has now come near; keep sound minded _and_ self-restrained and alert therefore for [the practice of] prayer. 













###### 8 






Above all things have intense _and_ unfailing love for one another, for love covers a multitude of sins [forgives and [^e]disregards the offenses of others]. 













###### 9 






Practice hospitality to one another (those of the household of faith). [Be hospitable, be a lover of strangers, with brotherly affection for the unknown guests, the foreigners, the poor, and all others who come your way who are of Christ's body.] And [in each instance] do it ungrudgingly (cordially and graciously, without complaining but as representing Him). 













###### 10 






As each of you has received a gift (a particular spiritual talent, a gracious divine endowment), employ it for one another as [befits] good trustees of God's many-sided grace [faithful stewards of the [^f]extremely diverse powers and gifts granted to Christians by unmerited favor]. 













###### 11 






Whoever speaks, [let him do it as one who utters] oracles of God; whoever renders service, [let him do it] as with the strength which God furnishes [^g]abundantly, so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ (the Messiah). To Him be the glory and dominion forever and ever (through endless ages). Amen (so be it). 













###### 12 






Beloved, do not be amazed _and_ bewildered at the fiery ordeal which is taking place to test your quality, as though something strange (unusual and alien to you and your position) were befalling you. 













###### 13 






But insofar as you are sharing Christ's sufferings, rejoice, so that when His glory [full of radiance and splendor] is revealed, you may also rejoice with triumph [exultantly]. 













###### 14 






If you are censured _and_ suffer abuse [because you bear] the name of Christ, blessed [are you--happy, fortunate, [^h]to be envied, [^i]with life-joy, and satisfaction in God's favor and salvation, regardless of your outward condition], because the Spirit of glory, the Spirit of God, is resting upon you. _On their part He is blasphemed, but on your part He is glorified_. 













###### 15 






But let none of you suffer as a murderer or a thief or any sort of criminal, or as a mischief-maker (a meddler) in the affairs of others [infringing on their rights]. 













###### 16 






But if [one is ill-treated and suffers] as a Christian [which he is contemptuously called], let him not be ashamed, but give glory to God that he is [deemed worthy to suffer] in this name. 













###### 17 






For the time [has arrived] for judgment to begin with the household of God; and if it begins with us, what will [be] the end of those who do not respect _or_ believe _or_ obey the good news (the Gospel) of God? 













###### 18 






And if the righteous are barely saved, what will become of the godless and wicked? 













###### 19 






Therefore, those who are ill-treated _and_ suffer in accordance with God's will must do right and commit their souls [in charge as a deposit] to the One Who created [them] and will never fail [them]. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# 1 Thessalonians 4

***














###### 1 






Furthermore, [^a]brethren, we beg and admonish you in [virtue of our union with] the Lord Jesus, that [you follow the instructions which] you learned from us about how you ought to walk so as to please _and_ gratify God, as indeed you are doing, [and] that you do so even more and more abundantly [attaining yet greater perfection in living this life]. 













###### 2 






For you know what charges _and_ precepts we gave you [[^b]on the authority and by the inspiration of] the Lord Jesus. 













###### 3 






For this is the will of God, that you should be consecrated (separated and set apart for pure and holy living): that you should abstain _and_ shrink from all sexual vice, 













###### 4 






That each one of you should know how to [^c]possess (control, manage) his own [^d]body in consecration (purity, separated from things profane) and honor, 













###### 5 






Not [to be used] in the passion of lust like the heathen, who are ignorant of the true God _and_ have no knowledge of His will, 













###### 6 






That no man transgress and overreach his brother _and_ defraud him in this matter _or_ defraud his brother in business. For the Lord is an avenger in all these things, as we have already warned you solemnly _and_ [^e]told you plainly. 













###### 7 






For God has not called us to impurity but to consecration [to dedicate ourselves to the most thorough purity]. 













###### 8 






Therefore whoever disregards (sets aside and rejects this) disregards not man but God, Whose [very] Spirit [Whom] He gives to you is holy (chaste, pure). 













###### 9 






But concerning brotherly love [for all other Christians], you have no need to have anyone write you, for you yourselves have been [personally] taught by God to love one another. 













###### 10 






And indeed you already are [extending and displaying your love] to all the brethren throughout Macedonia. But we beseech _and_ earnestly exhort you, brethren, that you [^f]excel [in this matter] more and more, 













###### 11 






To make it your ambition _and_ definitely endeavor to live quietly _and_ peacefully, to mind your own affairs, and to work with your hands, as we charged you, 













###### 12 






So that you may bear yourselves becomingly _and_ be correct _and_ honorable _and_ command the respect of the outside world, being dependent on nobody [self-supporting] _and_ having need of nothing. 













###### 13 






Now also we would not have you ignorant, brethren, about those who fall asleep [[^g]in death], that you may not grieve [for them] as the rest do who have no hope [beyond the grave]. 













###### 14 






For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will also bring with Him through Jesus those who have fallen asleep [[^h]in death]. 













###### 15 






For this we declare to you by the Lord's [own] word, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord shall in no way precede [into His presence] _or_ have any advantage at all over those who have previously fallen asleep [in Him [^i]in death]. 













###### 16 






For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a loud cry of summons, with the shout of an archangel, and with the blast of the trumpet of God. And those who have departed this life in Christ will rise first. 













###### 17 






Then we, the living ones who remain [on the earth], shall simultaneously be caught up along with [the resurrected dead] in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and so always (through the eternity of the eternities) we shall be with the Lord! 













###### 18 






Therefore comfort _and_ encourage one another with these words. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

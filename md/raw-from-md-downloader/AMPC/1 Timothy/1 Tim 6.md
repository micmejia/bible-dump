# 1 Timothy 6

***














###### 1 






Let all who are under the yoke as bond servants esteem their own [personal] masters worthy of honor _and_ fullest respect, so that the name of God and the teaching [about Him] may not be brought into disrepute _and_ blasphemed. 













###### 2 






Let those who have believing masters not be disrespectful _or_ scornful [to them] on the grounds that they are brothers [in Christ]; rather, they should serve [them all the better] because those who benefit by their kindly service are believers and beloved. Teach and urge these duties. 













###### 3 






But if anyone teaches otherwise and does not [^a]assent to the sound _and_ wholesome messages of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) and the teaching which is in agreement with godliness (piety toward God), 













###### 4 






He is puffed up with pride _and_ stupefied with conceit, [although he is] woefully ignorant. He has a [^b]morbid fondness for controversy and disputes _and_ strife about words, which result in (produce) envy _and_ jealousy, quarrels _and_ dissension, abuse _and_ insults _and_ slander, and base suspicions, 













###### 5 






And protracted wrangling _and_ wearing discussion _and_ perpetual friction among men who are corrupted in mind and bereft of the truth, who imagine that godliness _or_ righteousness is a [^c]source of profit [a moneymaking business, a means of livelihood]. _From such withdraw_. 













###### 6 






[And it is, indeed, a source of immense profit, for] godliness accompanied with contentment (that contentment which is a sense of [^d]inward sufficiency) is great _and_ abundant gain. 













###### 7 






For we brought nothing into the world, and _obviously_ we cannot take anything out of the world; 













###### 8 






But if we have food and clothing, with these we shall be content (satisfied). 













###### 9 






But those who crave to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish (useless, godless) and hurtful desires that plunge men into ruin _and_ destruction and miserable perishing. 













###### 10 






For the love of money is a root of all evils; it is through this craving that some have been led astray _and_ have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves through with many [^e]acute [mental] pangs. 













###### 11 






But as for you, O man of God, flee from all these things; aim at _and_ pursue righteousness (right standing with God and true goodness), godliness (which is the loving fear of God and being Christlike), faith, love, steadfastness (patience), and gentleness of heart. 













###### 12 






Fight the good fight of the faith; lay hold of the eternal life to which you were summoned and [for which] you confessed the good confession [of faith] before many witnesses. 













###### 13 






In the presence of God, Who preserves alive all living things, and of Christ Jesus, Who in His testimony before Pontius Pilate made the good confession, I [solemnly] charge you 













###### 14 






To keep all His precepts unsullied _and_ flawless, irreproachable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Anointed One), 













###### 15 






Which [appearing] will be shown forth in His own proper time by the blessed, only Sovereign (Ruler), the King of kings and the Lord of lords, 













###### 16 






Who alone has immortality [in the sense of exemption from every kind of death] and lives in unapproachable light, Whom no man has ever seen or can see. Unto Him be honor and everlasting power _and_ dominion. Amen (so be it). 













###### 17 






As for the rich in this world, charge them not to be proud _and_ arrogant _and_ contemptuous of others, nor to set their hopes on uncertain riches, but on God, Who richly _and_ ceaselessly provides us with everything for [our] enjoyment. 













###### 18 






[Charge them] to do good, to be rich in good works, to be liberal _and_ generous of heart, ready to share [with others], 













###### 19 






In this way laying up for themselves [the riches that endure forever as] a good foundation for the future, so that they may grasp that which is life indeed. 













###### 20 






O Timothy, guard _and_ keep the deposit entrusted [to you]! Turn away from the irreverent babble _and_ godless chatter, with the vain _and_ empty _and_ worldly phrases, and the subtleties _and_ the contradictions in what is falsely called knowledge _and_ spiritual illumination. 













###### 21 






[For] by making such profession some have erred (missed the mark) as regards the faith. Grace (divine favor and blessing) be with you all! _Amen (so be it)._ ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

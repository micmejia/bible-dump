# 2 Corinthians 6

***














###### 1 






Laboring together [as God's fellow workers] with Him then, we beg of you not to receive the grace of God in vain [that [^a]merciful kindness by which God exerts His holy influence on souls and turns them to Christ, keeping and strengthening them--do not receive it to no purpose]. 













###### 2 






For He says, In the time of favor (of an assured welcome) I have listened to _and_ heeded your call, and I have helped you on the day of deliverance (the day of salvation). Behold, now is truly the time for a gracious welcome _and_ acceptance [of you from God]; behold, now is the day of salvation! 













###### 3 






We put no obstruction in anybody's way [we give no offense in anything], so that no fault may be found _and_ [our] ministry blamed _and_ discredited. 













###### 4 






But we commend ourselves in every way as [true] servants of God: through great endurance, in tribulation _and_ suffering, in hardships _and_ privations, in sore straits _and_ calamities, 













###### 5 






In beatings, imprisonments, riots, labors, sleepless watching, hunger; 













###### 6 






By innocence _and_ purity, knowledge _and_ spiritual insight, longsuffering _and_ patience, kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in unfeigned love; 













###### 7 






By [speaking] the word of truth, in the power of God, with the weapons of righteousness for the right hand [to attack] and for the left hand [to defend]; 













###### 8 






Amid honor and dishonor; in defaming _and_ evil report and in praise _and_ good report. [We are branded] as deceivers (impostors), and [yet vindicated as] truthful _and_ honest. 













###### 9 






[We are treated] as unknown _and_ ignored [by the world], and [yet we are] well-known _and_ recognized [by God and His people]; as dying, and yet here we are alive; as chastened by suffering and [yet] not killed; 













###### 10 






As grieved _and_ mourning, yet [we are] always rejoicing; as poor [ourselves, yet] bestowing riches on many; as having nothing, and [yet in reality] possessing all things. 













###### 11 






Our mouth is open to you, Corinthians [we are hiding nothing, keeping nothing back], and our heart is expanded wide [for you]! 













###### 12 






There is no lack of room for you in [our hearts], but you lack room in your own affections [for us]. 













###### 13 






By way of return then, do this for me--I speak as to children--open wide your hearts also [to us]. 













###### 14 






Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers [do not make mismated alliances with them or come under a different yoke with them, inconsistent with your faith]. For what partnership have right living _and_ right standing with God with iniquity _and_ lawlessness? Or how can light have fellowship with darkness? 













###### 15 






What harmony can there be between Christ and Belial [the devil]? Or what has a believer in common with an unbeliever? 













###### 16 






What agreement [can there be between] a temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God; even as God said, I will dwell in _and_ with _and_ among them and will walk in _and_ with _and_ among them, and I will be their God, and they shall be My people. 













###### 17 






So, come out from among [unbelievers], and separate (sever) yourselves from them, says the Lord, and touch not [any] unclean thing; then I will receive you kindly _and_ treat you with favor, 













###### 18 






And I will be a Father to you, and you shall be My sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

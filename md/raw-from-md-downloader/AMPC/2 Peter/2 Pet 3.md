# 2 Peter 3

***














###### 1 






Beloved, I am now writing you this second letter. In [both of] them I have stirred up your unsullied (sincere) mind by way of remembrance, 













###### 2 






That you should recall the predictions of the holy (consecrated, dedicated) prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior [given] through your apostles (His special messengers). 













###### 3 






To begin with, you must know _and_ understand this, that scoffers (mockers) will come in the last days with scoffing, [people who] walk after their own fleshly desires 













###### 4 






And say, Where is the promise of His coming? For since the forefathers fell asleep, all things have continued exactly as they did from the beginning of creation. 













###### 5 






For they willfully overlook _and_ forget this [fact], that the heavens [came into] existence long ago by the word of God, and the earth also which was formed out of water and by means of water, 













###### 6 






Through which the world that then [existed] was deluged with water and perished. 













###### 7 






But by the same word the present heavens and earth have been stored up (reserved) for fire, being kept until the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly people. 













###### 8 






Nevertheless, do not let this one fact escape you, beloved, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day. 













###### 9 






The Lord does not delay _and_ is not tardy _or_ slow about what He promises, according to some people's conception of slowness, but He is long-suffering (extraordinarily patient) toward you, not desiring that any should perish, but that all should turn to repentance. 













###### 10 






But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, and then the heavens will vanish (pass away) with a thunderous crash, and the [[^a]material] elements [of the universe] will be dissolved with fire, and the earth and the works that are upon it will be burned up. 













###### 11 






Since all these things are thus [^b]in the process of being dissolved, what kind of person ought [each of] you to be [in the meanwhile] in consecrated _and_ holy behavior and devout _and_ godly qualities, 













###### 12 






While you wait and earnestly long for (expect and hasten) the coming of the day of God by reason of which the flaming heavens will be dissolved, and the [[^c]material] elements [of the universe] will flare _and_ melt with fire? 













###### 13 






But we look for new heavens and a new earth according to His promise, in which righteousness (uprightness, freedom from sin, and right standing with God) is to abide. 













###### 14 






So, beloved, since you are expecting these things, be eager to be found by Him [at His coming] without spot or blemish and at peace [in serene confidence, [^d]free from fears and agitating passions and moral conflicts]. 













###### 15 






And consider that the long-suffering of our Lord [[^e]His slowness in avenging wrongs and judging the world] is salvation ([^f]that which is conducive to the soul's safety), even as our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you according to the spiritual insight given him, 













###### 16 






Speaking of this as he does in all of his letters. There are some things in those [epistles of Paul] that are difficult to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist _and_ misconstrue to their own [^g]utter destruction, just as [they distort and misinterpret] the rest of the Scriptures. 













###### 17 






Let me warn you therefore, beloved, that knowing these things beforehand, you should be on your guard, lest you be carried away by the error of lawless _and_ wicked [persons and] fall from your own [present] firm condition [your own steadfastness of mind]. 













###### 18 






But grow in grace (undeserved favor, spiritual strength) and [^h]recognition _and_ knowledge _and_ understanding of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ (the Messiah). To Him [be] glory (honor, majesty, and splendor) both now and to the day of eternity. Amen (so be it)! ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Acts 24

***














###### 1 






Five days later, the high priest Ananias came down [from Jerusalem to Caesarea] with some elders and a certain forensic advocate Tertullus [acting as spokesman and counsel]. They presented to the governor their evidence against Paul. 













###### 2 






And when he was called, Tertullus began the complaint [against him] by saying: Since through you we obtain _and_ enjoy much peace, and since by your foresight _and_ provision wonderful reforms (amendments and improvements) are introduced _and_ effected on behalf of this nation, 













###### 3 






In every way and in every place, most excellent Felix, we accept _and_ acknowledge this with deep appreciation _and_ with all gratitude. 













###### 4 






But not to hinder _or_ detain you too long, I beg you in your clemency _and_ courtesy _and_ kindness to grant us a brief _and_ [^a]concise hearing. 













###### 5 






For we have found this man a perfect pest (a real plague), an agitator _and_ source of disturbance to all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the [heretical, [^b]division-producing] sect of the Nazarenes. 













###### 6 






He also [even] tried to desecrate _and_ defile the temple, but we laid hands on him [^c]_and would have sentenced him by our Law_, 













###### 7 






_But the commandant Lysias came and took him from us with violence and force_, 













###### 8 






_And ordered his accusers to present themselves to you_. By examining _and_ cross-questioning him yourself, you will be able to ascertain the truth from him about all these things with which we charge him. 













###### 9 






The Jews also agreed _and_ joined in the accusation, declaring that all these things were exactly so. 













###### 10 






And when the governor had beckoned to Paul to speak, he answered: Because I know that for many years you have been a judge over this nation, I find it easier to make my defense _and_ do it cheerfully _and_ with good courage. 













###### 11 






As you can readily verify, it is not more than twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship; 













###### 12 






And neither in the temple nor in the synagogues nor in the city did they find me disputing with anybody or bringing together a seditious crowd. 













###### 13 






Neither can they present argument _or_ evidence to prove to you what they now bring against me. 













###### 14 






But this I confess to you, however, that in accordance with the Way [of the Lord], which they call a [heretical, division-producing] sect, I worship (serve) the God of our fathers, still persuaded of the truth of _and_ believing in _and_ placing full confidence in everything laid down in the Law [of Moses] _or_ written in the prophets; 













###### 15 






Having [the same] hope in God which these themselves hold _and_ look for, that there is to be a resurrection both of the righteous and the unrighteous (the just and the unjust). 













###### 16 






Therefore I always exercise _and_ discipline myself [mortifying my body, deadening my carnal affections, bodily appetites, and worldly desires, endeavoring in all respects] to have a clear (unshaken, blameless) conscience, void of offense toward God and toward men. 













###### 17 






Now after several years I came up [to Jerusalem] to bring to my people contributions of charity and offerings. 













###### 18 






While I was engaged in presenting these, they found me [occupied in the rites of purification] in the temple, without any crowd or uproar. But some Jews from [the province of] Asia [were there], 













###### 19 






Who ought to be here before you and to present their charges, if they have anything against me. 













###### 20 






Or else let these men themselves tell of what crime _or_ wrongdoing they found me guilty when I appeared before the council (Sanhedrin), 













###### 21 






Unless it be this one sentence which I cried out as I stood among them, In regard to the resurrection of the dead I am indicted _and_ on trial before you this day! 













###### 22 






But Felix, having a rather accurate understanding of the Way [of the Lord], put them off _and_ adjourned the trial, saying, When Lysias the commandant comes down, I will determine your case more fully. 













###### 23 






Then he ordered the centurion to keep [Paul] in custody, but to treat him with indulgence [giving him some liberty] and not to hinder his friends from ministering to his needs _and_ serving him. 













###### 24 






Some days later Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was a Jewess; and he sent for Paul and listened to him [talk] about faith in Christ Jesus. 













###### 25 






But as he continued to argue about uprightness, purity of life (the control of the passions), and the judgment to come, Felix became alarmed _and_ terrified and said, Go away for the present; when I have a convenient opportunity, I will send for you. 













###### 26 






At the same time he hoped to get money from Paul, for which reason he continued to send for him and was in his company _and_ conversed with him often. 













###### 27 






But when two years had gone by, Felix was succeeded in office by Porcius Festus; and wishing to gain favor with the Jews, Felix left Paul still a prisoner in chains. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

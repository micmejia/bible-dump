# Acts 5

***














###### 1 






But a certain man named Ananias with his wife Sapphira sold a piece of property, 













###### 2 






And with his wife's knowledge _and_ connivance he kept back _and_ wrongfully appropriated some of the proceeds, bringing only a part and putting it at the feet of the apostles. 













###### 3 






But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart that you should lie to _and_ attempt to deceive the Holy Spirit, and should [in violation of your promise] withdraw secretly _and_ appropriate to your own use part of the price from the sale of the land? 













###### 4 






As long as it remained unsold, was it not still your own? And [even] after it was sold, was not [the money] at your disposal _and_ under your control? Why then, is it that you have proposed _and_ purposed in your heart to do this thing? [How could you have the heart to do such a deed?] You have not [simply] lied to men [playing false and showing yourself utterly deceitful] but to God. 













###### 5 






Upon hearing these words, Ananias fell down and died. And great dread _and_ terror took possession of all who heard of it. 













###### 6 






And the young men arose and wrapped up [the body] and carried it out and buried it. 













###### 7 






Now after an interval of about three hours his wife came in, not having learned of what had happened. 













###### 8 






And Peter said to her, Tell me, did you sell the land for so much? Yes, she said, for so much. 













###### 9 






Then Peter said to her, How could you two have agreed _and_ conspired together to try to deceive the Spirit of the Lord? Listen! The feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out [also]. 













###### 10 






And instantly she fell down at his feet and died; and the young men entering found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her beside her husband. 













###### 11 






And the whole church and all others who heard of these things were appalled [great awe and strange terror and dread seized them]. 













###### 12 






Now by the hands of the apostles (special messengers) numerous _and_ startling signs _and_ wonders were being performed among the people. And by common consent they all met together [at the temple] in the covered porch (walk) called Solomon's. 













###### 13 






And none of those who were not of their number dared to join _and_ associate with them, but the people held them in high regard _and_ praised _and_ made much of them. 













###### 14 






More _and_ more there were being added to the Lord those who believed [those who acknowledged Jesus as their Savior and devoted themselves to Him joined and gathered with them], crowds both of men and of women, 













###### 15 






So that they [even] kept carrying out the sick into the streets and placing them on couches and sleeping pads, [in the hope] that as Peter passed by, at least his shadow might fall on some of them. 













###### 16 






And the people gathered also from the towns _and_ hamlets around Jerusalem, bringing the sick and those troubled with foul spirits, and they were all cured. 













###### 17 






But the high priest rose up and all who were his supporters, that is, the party of the Sadducees, and being filled with [^a]jealousy _and_ indignation _and_ rage, 













###### 18 






They seized and arrested the apostles (special messengers) and put them in the public jail. 













###### 19 






But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and, leading them out, said, 













###### 20 






Go, take your stand in the temple courts and declare to the people the whole doctrine concerning this Life (the eternal life which Christ revealed). 













###### 21 






And when they heard this, they accordingly went into the temple about daybreak and began to teach. Now the high priest and his supporters who were with him arrived and called together the council (Sanhedrin), even all the senate of the sons of Israel, and they sent to the prison to have [the apostles] brought. 













###### 22 






But when the attendants arrived there, they failed to find them in the jail; so they came back and reported, 













###### 23 






We found the prison quite safely locked up and the guards were on duty outside the doors, but when we opened [it], we found no one on the inside. 













###### 24 






Now when the military leader of the temple area and the chief priests heard these facts, they were much perplexed _and_ thoroughly at a loss about them, wondering into what this might grow. 













###### 25 






But some man came and reported to them, saying, Listen! The men whom you put in jail are standing [right here] in the temple and teaching the people! 













###### 26 






Then the military leader went with the attendants and brought [the prisoners], but without violence, for they dreaded the people lest they be stoned by them. 













###### 27 






So they brought them and set them before the council (Sanhedrin). And the high priest examined them by questioning, 













###### 28 






Saying, We definitely commanded _and_ strictly charged you not to teach in _or_ about this Name; yet here you have flooded Jerusalem with your doctrine and you intend to bring this [^b]Man's blood upon us. 













###### 29 






Then Peter and the apostles replied, We must obey God rather than men. 













###### 30 






The God of our forefathers raised up Jesus, Whom you killed by hanging Him on a tree (cross). 













###### 31 






God exalted Him to His right hand to be Prince _and_ Leader and Savior _and_ Deliverer _and_ Preserver, in order to grant repentance to Israel and to bestow forgiveness _and_ release from sins. 













###### 32 






And we are witnesses of these things, and the Holy Spirit is also, Whom God has bestowed on those who obey Him. 













###### 33 






Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart _and_ infuriated and wanted to kill the disciples. 













###### 34 






But a certain Pharisee in the council (Sanhedrin) named Gamaliel, a teacher of the Law, highly esteemed by all the people, standing up, ordered that the apostles be taken outside for a little while. 













###### 35 






Then he addressed them [the council, saying]: Men of Israel, take care in regard to what you propose to do concerning these men. 













###### 36 






For before our time there arose Theudas, asserting himself to be a person of importance, with whom a number of men allied themselves, about 400; but he was killed and all who had listened to _and_ adhered to him were scattered and brought to nothing. 













###### 37 






And after this one rose up Judas the Galilean, [who led an uprising] during the time of the census, and drew away a popular following after him; he also perished and all his adherents were scattered. 













###### 38 






Now in the present case let me say to you, stand off (withdraw) from these men and let them alone. For if this doctrine _or_ purpose or undertaking _or_ movement is of human origin, it will fail (be overthrown and come to nothing); 













###### 39 






But if it is of God, you will not be able to stop _or_ overthrow _or_ destroy them; you might even be found fighting against God! 













###### 40 






So, convinced by him, they took his advice; and summoning the apostles, they flogged them and sternly forbade them to speak in _or_ about the name of Jesus, and allowed them to go. 













###### 41 






So they went out from the presence of the council (Sanhedrin), rejoicing that they were being counted worthy [dignified by the indignity] to suffer shame _and_ be exposed to disgrace for [the sake of] His name. 













###### 42 






Yet [in spite of the threats] they never ceased for a single day, both in the temple area and at home, to teach _and_ to proclaim the good news (Gospel) of Jesus [as] the Christ (the Messiah). ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Acts 6

***














###### 1 






Now about this time, when the number of the disciples was greatly increasing, complaint was made by the Hellenists (the Greek-speaking Jews) against the [native] Hebrews because their widows were being overlooked _and_ neglected in the daily ministration (distribution of relief). 













###### 2 






So the Twelve [apostles] convened the multitude of the disciples and said, It is not seemly _or_ desirable _or_ right that we should have to give up _or_ neglect [preaching] the Word of God in order to attend to serving at tables _and_ superintending the distribution of food. 













###### 3 






Therefore select out from among yourselves, brethren, seven men of good _and_ attested character _and_ repute, full of the [Holy] Spirit and wisdom, whom we may assign to look after this business _and_ duty. 













###### 4 






But we will continue to devote ourselves steadfastly to prayer and the ministry of the Word. 













###### 5 






And the suggestion pleased the whole assembly, and they selected Stephen, a man full of faith (a strong and welcome belief that Jesus is the Messiah) and full of _and_ controlled by the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte (convert) from Antioch. 













###### 6 






These they presented to the apostles, who after prayer laid their hands on them. 













###### 7 






And the message of God kept on spreading, and the number of disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem; and [besides] a large number of the priests were obedient to the faith [in Jesus as the Messiah, through Whom is obtained eternal salvation in the kingdom of God]. 













###### 8 






Now Stephen, full of grace (divine blessing and favor) and power (strength and ability) worked great wonders and signs (miracles) among the people. 













###### 9 






However, some of those who belonged to the synagogue of the Freedmen (freed Jewish slaves), as it was called, and [of the synagogues] of the Cyrenians and of the Alexandrians and of those from Cilicia and [the province of] Asia, arose [and undertook] to debate _and_ dispute with Stephen. 













###### 10 






But they were not able to resist the intelligence _and_ the wisdom and [the inspiration of] the Spirit with which _and_ by Whom he spoke. 













###### 11 






So they [secretly] instigated _and_ instructed men to say, We have heard this man speak, using slanderous _and_ abusive _and_ blasphemous language against Moses and God. 













###### 12 






[Thus] they incited the people as well as the elders and the scribes, and they came upon Stephen and arrested him and took him before the council (Sanhedrin). 













###### 13 






And they brought forward false witnesses who asserted, This man never stops making statements against this sacred place and the Law [of Moses]; 













###### 14 






For we have heard him say that this Jesus the Nazarene will tear down _and_ destroy this place, and will alter the institutions _and_ usages which Moses transmitted to us. 













###### 15 






Then all who sat in the council (Sanhedrin), as they gazed intently at Stephen, saw that his face had the appearance of the face of an angel. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

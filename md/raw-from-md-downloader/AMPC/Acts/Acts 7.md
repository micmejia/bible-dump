# Acts 7

***














###### 1 






And the high priest asked [Stephen], Are these charges true? 













###### 2 






And he answered, Brethren and fathers, listen to me! The God of glory appeared to our forefather Abraham when he was still in Mesopotamia, before he [went to] live in Haran, 













###### 3 






And He said to him, Leave your own country and your relatives and come into the land (region) that I will point out to you. 













###### 4 






So then he went forth from the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. And from there, after his father died, [God] transferred him to this country in which you are now dwelling. 













###### 5 






Yet He gave him no inheritable property in it, [no] not even enough ground to set his foot on; but He promised that He would give it to Him for a [^a]permanent possession and to his descendants after him, even though [as yet] he had no child. 













###### 6 






And this is [in effect] what God told him: That his descendants would be aliens (strangers) in a land belonging to other people, who would bring them into bondage and ill-treat them 400 years. 













###### 7 






But I will judge the nation to whom they will be slaves, said God, and after that they will escape _and_ come forth and worship Me in this [very] place. 













###### 8 






And [God] made with Abraham a covenant (an agreement to be religiously observed) [^b]of which circumcision was the seal. And under these circumstances [Abraham] became the father of Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac [did so] when he became the father of Jacob, and Jacob [when each of his sons was born], the twelve patriarchs. 













###### 9 






And the patriarchs [Jacob's sons], boiling with envy _and_ hatred _and_ anger, sold Joseph into slavery in Egypt; but God was with him, 













###### 10 






And delivered him from all his distressing afflictions and won him goodwill _and_ favor and wisdom _and_ understanding in the sight of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who made him governor over Egypt and all his house. 













###### 11 






Then there came a famine over all of Egypt and Canaan, with great distress, and our forefathers could find no fodder [for the cattle] _or_ vegetable sustenance [for their households]. 













###### 12 






But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent forth our forefathers [to go there on their] first trip. 













###### 13 






And on their second visit Joseph revealed himself to his brothers, and the family of Joseph became known to Pharaoh _and_ his origin _and_ race. 













###### 14 






And Joseph sent an invitation calling to himself Jacob his father and all his kindred, seventy-five persons in all. 













###### 15 






And Jacob went down into Egypt, where he himself died, as did [also] our forefathers; 













###### 16 






And their [^c]bodies [Jacob's and Joseph's] were taken back to Shechem and laid in the tomb which Abraham had purchased for a sum of [silver] money from the sons of Hamor in Shechem. 













###### 17 






But as the time for the fulfillment of the promise drew near which God had made to Abraham, the [Hebrew] people increased and multiplied in Egypt, 













###### 18 






Until [the time when] there arose over Egypt another _and_ a different king who did not know Joseph [neither knowing his history and services nor recognizing his merits]. 













###### 19 






He dealt treacherously with _and_ defrauded our race; he abused _and_ oppressed our forefathers, forcing them to expose their babies so that they might not be kept alive. 













###### 20 






At this juncture Moses was born, and was exceedingly beautiful in God's sight. For three months he was nurtured in his father's house; 













###### 21 






Then when he was exposed [to perish], the daughter of Pharaoh rescued him and took him _and_ reared him as her own son. 













###### 22 






So Moses was educated in all the wisdom _and_ culture of the Egyptians, and he was mighty (powerful) in his speech and deeds. 













###### 23 






And when he was in his fortieth year, it came into his heart to visit his kinsmen the children of Israel [[^d]to help them and to care for them]. 













###### 24 






And on seeing one of them being unjustly treated, he defended the oppressed man and avenged him by striking down the Egyptian _and_ slaying [him]. 













###### 25 






He expected his brethren to understand that God was granting them deliverance by his hand [taking it for granted that they would accept him]; but they did not understand. 













###### 26 






Then on the next day he [^e]suddenly appeared to some who were quarreling _and_ fighting among themselves, and he urged them to make peace _and_ become reconciled, saying, Men, you are brethren; why do you abuse _and_ wrong one another? 













###### 27 






Whereupon the man who was abusing his neighbor pushed [Moses] aside, saying, Who appointed you a ruler (umpire) and a judge over us? 













###### 28 






Do you intend to slay me as you slew the Egyptian yesterday? 













###### 29 






At that reply Moses sought safety by flight and he was an exile _and_ an alien in the country of Midian, where he became the father of two sons. 













###### 30 






And when forty years had gone by, there appeared to him in the wilderness (desert) of Mount Sinai an angel, in the flame of a burning bramblebush. 













###### 31 






When Moses saw it, he was astonished _and_ marveled at the sight; but when he went close to investigate, there came to him the voice of the Lord, saying, 













###### 32 






I am the God of your forefathers, the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob. And Moses trembled _and_ was so terrified that he did not venture to look. 













###### 33 






Then the Lord said to him, Remove the sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground _and_ worthy of veneration. 













###### 34 






Because I have most assuredly seen the abuse _and_ oppression of My people in Egypt and have heard their sighing _and_ groaning, I have come down to rescue them. So, now come! I will send you back to Egypt [as My messenger]. 













###### 35 






It was this very Moses whom they had denied (disowned and rejected), saying, Who made you our ruler (referee) and judge? whom God sent to be a ruler and deliverer _and_ redeemer, by _and_ with the [protecting and helping] hand of the Angel that appeared to him in the bramblebush. 













###### 36 






He it was who led them forth, having worked wonders and signs in Egypt and at the Red Sea and during the forty years in the wilderness (desert). 













###### 37 






It was this [very] Moses who said to the children of Israel, God will raise up for you a Prophet from among your brethren as He raised me up. 













###### 38 






This is he who in the assembly in the wilderness (desert) was the go-between for the Angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai and our forefathers, and he received living oracles (words that still live) to be handed down to us. 













###### 39 






[And yet] our forefathers determined not to be subject to him [refusing to listen to _or_ obey him]; but thrusting him aside they rejected him, and in their hearts yearned for _and_ turned back to Egypt. 













###### 40 






And they said to Aaron, Make us gods who shall [be our leaders and] go before us; as for this Moses who led us forth from the land of Egypt--we have no knowledge of what has happened to him. 













###### 41 






And they [even] made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice to the idol and made merry _and_ exulted in the work of their [own] hands. 













###### 42 






But God turned [away from them] and delivered them up to worship _and_ serve the host (stars) of heaven, as it is written in the book of the prophets: Did you [really] offer to Me slain beasts and sacrifices for forty years in the wilderness (desert), O house of Israel? 













###### 43 






[No!] You took up the tent (the portable temple) of Moloch _and_ carried it [with you], and the star of the god Rephan, the images which you [yourselves] made that you might worship them; and I will remove you [carrying you away into exile] beyond Babylon. 













###### 44 






Our forefathers had the tent (tabernacle) of witness in the wilderness, even as He Who directed Moses to make it had ordered, according to the pattern _and_ model he had seen. 













###### 45 






Our forefathers in turn brought it [this tent of witness] in [with them into the land] with Joshua when they dispossessed the nations which God drove out before the face of our forefathers. [So it remained here] until the time of David, 













###### 46 






Who found grace (favor and spiritual blessing) in the sight of God and prayed that he might be allowed to find a dwelling place for the God of Jacob. 













###### 47 






But it was Solomon who built a house for Him. 













###### 48 






However, the Most High does not dwell in houses _and_ temples made with hands; as the prophet says, 













###### 49 






Heaven [is] My throne, and earth the footstool for My feet. What [kind of] house can you build for Me, says the Lord, or what is the place in which I can rest? 













###### 50 






Was it not My hand that made all these things? 













###### 51 






You stubborn _and_ stiff-necked people, still heathen _and_ uncircumcised in heart and ears, you are always [^f]actively resisting the Holy Spirit. As your forefathers [were], so you [are and so you do]! 













###### 52 






Which of the prophets did your forefathers not persecute? And they slew those who proclaimed beforehand the coming of the Righteous One, Whom you now have betrayed and murdered-- 













###### 53 






You who received the Law as it was ordained _and_ set in order _and_ delivered by angels, and [yet] you did not obey it! 













###### 54 






Now upon hearing these things, they [the Jews] were cut to the heart _and_ infuriated, and they ground their teeth against [Stephen]. 













###### 55 






But he, full of the Holy Spirit _and_ controlled by Him, gazed into heaven and saw the glory (the splendor and majesty) of God, and Jesus standing at God's right hand; 













###### 56 






And he said, Look! I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing at God's right hand! 













###### 57 






But they raised a great shout and put their hands over their ears and rushed together upon him. 













###### 58 






Then they dragged him out of the city and began to stone him, and the witnesses placed their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul. 













###### 59 






And while they were stoning Stephen, he prayed, Lord Jesus, receive _and_ accept _and_ welcome my spirit! 













###### 60 






And falling on his knees, he cried out loudly, Lord, fix not this sin upon them [lay it not to their charge]! And when he had said this, he fell asleep [^g][in death]. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

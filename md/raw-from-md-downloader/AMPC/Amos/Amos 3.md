# Amos 3

***














###### 1 






Hear this word that the Lord has spoken against you, O children of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt: 













###### 2 






You only have I known (chosen, sympathized with, and loved) of all the families of the earth; therefore I will visit upon you all your wickedness _and_ punish you for all your iniquities. 













###### 3 






Do two walk together except they make an appointment _and_ have agreed? 













###### 4 






Will a lion roar in the forest when he has no prey? Will a young lion cry out of his den if he has taken nothing? 













###### 5 






Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth where there is no trap for him? Does a trap spring up from the ground when nothing at all has sprung it? 













###### 6 






Shall a trumpet be blown in the city and the people not be alarmed _and_ afraid? Shall misfortune _or_ evil occur [as punishment] and the Lord has not caused it? 













###### 7 






Surely the Lord God will do nothing [^a]without revealing His secret to His servants the prophets. 













###### 8 






The lion has roared; who will not fear? The Lord God has spoken; who can but prophesy? 













###### 9 






Publish to the strongholds in Ashdod [Philistia] and to the strongholds in the land of Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria, and behold what great tumults (confusion and disorder) are in her and what oppressions are in the midst of her. 













###### 10 






For they know not how to do right, says the Lord, they who store up violence and robbery in their strongholds. 













###### 11 






Therefore thus says the Lord God: An adversary shall surround the land, and he shall bring down your defenses from you and your strongholds shall be plundered. 













###### 12 






Thus says the Lord: As the shepherd rescues out of the mouth of the lion two legs or a piece of an ear [of a sheep], so shall the children of Israel who dwell in Samaria be rescued with the corner of a couch and [part of] the damask covering of a bed. 













###### 13 






Hear and bear witness in the house of Jacob, says the Lord God, the God of hosts, 













###### 14 






That in the day when I visit Israel's transgressions upon him I will also visit [with punishment] the altars of Bethel [with its golden calf], and the horns of the altar shall be cut off and fall to the ground. 













###### 15 






And I will smite the winter house with the summer house, and the houses of ivory shall perish and the many _and_ great houses shall come to an end, says the Lord. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

He warned Noah of the coming flood (Gen. 6:13ff.); Abraham and Lot of the future destruction of Sodom (Gen. 18:17; 19:14); Joseph of the seven-year famine (Gen. 41:30); Moses of the ten plagues on Egypt (Exod. 7:1ff.); Jonah of the destruction of Nineveh (Jonah 1:2; 3:4); Amos of the downfall of Syria, Philistia, Tyre, Edom, Ammon, Moab, Judah, and Israel (Amos 1 and 2). Various prophets were told in detail about the final events in connection with the captivities of the chosen people, and in every case the warnings were startlingly executed. Jonah announced the destruction of Nineveh, but judgment was postponed following repentance. When later generations of Ninevites backslid and reverted to extreme wickedness, the warning of Nahum was carried out completely against them. Christâ€™s coming was foretold throughout the Old Testament, from Genesis to Malachi. Equally plain and inevitable of fulfillment are the warnings of Jesus and the prophets concerning the future that each day comes nearer to every nation on earth.

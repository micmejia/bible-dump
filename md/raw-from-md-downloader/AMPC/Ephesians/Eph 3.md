# Ephesians 3

***














###### 1 






For this reason [[^a]because I preached that you are thus built up together], I, Paul, [am] the prisoner of Jesus the Christ [^b]for the sake _and_ on behalf of you Gentiles-- 













###### 2 






Assuming that you have heard of the stewardship of God's grace (His unmerited favor) that was entrusted to me [to dispense to you] for your benefit, 













###### 3 






[And] that the mystery (secret) was made known to me _and_ I was allowed to comprehend it by direct revelation, as I already briefly wrote you. 













###### 4 






When you read this you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ. 













###### 5 






[This mystery] was never disclosed to human beings in past generations as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles (consecrated messengers) and prophets by the [Holy] Spirit. 













###### 6 






[It is this:] that the Gentiles are now to be fellow heirs [with the Jews], members of the same body and joint partakers [sharing] in the same divine promise in Christ through [their acceptance of] the glad tidings (the Gospel). 













###### 7 






Of this [Gospel] I was made a minister according to the gift of God's free grace (undeserved favor) which was bestowed on me by the exercise (the working in all its effectiveness) of His power. 













###### 8 






To me, though I am the very least of all the saints (God's consecrated people), this grace (favor, privilege) was granted _and_ graciously entrusted: to proclaim to the Gentiles the unending (boundless, fathomless, incalculable, and exhaustless) riches of Christ [wealth which no human being could have searched out], 













###### 9 






Also to enlighten all men _and_ make plain to them what is the plan [regarding the Gentiles and providing for the salvation of all men] of the mystery kept hidden through the ages _and_ concealed until now in [the mind of] God Who created all things _by Christ Jesus_. 













###### 10 






[The purpose is] that through the church the [^c]complicated, many-sided wisdom of God in all its infinite variety _and_ innumerable aspects might now be made known to the angelic rulers and authorities (principalities and powers) in the heavenly sphere. 













###### 11 






This is in accordance with the terms of the eternal _and_ timeless purpose which He has realized _and_ carried into effect in [the person of] Christ Jesus our Lord, 













###### 12 






In Whom, because of our faith in Him, we dare to have the boldness (courage and confidence) of free access (an unreserved approach to God with freedom and without fear). 













###### 13 






So I ask you not to lose heart [not to faint or become despondent through fear] at what I am suffering in your behalf. [Rather glory in it] for it is an honor to you. 













###### 14 






For this reason [[^d]seeing the greatness of this plan by which you are built together in Christ], I bow my knees before the Father _of our Lord Jesus Christ_, 













###### 15 






For Whom every family in heaven and on earth is named [that Father from Whom all fatherhood takes its title and derives its name]. 













###### 16 






May He grant you out of the rich treasury of His glory to be strengthened _and_ reinforced with mighty power in the inner man by the [Holy] Spirit [Himself indwelling your innermost being and personality]. 













###### 17 






May Christ through your faith [actually] dwell (settle down, abide, make His permanent home) in your hearts! May you be rooted deep in love _and_ founded securely on love, 













###### 18 






That you may have the power _and_ be strong to apprehend _and_ grasp with all the saints [God's devoted people, the experience of that love] what is the breadth and length and height and depth [of it]; 













###### 19 






[That you may really come] to know [practically, [^e]through experience for yourselves] the love of Christ, which far surpasses [^f]mere knowledge [without experience]; that you may be filled [through all your being] [^g]unto all the fullness of God [may have the richest measure of the divine Presence, and [^h]become a body wholly filled and flooded with God Himself]! 













###### 20 






Now to Him Who, by (in consequence of) the [action of His] power that is at work within us, is able to [carry out His purpose and] do superabundantly, far over _and_ above all that we [dare] ask or think [infinitely beyond our highest prayers, desires, thoughts, hopes, or dreams]-- 













###### 21 






To Him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations forever and ever. Amen (so be it). ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

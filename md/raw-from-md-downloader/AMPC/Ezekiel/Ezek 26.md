# Ezekiel 26

***














###### 1 






And in the eleventh year, on the first day of the month [after the carrying away of King Jehoiachin], the word of the Lord came to me, saying, 













###### 2 






Son of man, because Tyre has said against Jerusalem, Aha! She is broken that has been the gate of the people; she is open to me [Tyre]; I shall become full now that she is desolate _and_ a wasteland, 













###### 3 






Therefore thus says the Lord God: Behold, I am against you, O Tyre, and will cause many nations to come up against you as the sea mounts up by its waves. 













###### 4 






And they shall destroy the walls of Tyre and break down her towers; I will also [^a]scrape her dust from her and make her bare like the top of a rock. 













###### 5 






Her island in the midst of the sea shall become a place for the spreading of nets, for I have spoken it, says the Lord God; and she shall become a prey _and_ a spoil to the nations. 













###### 6 






And Tyre's daughters [her towns and villages on the mainland] in the level place shall be slain by the sword, and they shall know (understand and realize) that I am the Lord [the Sovereign Ruler, Who calls forth loyalty and obedient service]. 













###### 7 






For thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will bring from the north upon Tyre [^b]Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, a king of kings, with horses and chariots and with horsemen and a host of many people. 













###### 8 






He shall slay with the sword your daughters [the towns and villages] in the level area [on the mainland], and he shall make a fortified wall against you and cast up a siege mound against you and raise up a roof of bucklers _and_ shields as a defense against you. 













###### 9 






And he shall set his battering engines in shock against your walls, and with his axes he will break down your towers. 













###### 10 






Because of the great number of [Nebuchadrezzar's] horses, their dust will cover you; your walls [O Tyre] will shake at the noise of the horsemen and of the wagon wheels and of the chariots, when he enters into your gates as men enter into the city in whose walls there has been made a breach. 













###### 11 






With the hoofs of his horses [Nebuchadrezzar] will trample all your streets; he will slay your people with the sword and your strong pillars _or_ obelisks will fall to the ground. 













###### 12 






And [your adversaries] shall make a spoil of your riches and make booty of your merchandise. And they shall break down your walls and destroy your pleasant houses, and they shall lay the stones and the timber and the very dust from your demolished city out in the midst of the water [between the island and the mainland city site to make a causeway]. 













###### 13 






And I will cause the noise of your songs to cease, and the sound of your lyres shall be no more heard. 













###### 14 






And I will make you [Tyre] a [^c]bare rock; you shall be a place upon which to spread nets; you shall never be rebuilt, for I the Lord have spoken it, says the Lord God. 













###### 15 






Thus says the Lord God to Tyre: Shall not the isles _and_ coastlands shake at the sound of your fall when the wounded groan, when the slaughter is made in the midst of you? 













###### 16 






Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones and lay aside their robes and strip off their embroidered garments; they shall clothe themselves with tremblings; they shall sit upon the ground and shall tremble every moment and be astonished at you _and_ appalled. 













###### 17 






They shall take up a lamentation over you and say to you, How you are destroyed _and_ vanished, O renowned city that was won from the seas _and_ inhabited by seafaring men, renowned city that was mighty on the sea, she and her inhabitants who caused their terror to fall upon all who dwell there! 













###### 18 






Now the isles _and_ coastlands tremble in the day of your fall; yes, the isles that are in the sea are troubled _and_ dismayed at your departure. 













###### 19 






For thus says the Lord God: When I make you a desolate city like the cities that are not inhabited, when I bring up the deep over you and great waters cover you, 













###### 20 






Then I will thrust you down with those who descend into the pit (the place of the dead) to the people of olden times, and I will make you [Tyre] to dwell in the lower world like the places that were desolate of old, with those who go down to the pit, that you be not inhabited or shed forth your glory _and_ renown in the land of the living. 













###### 21 






I will make you a terror [bring you to a dreadful end] and you shall be no more. Though you be sought, yet you shall never be found again, says the Lord God. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

The conqueror destroyed the city on the mainland and left. But more than two centuries later, Alexander the Great took the ruins of the old city, even scraping up the dust, and made a causeway to the island, thus fulfilling the prophecy exactly. [^b]: Ezekiel 26:7 See footnote on Jer. 21:2. [^c]: Ezekiel 26:14 According to Herodotus, Tyre’s history began in 2750 b.c. It was a fortified city in Joshua’s time (Josh. 19:29), and later became a great maritime commercial center (Isa. 23:8). Yet Jeremiah (27:2-7; 47:4) and Ezekiel (26:3-21; 28:6-10) foretold utter destruction for Tyre, naming not less than twenty-five separate details, each of which in the following centuries came true literally. Mathematicians have estimated, according to the “Law of Compound Probabilities,” that if a prophecy concerning a person, place, or event has twenty-five details beyond the possibility of human collusion, calculation, coincidence, and comprehension, there is only one chance in more than thirty-three and one-half million of its accidental fulfillment. Yet Tyre’s history at the hands of Nebuchadnezzar, and then more than two centuries later at the hands of Alexander the Great, and centuries after that at the hands of the Crusaders, was the striking fulfillment of each detail of the prophets’ forecasts. No other city in the world’s history could have fulfilled them. The authenticity and credibility of God’s Word leaves no chance for sane denial. See footnote on Zeph. 2:7 for information about a similar fulfillment of details of Bible prophecy with regard to Palestine and to the end of Christ’s life.

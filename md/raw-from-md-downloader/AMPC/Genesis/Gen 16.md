# Genesis 16

***














###### 1 






Now Sarai, Abram's wife, had borne him no children. She had an Egyptian maid whose name was Hagar. 













###### 2 






And Sarai said to Abram, See here, the Lord has restrained me from bearing [children]. I am asking you to have intercourse with my maid; it may be that I can obtain children by her. And Abram listened to _and_ heeded what Sarai said. 













###### 3 






So Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar her Egyptian maid, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his [secondary] wife. 













###### 4 






And he had intercourse with Hagar, and she became pregnant; and when she saw that she was with child, she looked with contempt upon her mistress _and_ despised her. 













###### 5 






Then Sarai said to Abram, May [the responsibility for] my wrong _and_ deprivation of rights be upon you! I gave my maid into your bosom, and when she saw that she was with child, I was contemptible _and_ despised in her eyes. May the Lord be the judge between you and me. 













###### 6 






But Abram said to Sarai, See here, your maid is in your hands _and_ power; do as you please with her. And when Sarai dealt severely with her, humbling _and_ afflicting her, she [Hagar] fled from her. 













###### 7 






But [^a]the Angel of the Lord found her by a spring of water in the wilderness on the road to Shur. 













###### 8 






And He said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, where did you come from, and where are you intending to go? And she said, I am running away from my mistress Sarai. 













###### 9 






The Angel of the Lord said to her, Go back to your mistress and [humbly] submit to her control. 













###### 10 






Also the Angel of the Lord said to her, I will multiply your descendants exceedingly, so that they shall not be numbered for multitude. 













###### 11 






And the Angel of the Lord continued, See now, you are with child and shall bear a son, and shall call his name Ishmael [God hears], because the Lord has heard _and_ paid attention to your affliction. 













###### 12 






And he [Ishmael] will be as a [^b]wild ass among men; his hand will be against every man and every man's hand against him, and he will live to the east _and_ on the borders of all his kinsmen. 













###### 13 






So she called the name of the Lord Who spoke to her, You are a God of seeing, for she said, Have I [not] even here [in the wilderness] looked upon Him Who sees me [and lived]? _Or_ have I here also seen [the future purposes or designs of] Him Who sees me? 













###### 14 






Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi [A well to the Living One Who sees me]; it is [^c]between Kadesh and Bered. 













###### 15 






And Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram called the name of his son whom Hagar bore [^d]Ishmael. 













###### 16 






Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

But it is obvious that the “Angel of the Lord” is a distinct person in Himself from God the Father (Gen. 24:7; Exod. 23:20; Zech. 1:12, 13 and other passages). Nor does the “Angel of the Lord” appear again after Christ came in human form. He must of necessity be One of the “three-in-one” Godhead. The “Angel of the Lord” is the visible Lord God of the Old Testament, as Jesus Christ is of the New Testament. Thus His deity is clearly portrayed in the Old Testament. _The Cambridge Bible_ observes, “There is a fascinating forecast of the coming Messiah, breaking through the dimness with amazing consistency, at intervals from Genesis to Malachi. Abraham, Moses, the slave girl Hagar, the impoverished farmer Gideon, even the humble parents of Samson, had seen and talked with Him centuries before the herald angels proclaimed His birth in Bethlehem.” [^b]: Genesis 16:12 “Nothing can be more descriptive of the wandering, lawless, freebooting life of the Arabs than this. From the beginning to the present they have kept their independence, and God preserves them as a lasting monument of His providential care and an incontestable argument of the truth of divine revelation. Had the books of Moses no other proof of their divine origin, the account of Ishmael and the prophecy concerning his descendants during a period of nearly 4,000 years would be sufficient. To attempt to refute it would be a most ridiculous presumption and folly” (Adam Clarke, _The Holy Bible with A Commentary_). [^c]: Genesis 16:14 This, “it is between Kadesh and Bered,” is further proof of the antiquity of the original names, since the place had to be identified to the reader in the time of Moses. [^d]: Genesis 16:15 Ishmael was the first person whom God named before his birth (Gen. 16:11). Others were: Isaac (Gen. 17:19); Josiah (I Kings 13:2); Solomon (I Chron. 22:9); Jesus (Matt. 1:21); and John the Baptist (Luke 1:13).

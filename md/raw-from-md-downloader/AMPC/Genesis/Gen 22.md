# Genesis 22

***














###### 1 






After these events, God tested _and_ proved Abraham and said to him, Abraham! And he said, Here I am. 













###### 2 






[God] said, Take now your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the region of Moriah; and offer him there as a burnt offering upon one of the mountains of which I will tell you. 













###### 3 






So Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him and his son Isaac; and he split the wood for the burnt offering, and then began the trip to the place of which God had told him. 













###### 4 






On the third day Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance. 













###### 5 






And Abraham said to his servants, Settle down _and_ stay here with the donkey, and I and the young man will go yonder and worship and [^a]come again to you. 













###### 6 






Then Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and laid it on [the shoulders of] Isaac his son, and he took the fire (the firepot) in his own hand, and a knife; and the two of them went on together. 













###### 7 






And Isaac said to Abraham, My father! And he said, Here I am, my son. [Isaac] said, See, here are the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for the burnt sacrifice? 













###### 8 






Abraham said, My son, [^b]God Himself will provide a lamb for the burnt offering. So the two went on together. 













###### 9 






When they came to the place of which God had told him, Abraham built an altar there; then he laid the wood in order and [^c]bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar on the wood. 













###### 10 






And Abraham stretched forth his hand and took hold of the knife to slay his son. 













###### 11 






But the [^d]Angel of the Lord called to him from heaven and said, Abraham, Abraham! He answered, Here I am. 













###### 12 






And He said, Do not lay your hand on the lad or do anything to him; for now I know that you fear _and_ revere God, since you have not held back from Me _or_ begrudged giving Me your son, your only son. 













###### 13 






Then Abraham looked up _and_ glanced around, and behold, behind him was a ram caught in a thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up for a burnt offering _and_ an ascending sacrifice instead of his son! 













###### 14 






So Abraham called the name of that place The Lord Will Provide. And it is said to this day, On the mount of the Lord it will be provided. 













###### 15 






The Angel of the Lord called to Abraham from heaven a second time 













###### 16 






And said, I have sworn by Myself, says the Lord, that since you have done this and have not withheld [from Me] _or_ begrudged [giving Me] your son, your only son, 













###### 17 






In blessing I will bless you and in multiplying I will multiply your descendants like the stars of the heavens and like the sand on the seashore. And your Seed (Heir) will possess the gate of His enemies, 













###### 18 






And in your Seed [[^e]Christ] shall all the nations of the earth be blessed _and_ [by Him] bless themselves, because you have heard _and_ obeyed My voice. 













###### 19 






So Abraham returned to his servants, and they rose up and went with him to Beersheba; there Abraham lived. 













###### 20 






Now after these things, it was told Abraham, Milcah has also borne children to your brother Nahor: 













###### 21 






Uz the firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram, 













###### 22 






Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel. 













###### 23 






Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham's brother. 













###### 24 






And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

He believed God, Who had promised him that this young man’s posterity was to inherit the promises made to Abraham (Gen. 12:2, 3). [^b]: Genesis 22:8 We must not suppose that this was the language merely of faith and obedience. Abraham spoke prophetically, and referred to that Lamb of God which He had provided for Himself, Who in the fullness of time would take away the sin of the world, and of Whom Isaac was a most expressive type (Adam Clarke, _The Holy Bible with A Commentary_). For Abraham was a prophet (Gen. 20:7). Jesus said Abraham hoped for “My day [My incarnation]; and he did see it and was delighted” (John 8:56). [^c]: Genesis 22:9 Isaac, who was perhaps twenty-five years old (according to the ancient historian Josephus), shared his father’s confidence in God’s promise. Was not his very existence the result of God keeping His word? (Gen. 17:15-17.) [^d]: Genesis 22:11 See footnote on Gen. 16:7. [^e]: Genesis 22:18 We have the authority of the apostle Paul (Gal. 3:8, 16, 18) to restrict this promise to our blessed Lord, Who was the Seed through Whom alone all God’s blessings of providence, mercy, grace, and glory should be conveyed to the nations of the earth (Adam Clarke, _The Holy Bible with A Commentary_).

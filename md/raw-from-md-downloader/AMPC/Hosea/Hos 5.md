# Hosea 5

***














###### 1 






Hear this, O you priests! And listen, O house of Israel! And give ear, O house of the king! For the judgment pronounced pertains to you _and_ is meant for you, because you have been a snare at Mizpah and a net spread upon Tabor [military strongholds on either side of the Jordan River]. 













###### 2 






The revolters are deeply sunk in corruption _and_ slaughter, but I [the Lord God] am a rebuke _and_ a chastisement for them all. 













###### 3 






I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from Me; for now, O Ephraim, you have played the harlot _and_ have worshiped idols; Israel is defiled. 













###### 4 






Their doings will not permit them to return to their God, for the spirit of harlotry is within them and they know not the Lord [they do not recognize, appreciate, give heed to, or cherish the Lord]. 













###### 5 






But the pride _and_ self-reliance of Israel testifies before his [own] face. Therefore shall [all] Israel, and [especially] Ephraim [the northern ten tribes], totter _and_ fall in their iniquity _and_ guilt, and Judah shall stumble _and_ fall with them. 













###### 6 






They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the Lord [inquiring for and requiring Him], but they will not find Him; He has withdrawn Himself from them. 













###### 7 






They have dealt faithlessly _and_ treacherously with the Lord [their espoused Husband], for they have borne alien children. Now shall a [single] New Moon (one month) devour them with their fields. 













###### 8 






Blow the horn in Gibeah and the trumpet in Ramah [both lofty hills on Benjamin's northern border]. Sound the alarm at Beth-aven: [the enemy is] behind you _and_ after you, O Benjamin [be on your guard]! 













###### 9 






Ephraim shall become a desolation in the day of rebuke _and_ punishment. Among the tribes of Israel I declare what shall surely be. 













###### 10 






The princes of Judah are like those who remove the landmark [the barrier between right and wrong]; I will pour out My wrath upon them like water. 













###### 11 






Ephraim is oppressed; he is broken _and_ crushed by [divine] judgment, because he was content to walk after idols (images) _and_ man's [evil] command [^a](_vanities and filth_). 













###### 12 






Therefore I am like a moth to Ephraim and like dry rot to the house of Judah [in My judgment against them]. 













###### 13 






When Ephraim saw his sickness and Judah saw his wound, then Ephraim went to Assyria and sent to [Assyria's] great King Jareb [for help]. Yet he cannot heal you nor will he cure you of your wound [received in divine judgment]. 













###### 14 






For I will be to Ephraim like a lion, and like a young lion to the house of Judah. I, even I, will rend and go on [rending]; I will carry off and there will be no one to deliver. 













###### 15 






I will return to My place [on high] until they acknowledge their offense _and_ feel their guilt and seek My face; in their affliction _and_ distress they will seek, inquire for, _and_ require Me earnestly, saying, ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

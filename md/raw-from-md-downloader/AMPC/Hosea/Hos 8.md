# Hosea 8

***














###### 1 






Set the trumpet to your lips! [The enemy] comes as a [great] vulture against the house of the Lord, because they have broken My covenant and transgressed against My law. 













###### 2 






Then they will cry to Me, My God, we [of Israel] know You! 













###### 3 






Israel has rejected the good [with loathing]; the enemy shall pursue him. 













###### 4 






They set up kings, but not from Me [therefore without My blessing]; they have made princes or removed them [without consulting Me; therefore], I knew _and_ recognized [them] not. With their silver and their gold they made idols for themselves, that they [the silver and the gold] may be destroyed. 













###### 5 






Your calf [idol], O Samaria, is loathsome _and_ I have spurned it. My wrath burns against them. How long will it be before they attain purity? 













###### 6 






For this [calf] too is from Israel; a craftsman made it; therefore it is not God. The calf of Samaria shall be broken to shivers _and_ go up in flames. 













###### 7 






For they sow the wind and they shall reap the whirlwind. The standing grain has no heads; it shall yield no meal; if it were to yield, strangers _and_ aliens would eat it up. 













###### 8 






Israel is [as if] swallowed up. Already they have become among the nations as a vessel [of cheap, coarse pottery] that is useless. 













###### 9 






For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass taking her own way by herself; Ephraim has hired lovers. 













###### 10 






Yes, though with presents they hire [allies] among the nations, now will I gather them up, and in a little while they will sorrow _and_ begin to diminish [their gifts] because of the burden (tribute) imposed by the king of princes [the king of Assyria]. 













###### 11 






For Ephraim has multiplied altars for sinning; yes, to him altars are intended for sinning. 













###### 12 






I wrote for him the ten thousand things of My law, but they are counted as a strange thing [as something which does not concern him]. 













###### 13 






My sacrificial gifts they sacrifice [as a mere form]; yes, they sacrifice flesh and eat it, but the Lord does not accept them. Now He will [earnestly] remember their guilt _and_ iniquity and will punish their sins. They shall return to [another] Egypt [Assyria]. 













###### 14 






For Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces _and_ idol temples, and Judah has multiplied fortified cities; but I will send a fire upon his cities and it shall devour his palaces _and_ fortified buildings. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

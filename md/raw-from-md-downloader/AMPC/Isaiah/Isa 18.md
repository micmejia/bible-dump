# Isaiah 18

***














###### 1 






Woe to the land whirring with wings which is beyond the rivers of Cush _or_ Ethiopia, 













###### 2 






That sends ambassadors by the Nile, even in vessels of papyrus upon the waters! Go, you swift messengers, to a nation tall and polished, to a people terrible from their beginning [feared and dreaded near and far], a nation strong and victorious, whose land the rivers divide! 













###### 3 






All you inhabitants of the world, you who dwell on the earth, when a signal is raised on the mountains--look! When a trumpet is blown--hear! 













###### 4 






For thus the Lord has said to me: I will be still and I will look on from My dwelling place, like clear _and_ glowing heat in sunshine, like a fine cloud of mist in the heat of harvest. 













###### 5 






For before the harvest, when the blossom is over and the flower becomes a ripening grape, He will cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks, and the spreading branches He will remove and cut away. 













###### 6 






They [the dead bodies of the slain warriors] shall be left together to the ravenous birds of the mountains and to the beasts of the earth; and the ravenous birds will summer upon them, and all the beasts of the earth will winter upon them. 













###### 7 






At that time shall a present be brought to the Lord of hosts from a people tall and polished, from a people terrible from their beginning _and_ feared _and_ dreaded near and far, a nation strong and victorious, whose land the rivers _or_ great channels divide--to the place [of worship] of the [^a]Name of the Lord of hosts, to Mount Zion [in Jerusalem]. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

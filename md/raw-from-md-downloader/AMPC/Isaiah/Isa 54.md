# Isaiah 54

***














###### 1 






[^a]Sing, O barren one, you who did not bear; break forth into singing and cry aloud, you who did not travail with child! For the [spiritual] children of the desolate one will be more than the children of the married wife, says the Lord. 













###### 2 






Enlarge the place of your tent, and let the curtains of your habitations be stretched out; spare not; lengthen your cords and strengthen your stakes, 













###### 3 






For you will spread abroad to the right hand and to the left; and your offspring will possess the nations and make the desolate cities to be inhabited. 













###### 4 






Fear not, for you shall not be ashamed; neither be confounded _and_ depressed, for you shall not be put to shame. For you shall forget the shame of your youth, and you shall not [seriously] remember the reproach of your widowhood any more. 













###### 5 






For your Maker is your Husband--the Lord of hosts is His name--and the Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer; the God of the whole earth He is called. 













###### 6 






For the Lord has called you like a woman forsaken, grieved in spirit, _and_ heartsore--even a wife [wooed and won] in youth, when she is [later] refused _and_ scorned, says your God. 













###### 7 






For a brief moment I forsook you, but with great compassion _and_ mercy I will gather you [to Me] again. 













###### 8 






In a little burst of wrath I hid My face from you for a moment, but with age-enduring love _and_ kindness I will have compassion _and_ mercy on you, says the Lord, your Redeemer. 













###### 9 






For this is like the days of Noah to Me; as I swore that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth, so have I sworn that I will not be angry with you or rebuke you. 













###### 10 






For though the mountains should depart and the hills be shaken _or_ removed, yet My love _and_ kindness shall not depart from you, nor shall My covenant of peace _and_ completeness be removed, says the Lord, Who has compassion on you. 













###### 11 






O you afflicted [city], storm-tossed and not comforted, behold, I will set your stones in fair colors [in antimony to enhance their brilliance] and lay your foundations with sapphires. 













###### 12 






And I will make your windows _and_ pinnacles of [sparkling] agates _or_ rubies, and your gates of [shining] carbuncles, and all your walls [of your enclosures] of precious stones. 













###### 13 






And all your [spiritual] children shall be disciples [taught by the Lord and obedient to His will], and great shall be the peace _and_ undisturbed composure of your children. 













###### 14 






You shall establish yourself in righteousness (rightness, in conformity with God's will and order): you shall be far from even the thought of oppression _or_ destruction, for you shall not fear, and from terror, for it shall not come near you. 













###### 15 






Behold, they may gather together _and_ stir up strife, but it is not from Me. Whoever stirs up strife against you shall fall _and_ surrender to you. 













###### 16 






Behold, I have created the smith who blows on the fire of coals and who produces a weapon for its purpose; and I have created the devastator to destroy. 













###### 17 






But no weapon that is formed against you shall prosper, and every tongue that shall rise against you in judgment you shall show to be in the wrong. This [peace, righteousness, security, triumph over opposition] is the heritage of the servants of the Lord [those in whom the ideal Servant of the Lord is reproduced]; this is the righteousness _or_ the vindication which they obtain from Me [this is that which I impart to them as their justification], says the Lord. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

It has all the glorious confidence and assurance, the incentive and understanding, for which feminine hearts have longed throughout the ages! Every woman who will read it every week for a year with receptive heart and mind will find herself not only spiritually prepared for her own childlessness or widowhood, should it come, but also supplied with rich treasure with which to address the similar needs of countless other aching hearts to whom the Holy Spirit is here speaking.

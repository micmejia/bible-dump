# James 2

***














###### 1 






My brethren, pay no servile regard to people [show no prejudice, no partiality]. Do not [attempt to] hold _and_ practice the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ [the Lord] of glory [together with snobbery]! 













###### 2 






For if a person comes into your congregation whose hands are adorned with gold rings and who is wearing splendid apparel, and also a poor [man] in shabby clothes comes in, 













###### 3 






And you pay special attention to the one who wears the splendid clothes and say to him, Sit here in this preferable seat! while you tell the poor [man], Stand there! or, Sit there on the floor at my feet! 













###### 4 






Are you not discriminating among your own and becoming critics _and_ judges with wrong motives? 













###### 5 






Listen, my beloved brethren: Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith _and_ in their position as believers and to inherit the kingdom which He has promised to those who love Him? 













###### 6 






But you [in contrast] have insulted (humiliated, dishonored, and shown your contempt for) the poor. Is it not the rich who domineer over you? Is it not they who drag you into the law courts? 













###### 7 






Is it not they who slander _and_ blaspheme that precious name by which you are distinguished _and_ called [the name of Christ invoked in baptism]? 













###### 8 






If indeed you [really] fulfill the royal Law in accordance with the Scripture, You shall love your neighbor as [you love] yourself, you do well. 













###### 9 






But if you show servile regard (prejudice, favoritism) for people, you commit sin and are rebuked _and_ convicted by the Law as violators _and_ offenders. 













###### 10 






For whosoever keeps the Law [as a] whole but stumbles _and_ offends in one [single instance] has become guilty of [breaking] all of it. 













###### 11 






For He Who said, You shall not commit adultery, also said, You shall not kill. If you do not commit adultery but do kill, you have become guilty of transgressing the [whole] Law. 













###### 12 






So speak and so act as [people should] who are to be judged under the law of liberty [the moral instruction given by Christ, especially about love]. 













###### 13 






For to him who has shown no mercy the judgment [will be] merciless, but mercy [full of glad confidence] exults victoriously over judgment. 













###### 14 






What is the use (profit), my brethren, for anyone to profess to have faith if he has no [good] works [to show for it]? Can [such] faith save [his soul]? 













###### 15 






If a brother or sister is poorly clad and lacks food for each day, 













###### 16 






And one of you says to him, Good-bye! Keep [yourself] warm and well fed, without giving him the necessities for the body, what good does that do? 













###### 17 






So also faith, if it does not have works (deeds and actions of obedience to back it up), by itself is destitute of power (inoperative, dead). 













###### 18 






But someone will say [to you then], You [say you] have faith, and I have [good] works. Now you show me your [alleged] faith apart from any [good] works [if you can], and I by [good] works [of obedience] will show you my faith. 













###### 19 






You believe that God is one; you do well. So do the demons believe and shudder [in terror and horror such as [^a]make a man's hair stand on end and contract the surface of his skin]! 













###### 20 






Are you willing to be shown [proof], you foolish (unproductive, spiritually deficient) fellow, that faith apart from [good] works is inactive _and_ ineffective _and_ worthless? 













###### 21 






Was not our forefather Abraham [shown to be] justified (made acceptable to God) by [his] works when he brought to the altar as an offering his [own] son Isaac? 













###### 22 






You see that [his] faith was cooperating with his works, and [his] faith was completed _and_ reached its supreme expression [when he implemented it] by [good] works. 













###### 23 






And [so] the Scripture was fulfilled that says, Abraham believed in (adhered to, trusted in, and relied on) God, and this was accounted to him as righteousness (as conformity to God's will in thought and deed), and he was called God's friend. 













###### 24 






You see that a man is justified (pronounced righteous before God) through what he does and not alone through faith [through works of obedience as well as by what he believes]. 













###### 25 






So also with Rahab the harlot--was she not shown to be justified (pronounced righteous before God) by [good] deeds when she took in the scouts (spies) and sent them away by a different route? 













###### 26 






For as the human body apart from the spirit is lifeless, so faith apart from [its] works of obedience is also dead. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

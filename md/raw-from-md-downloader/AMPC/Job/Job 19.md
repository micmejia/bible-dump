# Job 19

***














###### 1 






Then Job answered: 













###### 2 






How long will you vex _and_ torment me and break me in pieces with words? 













###### 3 






These ten times you have reproached me; you are not ashamed that you make yourselves strange [harden yourselves against me and deal severely with me]. 













###### 4 






And if it were true that I have erred, my error would remain with me [I would be conscious of it]. 













###### 5 






If indeed you magnify yourselves against me and plead against me my reproach _and_ humiliation, 













###### 6 






Know that God has overthrown _and_ put me in the wrong and has closed His net about me. 













###### 7 






Behold, I cry out, Violence! but I am not heard; I cry aloud for help, but there is no justice. 













###### 8 






He has walled up my way so that I cannot pass, and He has set darkness upon my paths. 













###### 9 






He has stripped me of my glory and taken the crown from my head. 













###### 10 






He has broken me down on every side, and I am gone; my hope has He pulled up like a tree. 













###### 11 






He has also kindled His wrath against me, and He counts me as one of His adversaries. 













###### 12 






His troops come together and cast up their way _and_ siege works against me and encamp round about my tent. 













###### 13 






He has put my brethren far from me, and my acquaintances are wholly estranged from me. 













###### 14 






My kinsfolk have failed me, and my familiar friends have forgotten me. 













###### 15 






Those who live temporarily in my house and my maids count me as a stranger; I am an alien in their sight. 













###### 16 






I call to my servant, but he gives me no answer, though I beseech him with words. 













###### 17 






I am repulsive to my wife and loathsome to the children of my own mother. 













###### 18 






Even young children despise me; when I get up, they speak against me. 













###### 19 






All the men of my council _and_ my familiar friends abhor me; those whom I loved are turned against me. 













###### 20 






My bone clings to my skin and to my flesh, and I have escaped with the skin _or_ gums of my teeth. 













###### 21 






Have pity on me! Have pity on me, O you my friends, for the hand of God has touched me! 













###### 22 






Why do you, as if you were God, pursue _and_ persecute me? [Acting like wild beasts] why are you not satisfied with my flesh? 













###### 23 






Oh, that the words I now speak were written! Oh, that they were inscribed in a book [carved on a tablet of stone]! 













###### 24 






That with an iron pen and [molten] lead they were graven in the rock forever! 













###### 25 






For I know that my Redeemer _and_ Vindicator lives, and at last He [the Last One] will stand upon the earth. 













###### 26 






And after my skin, even this body, has been destroyed, then from my flesh _or_ without it I shall see God, 













###### 27 






Whom I, even I, shall see for myself _and_ on my side! And my eyes shall behold Him, and not as a stranger! My heart pines away _and_ is consumed within me. 













###### 28 






If you say, How we will pursue him! [and continue to persecute me with the claim] that the root [cause] of all these [afflictions] is found in me, 













###### 29 






Then beware _and_ be afraid of the sword [of divine vengeance], for wrathful are the punishments of that sword, that you may know there is a judgment. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Job 22

***














###### 1 






Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered [Job], 













###### 2 






Can a man be profitable to God? Surely he that is wise is profitable to himself. 













###### 3 






Is it any pleasure _or_ advantage to the Almighty that you are righteous (upright and in right standing with Him)? Or is it gain to Him that you make your ways perfect? 













###### 4 






Is it for your [reverential] fear of Him that He [thus] reproves you, that He enters with you into judgment? 













###### 5 






Is not your wickedness great? There is no end to your iniquities. 













###### 6 






For you have taken pledges of your brother for nothing, and stripped the naked of their clothing. 













###### 7 






You have not given water to the weary to drink, and you have withheld bread from the hungry. 













###### 8 






But [you, Job] the man with power possessed the land, and the favored _and_ accepted man dwelt in it. 













###### 9 






You have sent widows away empty-handed, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken. 













###### 10 






Therefore snares are round about you, and sudden fear troubles _and_ overwhelms you; 













###### 11 






Your light is darkened, so that you cannot see, and a flood of water covers you. 













###### 12 






Is not God in the height of heaven? And behold the height of the stars, how high they are! 













###### 13 






Therefore you say, How _and_ what does God know [about me]? Can He judge through the thick darkness? 













###### 14 






Thick clouds are a covering to Him, so that He does not see, and He walks on the vault of the heavens. 













###### 15 






Will you pay attention _and_ keep to the old way that wicked men trod [in Noah's time], 













###### 16 






Men who were snatched away before their time, whose foundations were poured out like a stream [during the flood]? 













###### 17 






They said to God, Depart from us, and, What can the Almighty do for _or_ to us? 













###### 18 






Yet He filled their houses with good [things]. But the counsel of the ungodly is far from me. 













###### 19 






The righteous see it and are glad; and the innocent laugh them to scorn [saying], 













###### 20 






Surely those who rose up against us are cut off, and that which remained to them the fire has consumed. 













###### 21 






Acquaint now yourself with Him [agree with God and show yourself to be conformed to His will] and be at peace; by that [you shall prosper and great] good shall come to you. 













###### 22 






Receive, I pray you, the law _and_ instruction from His mouth and lay up His words in your heart. 













###### 23 






If you return to the Almighty [and submit and humble yourself before Him], you will be built up; if you put away unrighteousness far from your tents, 













###### 24 






If you lay gold in the dust, and the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brook [considering them of little worth], 













###### 25 






And make the Almighty your gold and [the Lord] your precious silver treasure, 













###### 26 






Then you will have delight in the Almighty, and you will lift up your face to God. 













###### 27 






You will make your prayer to Him, and He will hear you, and you will pay your vows. 













###### 28 






You shall also decide _and_ decree a thing, and it shall be established for you; and the light [of God's favor] shall shine upon your ways. 













###### 29 






When they make [you] low, you will say, [There is] a lifting up; and the humble person He lifts up _and_ saves. 













###### 30 






He will even deliver the one [for whom you intercede] who is not innocent; yes, he will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

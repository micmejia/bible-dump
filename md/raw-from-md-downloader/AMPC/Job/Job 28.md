# Job 28

***














###### 1 






Surely there is a mine for silver, and a place for gold where they refine it. 













###### 2 






Iron is taken out of the earth, and copper is smelted from the stone ore. 













###### 3 






Man sets an end to darkness, and he searches out the farthest bounds for the ore buried in gloom and deep darkness. 













###### 4 






Men break open shafts away from where people sojourn, in places forgotten by [human] foot; and [descend into them], hanging afar from men, they swing _or_ flit to and fro. 













###### 5 






As for the earth, out of it comes bread, but underneath [its surface, down deep in the mine] there is [^a]blasting, turning it up as by fire. 













###### 6 






Its stones are the bed of sapphires; it holds dust of gold [which he wins]. 













###### 7 






That path no bird of prey knows, and the falcon's eye has not seen it. 













###### 8 






The proud beasts [and their young] have not trodden it, nor has the fierce lion passed over it. 













###### 9 






Man puts forth his hand upon the flinty rock; he overturns the mountains by the roots. 













###### 10 






He cuts out channels _and_ passages among the rocks; and his eye sees every precious thing. 













###### 11 






[Man] binds the streams so that they do not trickle [into the mine], and the thing that is hidden he brings forth to light. 













###### 12 






But where shall [^b]Wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding? 













###### 13 






Man knows not the price of it; neither is it found in the land of the living. 













###### 14 






The deep says, [Wisdom] is not in me; and the sea says, It is not with me. 













###### 15 






It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price of it. 













###### 16 






It cannot be valued in [terms of] the gold of Ophir, in the precious onyx _or_ beryl, or the sapphire. 













###### 17 






Gold and glass cannot equal [Wisdom], nor can it be exchanged for jewels _or_ vessels of fine gold. 













###### 18 






No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal; for the possession of Wisdom is even above rubies _or_ pearls. 













###### 19 






The topaz of Ethiopia cannot compare with it, nor can it be valued in pure gold. 













###### 20 






From where then does Wisdom come? And where is the place of understanding? 













###### 21 






It is hidden from the eyes of all living, and knowledge of it is withheld from the birds of the heavens. 













###### 22 






Abaddon (the place of destruction) and Death say, We have [only] heard the report of it with our ears. 













###### 23 






God understands the way [to Wisdom] and He knows the place of it [Wisdom is with God alone]. 













###### 24 






For He looks to the ends of the earth and sees everything under the heavens. 













###### 25 






When He gave to the wind weight _or_ pressure and allotted the waters by measure, 













###### 26 






When He made a decree for the rain and a way for the lightning of the thunder, 













###### 27 






Then He saw [Wisdom] and declared it; He established it, yes, and searched it out [for His own use, and He alone possesses it]. 













###### 28 






But to man He said, Behold, the reverential _and_ worshipful fear of the Lord--that is Wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

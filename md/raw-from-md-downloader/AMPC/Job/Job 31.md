# Job 31

***














###### 1 






I dictated a covenant (an agreement) to my eyes; how then could I look [lustfully] upon a girl? 













###### 2 






For what portion should I have from God above [if I were lewd], and what heritage from the Almighty on high? 













###### 3 






Does not calamity [justly] befall the unrighteous, and disaster the workers of iniquity? 













###### 4 






Does not [God] see my ways and count all my steps? 













###### 5 






If I have walked with falsehood _or_ vanity, or if my foot has hastened to deceit-- 













###### 6 






Oh, let me be weighed in a just balance _and_ let Him weigh me, that God may know my integrity! 













###### 7 






If my step has turned out of [God's] way, and my heart has gone the way my eyes [covetously] invited, and if any spot has stained my hands with guilt, 













###### 8 






Then let me sow and let another eat; yes, let the produce of my field _or_ my offspring be rooted out. 













###### 9 






If my heart has been deceived _and_ I made a fool by a woman, or if I have [covetously] laid wait at my neighbor's door [until his departure], 













###### 10 






Then let my wife grind [meal, like a bondslave] for another, and let others bow down upon her. 













###### 11 






For [adultery] is a heinous _and_ chief crime, an iniquity [to demand action by] the judges _and_ punishment. 













###### 12 






For [uncontrolled passion] is a fire which consumes to Abaddon (to destruction, ruin, and the place of final torment); [that fire once lighted would rage until all is consumed] and would burn to the root all my [life's] increase. 













###### 13 






If I have despised _and_ rejected the cause of my manservant or my maidservant when they contended _or_ brought a complaint against me, 













###### 14 






What then shall I do when God rises up [to judge]? When He visits [to inquire of me], what shall I answer Him? 













###### 15 






Did not He Who made me in the womb make [my servant]? And did not One fashion us both in the womb? 













###### 16 






If I have withheld from the poor _and_ needy what they desired, or have caused the eyes of the widow to look in vain [for relief], 













###### 17 






Or have eaten my morsel alone and have not shared it with the fatherless-- 













###### 18 






No, but from my youth [the fatherless] grew up with me as a father, and I have been [the widow's] guide from my mother's womb-- 













###### 19 






If I have seen anyone perish for want of clothing, or any poor person without covering, 













###### 20 






If his loins have not blessed me [for clothing them], and if he was not warmed with the fleece of my sheep, 













###### 21 






If I have lifted my hand against the fatherless when I saw [that the judges would be favorable and be] my help at the [council] gate, 













###### 22 






Then let my shoulder fall away from my shoulder blade, and my arm be broken from its socket. 













###### 23 






For calamity from God was a terror to me, and because of His majesty I could not endure [to face Him] _and_ could do nothing. 













###### 24 






If I have made gold my trust _and_ hope or have said to fine gold, You are my confidence, 













###### 25 






If I rejoiced because my wealth was great and because my [powerful] hand [alone] had gotten much, 













###### 26 






If I beheld [as an object of worship] the sunlight when it shone or the moon walking in its brightness, 













###### 27 






And my heart has been secretly enticed by them or my mouth has kissed my hand [in homage to them], 













###### 28 






This also would have been [a heinous and principal] iniquity to demand the judges' action _and_ punishment, for I would have denied _and_ been false to the God Who is above. 













###### 29 






If I rejoiced at the destruction of him who hated me or lifted myself up [in malicious triumph] when evil overtook him-- 













###### 30 






No, I have let my mouth sin neither by cursing my enemy nor by praying that he might die-- 













###### 31 






[Just ask] if the men of my tent will not say, Who can find one in need who has not been satisfied with food he gave them?-- 













###### 32 






The temporary resident has not lodged in the street, but I have opened my door to the wayfaring man-- 













###### 33 






If like Adam _or_ like [other] men I have concealed my transgressions, by hiding my iniquity in my bosom 













###### 34 






Because I feared the great multitude and the contempt of families terrified me so that I kept silence and did not go out of the door-- 













###### 35 






Oh, for a hearing! Oh, for an answer from the Almighty! Let my adversary write out His indictment [and put His vague accusations in tangible form] in a book! 













###### 36 






Surely I would [proudly] bear it on my shoulder and wind the scroll about my head as a diadem. 













###### 37 






I would count out to Him the number of my steps [with every detail of my life], approaching His presence as a prince-- 













###### 38 






For if my land has cried out against me and its furrows have complained together with tears [that I have no right to them], 













###### 39 






If I have eaten its fruits without paying for them or have caused its [rightful] owners to breathe their last, 













###### 40 






Let thistles grow instead of wheat and cockleburs instead of barley. The [controversial] words of Job [with his friends] are ended. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Jonah 2

***














###### 1 






Then Jonah prayed to the Lord his God from the fish's belly, 













###### 2 






And said, I cried out of my distress to the Lord, and He heard me; out of the belly of Sheol cried I, and You heard my voice. 













###### 3 






For You cast me into the deep, into the heart of the seas, and the floods surrounded me; all Your waves and Your billows passed over me. 













###### 4 






Then I said, I have been cast out of Your presence _and_ Your sight; yet I will look again toward Your holy temple. 













###### 5 






The waters compassed me about, even to [the extinction of] life; the abyss surrounded me, the seaweed was wrapped about my head. 













###### 6 






I went down to the bottoms _and_ the very roots of the mountains; the earth with its bars closed behind me forever. Yet You have brought up my life from the pit _and_ corruption, O Lord my God. 













###### 7 






When my soul fainted upon me [crushing me], I earnestly _and_ seriously remembered the Lord; and my prayer came to You, into Your holy temple. 













###### 8 






Those who pay regard to false, useless, _and_ worthless idols forsake their own [Source of] mercy _and_ loving-kindness. 













###### 9 






But as for me, I will sacrifice to You with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that which I have vowed. Salvation _and_ deliverance belong to the Lord! 













###### 10 






And the Lord spoke to the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

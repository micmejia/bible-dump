# Leviticus 21

***














###### 1 






The Lord said to Moses, Speak to the priests [exclusive of the high priest], the sons of Aaron, and say to them that none of them shall defile himself for the dead among his people [by touching a corpse or assisting in preparing it for burial], 













###### 2 






Except for his near [blood] kin, for his mother, father, son, daughter, brother, 













###### 3 






And for his sister, a virgin, who is near to him because she has had no husband; for her he may be defiled. 













###### 4 






He shall not even defile himself, being a [bereaved] husband [his wife not being his blood kin] _or_ being a chief man among his people, and so profane himself. 













###### 5 






The priests [like the other Israelite men] shall not shave the crown of their heads or clip off the corners of their beard or make any cuttings in their flesh. 













###### 6 






They shall be holy to their God and not profane the name of their God; for they offer the offerings made by fire to the Lord, the bread of their God; therefore they shall be holy. 













###### 7 






They shall not take a wife who is a harlot or polluted _or_ profane or divorced, for [the priest] is holy to his God. 













###### 8 






You shall consecrate him therefore, for he offers the bread of your God; he shall be holy to you, for I the Lord Who sanctifies you am holy. 













###### 9 






The daughter of any priest who profanes herself by playing the harlot profanes her father; she shall be burned with fire [after being stoned]. 













###### 10 






But he who is the high priest among his brethren, upon whose head the anointing oil was poured and who is consecrated to put on the [sacred] garments, shall not let the hair of his head hang loose or rend his clothes [in mourning], 













###### 11 






Neither shall he go in where any dead body lies nor defile himself [by doing so, even] for his father or for his mother; 













###### 12 






Neither shall he go out of the sanctuary nor desecrate _or_ make ceremonially unclean the sanctuary of his God, for the crown _or_ consecration of the anointing oil of his God is upon him. I am the Lord. 













###### 13 






He shall take a wife in her virginity. 













###### 14 






A widow or a divorced woman or a woman who is polluted _or_ profane or a harlot, these he shall not marry, but he shall take as his wife a virgin of his own people, 













###### 15 






That he may not profane _or_ dishonor his children among his people; for I the Lord do sanctify the high priest. 













###### 16 






And the Lord said to Moses, 













###### 17 






Say to Aaron, Any one of your sons in their successive generations who has any blemish, let him not come near to offer the bread of his God. 













###### 18 






For no man who has a blemish shall approach [God's altar to serve as priest], a man blind or lame, or he who has a disfigured face or a limb too long, 













###### 19 






Or who has a fractured foot or hand, 













###### 20 






Or is a hunchback, or a dwarf, or has a defect in his eye, or has scurvy _or_ itch, or scabs _or_ skin trouble, or has damaged testicles. 













###### 21 






No man of the offspring of Aaron the priest who has a blemish _and_ is disfigured _or_ deformed shall come near [the altar] to offer the offerings of the Lord made by fire. He has a blemish; he shall not come near to offer the bread of his God. 













###### 22 






He may eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy and of the holy things, 













###### 23 






But he shall not come within the veil or come near the altar [of incense], because he has a blemish, that he may not desecrate _and_ make unclean My sanctuaries _and_ hallowed things; for I the Lord do sanctify them. 













###### 24 






And Moses told it to Aaron and to his sons and to all the Israelites. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Luke 1

***














###### 1 






Since [[^a]as is well known] many have undertaken to put in order _and_ draw up a [[^b]thorough] narrative of the surely established deeds which have been accomplished _and_ fulfilled [^c] in _and_ among us, 













###### 2 






Exactly as they were handed down to us by those who from the [[^d]official] beginning [of Jesus' ministry] were eyewitnesses and ministers of the Word [that is, of [^e]the doctrine concerning the attainment through Christ of salvation in the kingdom of God], 













###### 3 






It seemed good _and_ desirable to me, [and so I have determined] also after [^f]having searched out diligently _and_ followed all things closely _and_ traced accurately the course from the highest to the minutest detail from the very first, to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, 













###### 4 






[My purpose is] that you may know the full truth _and_ understand with certainty _and_ security against error the accounts (histories) _and_ doctrines of the faith of which you have been informed _and_ in which you have been [^g]orally instructed. 













###### 5 






In the days when Herod was king of Judea there was a certain priest whose name was Zachariah, [^h]of the daily service (the division) of Abia; and his wife was also a descendant of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth. 













###### 6 






And they both were righteous in the sight of God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and requirements of the Lord. 













###### 7 






But they had no child, for Elizabeth was barren; and both were [^i]far advanced in years. 













###### 8 






Now while on duty, serving as priest before God in the order of his division, 













###### 9 






As was the custom of the priesthood, it fell to him by lot to enter [the [^j]sanctuary of] the temple of the Lord and burn incense. 













###### 10 






And all the throng of people were praying outside [in the court] at the hour of incense [burning]. 













###### 11 






And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord, standing at the right side of the altar of incense. 













###### 12 






And when Zachariah saw him, he was troubled, and fear took possession of him. 













###### 13 






But the angel said to him, Do not be afraid, Zachariah, because your petition [^k]was heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you must call his name John [God is favorable]. 













###### 14 






And you shall have joy and exultant delight, and many will rejoice over his birth, 













###### 15 






For he will be great _and_ distinguished in the sight of the Lord. And he must drink no wine nor strong drink, and he will be filled with _and_ controlled by the Holy Spirit even [^l]in _and_ from his mother's womb. 













###### 16 






And he will turn back _and_ cause to return many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God, 













###### 17 






And he will [himself] go before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn back the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient _and_ incredulous _and_ unpersuadable to the wisdom of the upright [which is [^m]the knowledge and holy love of the will of God]--in order to make ready for the Lord a people [perfectly] prepared [in spirit, [^n]adjusted and disposed and placed in the right moral state]. 













###### 18 






And Zachariah said to the angel, By what shall I know _and_ be sure of this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years. 













###### 19 






And the angel replied to him, I am Gabriel. I stand in the [very] presence of God, and I have been sent to talk to you and to bring you this good news. 













###### 20 






Now behold, you will be _and_ [^o]will continue to be silent and not able to speak till the day when these things take place, because you have not believed what I told you; but my words are [^p]of a kind which will be fulfilled in the appointed _and_ proper time. 













###### 21 






Now the people kept waiting for Zachariah, and they wondered at his delaying [so long] in the [^q]sanctuary. 













###### 22 






But when he did come out, he was unable to speak to them; and they [[^r]clearly] perceived that he had seen a vision in the [^s]sanctuary; and he kept making signs to them, still he remained dumb. 













###### 23 






And when his time of performing priestly functions was ended, he returned to his [own] house. 













###### 24 






Now after this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant, and for five months she secluded herself [^t]entirely, saying, [I have hid myself] 













###### 25 






[^u]Because thus the Lord has dealt with me in the days when He deigned to look on me to take away my reproach among men. 













###### 26 






Now in the sixth month [after that], the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town of Galilee named Nazareth, 













###### 27 






To a girl never having been married _and_ a [^v]virgin engaged to be married to a man whose name was Joseph, a descendant of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary. 













###### 28 






And he came to her and said, Hail, O favored one [[^w]endued with grace]! The Lord is with you! [^x]_Blessed (favored of God) are you before all other women!_ 













###### 29 






But _when she saw him_, she was greatly troubled _and_ disturbed _and_ confused at what he said and kept revolving in her mind what such a greeting might mean. 













###### 30 






And the angel said to her, Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found grace ([^y]free, spontaneous, absolute favor and loving-kindness) with God. 













###### 31 






And listen! You will become pregnant and will give birth to a Son, and you shall call His name Jesus. 













###### 32 






He will be great (eminent) and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give to Him the throne of His forefather David, 













###### 33 






And He will reign over the house of Jacob throughout the ages; and of His reign there will be no end. 













###### 34 






And Mary said to the angel, How can this be, since I have no [intimacy with any man as a] husband? 













###### 35 






Then the angel said to her, The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you [like a shining cloud]; and so the holy (pure, sinless) Thing (Offspring) which shall be born _of you_ will be called the Son of God. 













###### 36 






And listen! Your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son, and this is now the sixth month with her who was called barren. 













###### 37 






For with God nothing is ever impossible _and_ no word from God shall be without power _or_ impossible of fulfillment. 













###### 38 






Then Mary said, Behold, I am the handmaiden of the Lord; let it be done to me according to what you have said. And the angel left her. 













###### 39 






And at that time Mary arose and went with haste into the hill country to a town of Judah, 













###### 40 






And she went to the house of Zachariah and, entering it, saluted Elizabeth. 













###### 41 






And it occurred that when Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with _and_ controlled by the Holy Spirit. 













###### 42 






And she cried out with a loud cry, and then exclaimed, Blessed (favored of God) above all other women are you! And blessed (favored of God) is the Fruit of your womb! 













###### 43 






And how [have I deserved that this honor should] be granted to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? 













###### 44 






For behold, the instant the sound of your salutation reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy. 













###### 45 






And blessed (happy, [^z]to be envied) is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of the things that were spoken to her from the Lord. 













###### 46 






And Mary said, My soul magnifies _and_ extols the Lord, 













###### 47 






And my spirit rejoices in God my Savior, 













###### 48 






For He has looked upon the low station _and_ humiliation of His handmaiden. For behold, from now on all generations [of all ages] will call me blessed _and_ declare me happy _and_ [^aa]to be envied! 













###### 49 






For He Who is almighty has done great things for me--and holy is His name [to be venerated in His purity, majesty and glory]! 













###### 50 






And His mercy (His compassion and kindness toward the miserable and afflicted) is on those who fear Him with godly reverence, from generation to generation _and_ age to age. 













###### 51 






He has shown strength _and_ [^ab]made might with His arm; He has scattered the proud _and_ haughty in _and_ by the imagination _and_ purpose _and_ designs of their hearts. 













###### 52 






He has put down the mighty from their thrones and exalted those of low degree. 













###### 53 






He has filled _and_ satisfied the hungry with good things, and the rich He has sent away empty-handed [without a gift]. 













###### 54 






He has laid hold on His servant Israel [to help him, to espouse his cause], in remembrance of His mercy, 













###### 55 






Even as He promised to our forefathers, to Abraham and to his descendants forever. 













###### 56 






And Mary remained with her [Elizabeth] for about three months and [then] returned to her [own] home. 













###### 57 






Now the time that Elizabeth should be delivered came, and she gave birth to a son. 













###### 58 






And her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great mercy on her, and they rejoiced with her. 













###### 59 






And it occurred that on the eighth day, when they came to circumcise the child, they were intending to call him Zachariah after his father, 













###### 60 






But his mother answered, Not so! But he shall be called John. 













###### 61 






And they said to her, None of your relatives is called by that name. 













###### 62 






And they inquired with signs to his father [as to] what he wanted to have him called. 













###### 63 






Then Zachariah asked for a writing tablet and wrote, His name is John. And they were all astonished. 













###### 64 






And at once his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he began to speak, blessing _and_ praising _and_ thanking God. 













###### 65 






And awe _and_ reverential fear came on all their neighbors; and all these things were discussed throughout the hill country of Judea. 













###### 66 






And all who heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, Whatever will this little boy be then? For the hand of the Lord was [[^ac]so evidently] with him [protecting and aiding him]. 













###### 67 






Now Zachariah his father was filled with _and_ controlled by the Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying, 













###### 68 






Blessed (praised and extolled and thanked) be the Lord, the God of Israel, because He has come and brought deliverance _and_ redemption to His people! 













###### 69 






And He has raised up a Horn of salvation [a mighty and valiant Helper, the Author of salvation] for us in the house of David His servant-- 













###### 70 






This is as He promised by the mouth of His holy prophets from the most ancient times [in the memory of man]-- 













###### 71 






That we should have deliverance _and_ be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all who detest _and_ pursue us with hatred; 













###### 72 






To make true _and_ show the mercy _and_ compassion _and_ kindness [promised] to our forefathers and to remember _and_ carry out His holy covenant [to bless, which is [^ad]all the more sacred because it is made by God Himself], 













###### 73 






That covenant He sealed by oath to our forefather Abraham: 













###### 74 






To grant us that we, being delivered from the hand of our foes, might serve Him fearlessly 













###### 75 






In holiness (divine consecration) and righteousness [in accordance with the everlasting principles of right] within His presence all the days of our lives. 













###### 76 






And you, little one, shall be called a prophet of the Most High; for you shall go on before the face of the Lord to make ready His ways, 













###### 77 






To bring _and_ give the knowledge of salvation to His people in the forgiveness _and_ remission of their sins. 













###### 78 






Because of _and_ through the heart of tender mercy _and_ loving-kindness of our God, a Light from on high will dawn upon us _and_ visit [us] 













###### 79 






To shine upon _and_ give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to direct _and_ guide our feet in a straight line into the way of peace. 













###### 80 






And the little boy grew and became strong in spirit; and he was in the deserts (wilderness) until the day of his appearing to Israel [the commencement of his public ministry]. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

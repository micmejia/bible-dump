# Luke 3

***














###### 1 






In the fifteenth year of Tiberius Caesar's reign--when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod was tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene-- 













###### 2 






In the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the Word of God [[^a]concerning the attainment through Christ of salvation in the kingdom of God] came to John son of Zachariah in the wilderness (desert). 













###### 3 






And he went into all the country round about the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance ([^b]of hearty amending of their ways, with abhorrence of past wrongdoing) unto the forgiveness of sin. 













###### 4 






As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, The voice of one crying in the wilderness [shouting in the desert]: Prepare the way of the Lord, make His beaten paths straight. 













###### 5 






Every valley _and_ ravine shall be filled up, and every mountain and hill shall be leveled; and the crooked places shall be made straight, and the rough roads shall be made smooth; 













###### 6 






And all mankind shall see (behold and [^c]understand and at last acknowledge) the salvation of God (the deliverance from eternal death [^d]decreed by God). 













###### 7 






So he said to the crowds who came out to be baptized by him, You offspring of vipers! Who [^e]secretly warned you to flee from the coming wrath? 













###### 8 






Bear fruits that are deserving _and_ consistent with [your] repentance [that is, [^f]conduct worthy of a heart changed, a heart abhorring sin]. And do not begin to say to yourselves, We have Abraham as our father; for I tell you that God is able from these stones to raise up descendants for Abraham. 













###### 9 






Even now the ax is laid to the root of the trees, so that every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire. 













###### 10 






And the multitudes asked him, Then what shall we do? 













###### 11 






And he replied to them, He who has two tunics (undergarments), let him share with him who has none; and he who has food, let him do it the same way. 













###### 12 






Even tax collectors came to be baptized, and they said to him, Teacher, what shall we do? 













###### 13 






And he said to them, Exact _and_ collect no more than the fixed amount appointed you. 













###### 14 






Those serving as soldiers also asked him, And we, what shall we do? And he replied to them, Never demand _or_ enforce [^g]by terrifying people or by accusing wrongfully, and always be satisfied with your rations (supplies) _and_ with your allowance (wages). 













###### 15 






As the people were in suspense _and_ waiting expectantly, and everybody reasoned _and_ questioned in their hearts concerning John, whether he perhaps might be the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One). 













###### 16 






John answered them all by saying, I baptize you with water; but He Who is mightier than I is coming, the strap of Whose sandals I am not fit to unfasten. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. 













###### 17 






His winnowing shovel (fork) is in His hand to thoroughly clear _and_ cleanse His [threshing] floor and to gather the wheat _and_ store it in His granary, but the chaff He will burn with fire that cannot be extinguished. 













###### 18 






So with many other [various] appeals and admonitions he preached the good news (the Gospel) to the people. 













###### 19 






But Herod the tetrarch, who had been [repeatedly] told about his fault _and_ reproved _with_ rebuke [^h]producing conviction by [John] for [having] Herodias, his brother's wife, and for all the wicked things that Herod had done, 













###### 20 






Added this to them all--that he shut up John in prison. 













###### 21 






Now when all the people were baptized, and when Jesus also had been baptized, and [while He was still] praying, the [visible] heaven was opened 













###### 22 






And the Holy Spirit descended upon Him in bodily form like a dove, and a voice came from heaven, _saying_, You are My Son, My Beloved! In You I am well pleased _and_ find delight! 













###### 23

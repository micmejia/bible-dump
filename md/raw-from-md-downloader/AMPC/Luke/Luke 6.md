# Luke 6

***














###### 1 






One Sabbath while Jesus was passing through the fields of standing grain, it occurred that His disciples picked some of the spikes and ate [of the grain], rubbing it out in their hands. 













###### 2 






But some of the Pharisees asked them, Why are you doing what is not permitted to be done on the Sabbath days? 













###### 3 






And Jesus replied to them, saying, Have you never so much as read what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him?-- 













###### 4 






How he went into the house of God and took and ate the [sacred] loaves of the showbread, which it is not permitted for any except only the priests to eat, and also gave to those [who were] with him? 













###### 5 






And He said to them, The Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath. 













###### 6 






And it occurred on another Sabbath that when He went into the synagogue and taught, a man was present whose right hand was withered. 













###### 7 






And the scribes and the Pharisees kept watching Jesus to see whether He would [actually] heal on the Sabbath, in order that they might get [some ground for] accusation against Him. 













###### 8 






But He was aware all along of their thoughts, and He said to the man with the withered hand, Come and stand here in the midst. And he arose and stood there. 













###### 9 






Then Jesus said to them, I ask you, is it lawful _and_ right on the Sabbath to do good [[^a]so that someone derives advantage from it] or to do evil, to save a life [and [^b]make a soul safe] or to destroy it? 













###### 10 






Then He glanced around at them all and said to the man, Stretch out your hand! And he did so, and his hand was fully restored [^c]_like the other one_. 













###### 11 






But they were filled with lack of understanding _and_ senseless rage and discussed (consulted) with one another what they might do to Jesus. 













###### 12 






Now in those days it occurred that He went up into a mountain to pray, and spent the whole night in prayer to God. 













###### 13 






And when it was day, He summoned His disciples and selected from them twelve, whom He named apostles (special messengers): 













###### 14 






They were Simon, whom He named Peter, and his brother Andrew; and James and John; and Philip and Bartholomew; 













###### 15 






And Matthew and Thomas; and James son of Alphaeus, and Simon who was called the Zealot, 













###### 16 






And Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor (a treacherous, basely faithless person). 













###### 17 






And Jesus came down with them and took His stand on a level spot, with a great crowd of His disciples and a vast throng of people from all over Judea and Jerusalem and the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to listen to Him and to be cured of their diseases-- 













###### 18 






Even those who were disturbed _and_ troubled with unclean spirits, and they were being healed [also]. 













###### 19 






And all the multitude were seeking to touch Him, for healing power was all the while going forth from Him and curing them all [[^d]saving them from severe illnesses or calamities]. 













###### 20 






And solemnly lifting up His eyes on His disciples, He said: Blessed (happy--[^e]with life-joy and satisfaction in God's favor and salvation, apart from your outward condition--and [^f]to be envied) are you poor _and_ [^g]lowly _and_ afflicted (destitute of wealth, influence, position, and honor), for the kingdom of God is yours! 













###### 21 






Blessed (happy--[^h]with life-joy and satisfaction in God's favor and salvation, apart from your outward condition--and [^i]to be envied) are you who hunger _and_ seek with eager desire now, for you shall be filled _and_ completely satisfied! Blessed (happy--[^j]with life-joy and satisfaction in God's favor and salvation, apart from your outward condition--and [^k]to be envied) are you who weep _and_ sob now, for you shall laugh! 













###### 22 






Blessed (happy--[^l]with life-joy and satisfaction in God's favor and salvation, apart from your outward condition--and [^m]to be envied) are you when people despise (hate) you, and when they exclude _and_ excommunicate you [as disreputable] and revile _and_ denounce you and defame _and_ cast out _and_ spurn your name as evil (wicked) on account of the Son of Man. 













###### 23 






Rejoice _and_ be glad at such a time and exult _and_ leap for joy, for behold, your reward is rich _and_ great _and_ strong _and_ intense _and_ abundant in heaven; for even so their forefathers treated the prophets. 













###### 24 






But woe to (alas for) you who are rich ([^n]abounding in material resources), for you already are receiving your consolation (the solace and sense of strengthening and cheer that come from prosperity) _and_ have taken and enjoyed your comfort in full [having nothing left to be awarded you]. 













###### 25 






Woe to (alas for) you who are full now (completely filled, luxuriously gorged and satiated), for you shall hunger _and_ suffer want! Woe to (alas for) you who laugh now, for you shall mourn and weep _and_ wail! 













###### 26 






Woe to (alas for) you when everyone speaks fairly _and_ handsomely of you _and_ praises you, for even so their forefathers did to the false prophets. 













###### 27 






But I say to you who are listening now to Me: [[^o]in order to heed, make it a practice to] love your enemies, treat well (do good to, act nobly toward) those who detest you _and_ pursue you with hatred, 













###### 28 






Invoke blessings upon _and_ pray for the happiness of those who curse you, implore God's blessing (favor) upon those who abuse you [who revile, reproach, disparage, and high-handedly misuse you]. 













###### 29 






To the one who strikes you on the [^p]jaw _or_ cheek, offer the other [^q]jaw _or_ cheek also; and from him who takes away your outer garment, do not withhold your undergarment as well. 













###### 30 






Give away to everyone who begs of you [who is [^r]in want of necessities], and of him who takes away from you your goods, do not demand _or_ require them back again. 













###### 31 






And as you would like _and_ desire that men would do to you, do exactly so to them. 













###### 32 






If you [merely] love those who love you, what [^s]quality of credit _and_ thanks is that to you? For even [^t]the [very] sinners love their lovers (those who love them). 













###### 33 






And if you are kind _and_ good _and_ do favors to _and_ benefit those who are kind _and_ good _and_ do favors to _and_ benefit you, what [^u]quality of credit _and_ thanks is that to you? For even [^v]the preeminently sinful do the same. 













###### 34 






And if you lend money [^w]at interest to those from whom you hope to receive, what [^x]quality of credit _and_ thanks is that to you? Even notorious sinners lend money [^y]at interest to sinners, so as to recover as much again. 













###### 35 






But love your enemies and be kind _and_ do good [doing favors [^z]so that someone derives benefit from them] and lend, expecting _and_ hoping for nothing in return _but_ [^aa]considering nothing as lost _and_ despairing of no one; and then your recompense (your reward) will be great (rich, strong, intense, and abundant), and you will be sons of the Most High, for He is kind _and_ charitable _and_ good to the ungrateful _and_ the selfish and wicked. 













###### 36 






So be merciful (sympathetic, tender, responsive, and compassionate) even as your Father is [all these]. 













###### 37 






Judge not [neither pronouncing judgment nor subjecting to censure], and you will not be judged; do not condemn _and_ pronounce guilty, and you will not be condemned _and_ pronounced guilty; acquit _and_ forgive _and_ [^ab]release (give up resentment, let it drop), and you will be acquitted _and_ forgiven _and_ [^ac]released. 













###### 38 






Give, and [gifts] will be given to you; good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, will they pour [^ad]into [the pouch formed by] the bosom [of your robe and used as a bag]. For with the measure you deal out [with the measure you use when you confer benefits on others], it will be measured back to you. 













###### 39 






He further told them [^ae]a proverb: Can a blind [man] guide _and_ direct a blind [man]? Will they not both stumble into a ditch _or_ a [^af]hole in the ground? 













###### 40 






A pupil is not superior to his teacher, but everyone [when he is] completely trained (readjusted, restored, set to rights, and perfected) will be like his teacher. 













###### 41 






Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye but do not notice _or_ consider the beam [of timber] that is in your own eye? 













###### 42 






Or how can you say to your brother, Brother, allow me to take out the speck that is in your eye, when you yourself do not see the beam that is in your own eye? You actor (pretender, hypocrite)! First take the beam out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the speck that is in your brother's eye. 













###### 43 






For there is no good (healthy) tree that bears decayed (worthless, stale) fruit, nor on the other hand does a decayed (worthless, sickly) tree bear good fruit. 













###### 44 






For each tree is known _and_ identified by its own fruit; for figs are not gathered from thornbushes, nor is a cluster of grapes picked from a bramblebush. 













###### 45 






The upright (honorable, intrinsically good) man out of the good treasure [stored] in his heart produces what is upright (honorable and intrinsically good), and the evil man out of the evil storehouse brings forth that which is depraved (wicked and intrinsically evil); for out of the abundance (overflow) of the heart his mouth speaks. 













###### 46 






Why do you call Me, Lord, Lord, and do not [practice] what I tell you? 













###### 47 






For everyone who comes to Me and listens to My words [in order to heed their teaching] and does them, I will show you what he is like: 













###### 48 






He is like a man building a house, who dug and went down deep and laid a foundation upon the rock; and when a flood arose, the torrent broke against that house and could not shake _or_ move it, because it had been securely built _or_ [^ag]_founded on a rock_. 













###### 49 






But he who merely hears and does not practice doing My words is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation, against which the torrent burst, and immediately it collapsed _and_ fell, and the breaking _and_ ruin of that house was great. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

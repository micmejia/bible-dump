# Mark 13

***














###### 1 






And as [Jesus] was coming out of the temple [[^a]area], one of His disciples said to Him, Look, Teacher! Notice the sort _and_ quality of these stones and buildings! 













###### 2 






And Jesus replied to him, You see these great buildings? There will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be loosened _and_ torn down. 













###### 3 






And as He sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple [[^b]enclosure], Peter and James and John and Andrew asked Him privately, 













###### 4 






Tell us when is this to take place and what will be the sign when these things, all [of them], are about to be accomplished? 













###### 5 






And Jesus began to tell them, Be careful _and_ watchful that no one misleads you [about it]. 













###### 6 






Many will come in [[^c]appropriating to themselves] the name [of Messiah] which belongs to Me [[^d]basing their claims on the use of My name], saying, I am [He]! And they will mislead many. 













###### 7 






And when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not get alarmed (troubled and frightened); it is necessary [that these things] take place, but the end is not yet. 













###### 8 






For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places; there will be famines _and calamities_. This is but the beginning of the [^e]intolerable anguish _and_ suffering [only the first of the [^f]birth pangs]. 













###### 9 






But look to yourselves; for they will turn you over to councils, and you will be beaten in the synagogues, and you will stand before governors and kings for My sake as a testimony to them. 













###### 10 






And the good news (the Gospel) must first be preached to all nations. 













###### 11 






Now when they take you [to court] and put you under arrest, do not be anxious beforehand about what you are to say [^g]_nor_ [_even_] _meditate about it_; but say whatever is given you in that hour _and_ at [^h]the moment, for it is not you who will be speaking, but the Holy Spirit. 













###### 12 






And brother will hand over brother to death, and the father his child; and children will take a stand against their parents and [have] them put to death. 













###### 13 






And you will be hated _and_ detested by everybody for My name's sake, but he who patiently perseveres _and_ endures to the end will be saved ([^i]made a partaker of the salvation by Christ, and delivered [^j]from spiritual death). 













###### 14 






But when you see the abomination of desolation _mentioned by Daniel the prophet_ standing where it ought not to be--[and] let the one who reads take notice _and_ consider _and_ understand _and_ heed [this]--then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. 













###### 15 






Let him who is on the housetop not go down _into the house_ nor go inside to take anything out of his house; 













###### 16 






And let him who is in the field not turn back again to get his mantle (cloak). 













###### 17 






And alas for those who are pregnant and for those who have nursing babies in those days! 













###### 18 






Pray that it may not occur in winter, 













###### 19 






For at that time there will be such affliction (oppression and tribulation) as has not been from the beginning of the creation which God created until this particular time--and [^k]positively never will be [again]. 













###### 20 






And unless the Lord had shortened the days, no human being would be saved (rescued); but for the sake of the elect, His chosen ones (those whom He [^l]picked out for Himself), He has shortened the days. 













###### 21 






And then if anyone says to you, See, here is the Christ (the Messiah)! or, Look, there He is! do not believe it. 













###### 22 






False Christs (Messiahs) and false prophets will arise and show signs and [work] miracles to deceive _and_ lead astray, if possible, even the elect (those God has chosen out for Himself). 













###### 23 






But look to yourselves _and_ be on your guard; I have told you everything beforehand. 













###### 24 






But in those days, after [the affliction and oppression and distress of] that tribulation, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; 













###### 25 






And the stars will be falling from the sky, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken. 













###### 26 






And then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great (kingly) power and glory (majesty and splendor). 













###### 27 






And then He will send out the angels and will gather together His elect (those He has [^m]picked out for Himself) from the four winds, from the farthest bounds of the earth to the farthest bounds of heaven. 













###### 28 






Now learn a lesson from the fig tree: as soon as its branch becomes tender and it puts forth its leaves, you recognize _and_ know that summer is near. 













###### 29 






So also, when you see these things happening, you may recognize _and_ know that He is near, at [the very] door. 













###### 30 






Surely I say to you, this generation ([^n]the whole multitude of people living at that one time) positively will not perish _or_ pass away before all these things take place. 













###### 31 






Heaven and earth will perish _and_ pass away, but My words will not perish _or_ pass away. 













###### 32 






But of that day or that hour not a [single] person knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. 













###### 33 






Be on your guard [constantly alert], and watch [^o]_and pray_; for you do not know when the time will come. 













###### 34 






It is like a man [[^p]already] going on a journey; when he leaves home, he puts his servants in charge, each with his particular task, and he gives orders to the doorkeeper to be constantly alert _and_ on the watch. 













###### 35 






Therefore watch (give strict attention, be cautious and alert), for you do not know when the Master of the house is coming--in the evening, or at midnight, or at cockcrowing, or in the morning-- 













###### 36 






[Watch, I say] lest He come suddenly _and_ unexpectedly and find you asleep. 













###### 37 






And what I say to you I say to everybody: Watch (give strict attention, be cautious, active, and alert)! ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

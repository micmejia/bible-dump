# Mark 15

***














###### 1 






And immediately when it was morning, the chief priests, with the elders and scribes and the whole council, held a consultation; and when they had bound Jesus, they took Him away [[^a]violently] and handed Him over to Pilate. 













###### 2 






And Pilate inquired of Him, Are You the King of the Jews? And He replied, It is as you say. 













###### 3 






And the chief priests kept accusing Him of many things. 













###### 4 






And Pilate again asked Him, Have [^b]You no answer to make? See how many charges they are bringing against You! 













###### 5 






But Jesus made no further answer at all, so that Pilate wondered _and_ marveled. 













###### 6 






Now at the Feast he [was accustomed to] set free for them any one prisoner whom they requested. 













###### 7 






And among the rioters in the prison who had committed murder in the insurrection there was a man named Barabbas. 













###### 8 






And the throng came up and began asking Pilate to do as he usually did for them. 













###### 9 






And he replied to them, Do you wish me to set free for you the King of the Jews? 













###### 10 






For he was aware that it was [[^c]because they were prompted] by envy that the chief priests had delivered Him up. 













###### 11 






But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to get him to release for them Barabbas instead. 













###### 12 






And again Pilate said to them, Then what shall I do with the Man Whom you call the King of the Jews? 













###### 13 






And they shouted back again, Crucify Him! 













###### 14 






But Pilate said to them, Why? What has He done that is evil? But they shouted with all their might all the more, Crucify Him [[^d]at once]! 













###### 15 






So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, set Barabbas free for them; and after having Jesus whipped, he handed [Him] over to be crucified. 













###### 16 






Then the soldiers led Him away to the courtyard inside the palace, that is, the Praetorium, and they called the entire detachment of soldiers together. 













###### 17 






And they dressed Him in [a] purple [robe], and, weaving together a crown of thorns, they placed it on Him. 













###### 18 






And they began to salute Him, Hail (greetings, good health to You, long life to You), King of the Jews! 













###### 19 






And they struck His head with a staff made of a [bamboo-like] reed and spat on Him and kept bowing their knees in homage to Him. 













###### 20 






And when they had [finished] making sport of Him, they took the purple [robe] off of Him and put His own clothes on Him. And they led Him out [of the city] to crucify Him. 













###### 21 






And they forced a passerby, Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, who was coming in from the field (country), to carry His cross. 













###### 22 






And they led Him to Golgotha [in Latin: Calvary], meaning The Place of a Skull. 













###### 23 






And they [attempted to] give Him wine mingled with myrrh, but He would not take it. 













###### 24 






And they crucified Him; and they divided His garments _and_ distributed them among themselves, throwing lots for them to decide who should take what. 













###### 25 






And it was the third hour (about nine o'clock in the morning) when they crucified Him. 













###### 26 






And the inscription of the accusation against Him was written above, The King of the Jews. 













###### 27 






And with Him they crucified two robbers, one on [His] right hand and one on His left. 













###### 28 






[^e]_And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, He was counted among the transgressors_. 













###### 29 






And those who passed by kept reviling Him _and_ reproaching Him abusively in harsh _and_ insolent language, wagging their heads and saying, Aha! You Who would destroy the temple and build it in three days, 













###### 30 






Now rescue [^f]Yourself [[^g]from death], coming down from the cross! 













###### 31 






So also the chief priests, with the scribes, made sport of Him to one another, saying, He rescued others [[^h]from death]; Himself He is unable to rescue. 













###### 32 






Let the Christ (the Messiah), the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see [it] and trust in _and_ rely on Him _and_ adhere to Him! Those who were crucified with Him also reviled _and_ reproached Him [speaking abusively, harshly, and insolently]. 













###### 33 






And when the sixth hour (about midday) had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour (about three o'clock). 













###### 34 






And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?--which means, My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me [[^i]deserting Me and leaving Me helpless and abandoned]? 













###### 35 






And some of those standing by, [and] hearing it, said, See! He is calling Elijah! 













###### 36 






And one man ran, and, filling a sponge with vinegar (a [^j]mixture of sour wine and water), put it on a staff made of a [bamboo-like] reed and gave it to Him to drink, saying, Hold off! Let us see whether Elijah [does] come to take Him down. 













###### 37 






And Jesus uttered a loud cry, and breathed out His life. 













###### 38 






And the curtain [of the Holy of Holies] of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. 













###### 39 






And when the centurion who stood facing Him saw Him expire this way, he said, [^k]Really, this Man was God's Son! 













###### 40 






Now some women were there also, looking on from a distance, among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome, 













###### 41 






Who, when [Jesus] was in Galilee, were in the habit of accompanying and ministering to Him; and [there were] also many other [women] who had come up with Him to Jerusalem. 













###### 42 






As evening had already come, since it was the day of Preparation, that is, [the day] before the Sabbath, 













###### 43 






Joseph, he of Arimathea, noble _and_ honorable in rank _and_ a respected member of the council (Sanhedrin), who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, daring the consequences, took courage _and_ ventured to go to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. 













###### 44 






But Pilate wondered whether He was dead so soon, and, having called the centurion, he asked him whether [Jesus] was already dead. 













###### 45 






And when he learned from the centurion [that He was indeed dead], he gave the body to Joseph. 













###### 46 






And Joseph bought a [fine] linen cloth [[^l]for swathing dead bodies], and, taking Him down from the cross, he [^m]rolled Him up in the [fine] linen cloth and placed Him in a tomb which had been hewn out of a rock. Then he rolled a [very large] stone against the door of the tomb. 













###### 47 






And Mary Magdalene and Mary [the mother] of Joses were [[^n]attentively] observing where He was laid. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

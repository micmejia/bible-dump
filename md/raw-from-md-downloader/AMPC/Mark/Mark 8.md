# Mark 8

***














###### 1 






In those days when [again] an immense crowd had gathered and they had nothing to eat, Jesus called His disciples to Him and told them, 













###### 2 






I have pity _and_ sympathy for the people _and_ My heart goes out to them, for they have been with Me now three days and have nothing [left] to eat; 













###### 3 






And if I send them away to their homes hungry, they will be feeble through exhaustion _and_ faint along the road; and some of them have come a long way. 













###### 4 






And His disciples replied to Him, How can anyone fill _and_ satisfy [these people] with loaves of bread here in [this] desolate _and_ uninhabited region? 













###### 5 






And He asked them, How many loaves have you? They said, Seven. 













###### 6 






And He commanded the multitude to recline upon the ground, and He [then] took the seven loaves [of bread] and, having given thanks, He broke them and kept on giving them to His disciples to put before [the people], and they placed them before the crowd. 













###### 7 






And they had a few small fish; and when He had [^a]praised God _and_ given thanks _and_ asked Him to bless them [to their use], He ordered that these also should be set before [them]. 













###### 8 






And they ate and were satisfied; and they took up seven [[^b]large provision] baskets full of the broken pieces left over. 













###### 9 






And there were about 4,000 people. And He dismissed them, 













###### 10 






And at once He got into the boat with His disciples and went to the district of Dalmanutha (or Magdala). 













###### 11 






The Pharisees came and began to argue with _and_ question Him, demanding from Him a sign (an attesting miracle from heaven) [maliciously] to test Him. 













###### 12 






And He groaned _and_ sighed deeply in His spirit and said, Why does this generation demand a sign? Positively I say to you, no sign shall be given this generation. 













###### 13 






And He went away _and_ left them and, getting into the boat again, He departed to the other side. 













###### 14 






Now they had [[^c]completely] forgotten to bring bread, and they had only one loaf with them in the boat. 













###### 15 






And Jesus [repeatedly and expressly] charged _and_ admonished them, saying, Look out; keep on your guard _and_ beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod [^d]_and the Herodians_. 













###### 16 






And they discussed it _and_ reasoned with one another, It is because we have no bread. 













###### 17 






And being aware [of it], Jesus said to them, Why are you reasoning _and_ saying it is because you have no bread? Do you not yet discern or understand? Are your hearts in [a settled state of] hardness? 













###### 18 






Having eyes, do you not see [with them], and having ears, do you not hear _and_ perceive _and_ understand the sense of what is said? And do you not remember? 













###### 19 






When I broke the five loaves for the 5,000, how many [[^e]small hand] baskets full of broken pieces did you take up? They said to Him, Twelve. 













###### 20 






And [when I broke] the seven loaves for the 4,000, how many [[^f]large provision] baskets full of broken pieces did you take up? And they said to Him, Seven. 













###### 21 






And He [^g]kept repeating, Do you not yet understand? 













###### 22 






And they came to Bethsaida. And [people] brought to Him a blind man and begged Him to touch him. 













###### 23 






And He [^h]caught the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village; and when He had spit on his eyes and put His hands upon him, He asked him, Do you [[^i]possibly] see anything? 













###### 24 






And he looked up and said, I see people, but [they look] like trees, walking. 













###### 25 






Then He put His hands on his eyes again; and the man looked intently [that is, fixed his eyes on definite objects], and he was restored and saw everything distinctly [even what was [^j]at a distance]. 













###### 26 






And He sent him away to his house, telling [him], Do not [even] enter the village [^k]_or tell anyone there_. 













###### 27 






And Jesus went on with His disciples to the villages of Caesarea Philippi; and on the way He asked His disciples, Who do people say that I am? 













###### 28 






And they answered [Him], John the Baptist; and others [say], Elijah; but others, one of the prophets. 













###### 29 






And He asked them, But who do you yourselves say that I am? Peter replied to Him, You are the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One). 













###### 30 






And He charged them sharply to tell no one about Him. 













###### 31 






And He began to teach them that the Son of Man must of necessity suffer many things and be tested _and_ disapproved _and_ rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and be put to death, and after three days rise again [[^l]from death]. 













###### 32 






And He said this freely (frankly, plainly, and explicitly, making it unmistakable). And Peter took Him [^m]by the hand _and_ led Him aside and then [facing Him] began to rebuke Him. 













###### 33 






But turning around [His back to Peter] and seeing His disciples, He rebuked Peter, saying, Get behind Me, Satan! For you do not have a mind [^n]intent on promoting what God wills, but what pleases men [you are not on God's side, but that of men]. 













###### 34 






And Jesus called [to Him] the throng with His disciples and said to them, If anyone intends to come after Me, let him deny himself [forget, ignore, disown, and [^o]lose sight of himself and his own interests] and take up his cross, and [[^p]joining Me as a disciple and siding with My party] follow [^q]with Me [continually, cleaving steadfastly to Me]. 













###### 35 






For whoever wants to save his [[^r]higher, spiritual, eternal] life, will lose it [the [^s]lower, natural, temporal life [^t]which is lived only on earth]; and whoever gives up his life [which is lived only on earth] for My sake and the Gospel's will save it [his [^u]higher, spiritual life [^v]in the eternal kingdom of God]. 













###### 36 






For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world, and forfeit his life [[^w]in the eternal kingdom of God]? 













###### 37 






For what can a man give as an exchange ([^x]a compensation, a ransom, in return) for his [blessed] life [[^y]in the eternal kingdom of God]? 













###### 38 






For whoever [^z]is ashamed [here and now] of Me and My words in this adulterous (unfaithful) and [preeminently] sinful generation, of him will the Son of Man also be ashamed when He comes in the glory (splendor and majesty) of His Father with the holy angels. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

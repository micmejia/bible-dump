# Matthew 7

***














###### 1 






Do not judge _and_ criticize _and_ condemn others, so that you may not be judged _and_ criticized _and_ condemned yourselves. 













###### 2 






For just as you judge _and_ criticize _and_ condemn others, you will be judged _and_ criticized _and_ condemned, and in accordance with the measure you [use to] deal out to others, it will be dealt out again to you. 













###### 3 






Why do you [^a]stare from without at the [^b]very small particle that is in your brother's eye but do not become aware of _and_ consider the beam [^c]of timber that is in your own eye? 













###### 4 






Or how can you say to your brother, Let me get the tiny particle out of your eye, when there is the beam [^d]of timber in your own eye? 













###### 5 






You hypocrite, first get the beam of timber out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the tiny particle out of your brother's eye. 













###### 6 






Do not give that which is holy (the sacred thing) to the dogs, and do not throw your pearls before hogs, lest they trample upon them with their feet and turn _and_ tear you in pieces. 













###### 7 






[^e]Keep on asking and it will be given you; [^f] keep on seeking and you will find; [^g]keep on knocking [reverently] and [the door] will be opened to you. 













###### 8 






For everyone who keeps on asking receives; and he who keeps on seeking finds; and to him who keeps on knocking, [the door] will be opened. 













###### 9 






Or what man is there of you, if his son asks him for a loaf of bread, will hand him a stone? 













###### 10 






Or if he asks for a fish, will hand him a serpent? 













###### 11 






If you then, evil as you are, know how to give good _and_ [^h]advantageous gifts to your children, how much more will your Father Who is in heaven [perfect as He is] give good _and_ [^i]advantageous things to those who [^j]keep on asking Him! 













###### 12 






So then, whatever you desire that others would do to _and_ for you, even so do also to _and_ for them, for this is (sums up) the Law and the Prophets. 













###### 13 






Enter through the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and spacious _and_ broad is the way that leads away to destruction, and many are those who are entering through it. 













###### 14 






But the gate is narrow (contracted [^k]by pressure) and the way is straitened _and_ compressed that leads away to life, and few are those who find it. 













###### 15 






Beware of false prophets, who come to you dressed as sheep, but inside they are devouring wolves. 













###### 16 






You will [^l]fully recognize them by their fruits. Do people pick grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles? 













###### 17 






Even so, every healthy (sound) tree bears good fruit [[^m]worthy of admiration], but the sickly (decaying, worthless) tree bears bad (worthless) fruit. 













###### 18 






A good (healthy) tree cannot bear bad (worthless) fruit, nor can a bad (diseased) tree bear [^n]excellent fruit [worthy of admiration]. 













###### 19 






Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire. 













###### 20 






Therefore, you will [^o]fully know them by their fruits. 













###### 21 






Not everyone who says to Me, Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father Who is in heaven. 













###### 22 






Many will say to Me on that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name and driven out demons in Your name and done many mighty works in Your name? 













###### 23 






And then I will say to them openly (publicly), I never knew you; depart from Me, you who act wickedly [disregarding My commands]. 













###### 24 






So everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts upon them [obeying them] will be like a [^p]sensible (prudent, practical, wise) man who built his house upon the rock. 













###### 25 






And the rain fell and the floods came and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock. 













###### 26 






And everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not do them will be like a stupid (foolish) man who built his house upon the sand. 













###### 27 






And the rain fell and the floods came and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell--and great _and_ complete was the fall of it. 













###### 28 






When Jesus had finished these sayings [the Sermon on the Mount], the crowds were astonished _and_ overwhelmed with bewildered wonder at His teaching, 













###### 29 






For He was teaching as _One_ Who had [and was] authority, and not as [did] the scribes. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

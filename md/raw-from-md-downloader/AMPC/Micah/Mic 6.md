# Micah 6

***














###### 1 






Hear now what the Lord says: Arise, contend _and_ plead your case before the mountains, and let the hills hear your voice. 













###### 2 






Hear, O mountains, the Lord's controversy, and you strong _and_ enduring foundations of the earth, for the Lord has a controversy (a pleading contention) with His people, and He will [pleadingly] contend with Israel. 













###### 3 






O My people, what have I done to you? And in what have I wearied you? Testify against Me [answer Me]! 













###### 4 






For I brought you up out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you out of the house where you were bond servants, and I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. 













###### 5 






O My people, [earnestly] remember now what Balak king of Moab devised and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him; [remember what the Lord did for you] from [^a]Shittim to Gilgal, that you may know the righteous _and_ saving acts of the Lord. 













###### 6 






With what shall I come before the Lord and bow myself before God on high? Shall I come before Him with burnt offerings, with calves a year old? 













###### 7 






Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? 













###### 8 






He has showed you, O man, what is good. And what does the Lord require of you but to do justly, and to love kindness _and_ mercy, and to humble yourself _and_ walk humbly with your God? 













###### 9 






The voice of the Lord calls to the city [Jerusalem]--and it is sound wisdom to hear _and_ fear Your name--Hear (heed) the rod and Him Who has appointed it. 













###### 10 






Are there not still treasures gained by wickedness in the house of the wicked, and a scant measure [a false measure for grain] that is abominable _and_ accursed? 













###### 11 






Can I be pure [Myself, and acquit the man] with wicked scales and with a bag of deceitful weights? 













###### 12 






For [the city's] rich men are full of violence; her inhabitants have spoken lies and their tongues are deceitful in their mouths. 













###### 13 






Therefore I have also smitten you with a deadly wound _and_ made you sick, laying you desolate, waste, _and_ deserted because of your sins. 













###### 14 






You shall eat but not be satisfied, and your emptiness _and_ hunger shall remain in you; you shall carry away [goods and those you love] but fail to save them, and those you do deliver I will give to the sword. 













###### 15 






You shall sow but not reap; you shall tread olives but not anoint yourselves with oil, and [you shall extract juice from] the grapes but not drink the wine. 













###### 16 






For the statutes of [idolatrous] Omri you have kept, and all the works of the house of [wicked] Ahab, and you walk in their counsels. Therefore I will make you a desolation _and_ an astonishment and your [city's] inhabitants a hissing, and you shall bear the reproach _and_ scorn of My people. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

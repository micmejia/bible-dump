# Nahum 3

***














###### 1 






Woe to the bloody city! It is full of lies and booty and [there is] no end to the plunder! 













###### 2 






The cracking of the whip, the noise of the rattling of wheels, and prancing horses and chariots rumbling _and_ bounding, 













###### 3 






Horsemen mounting _and_ charging, the flashing sword, the gleaming spear, a multitude of slain and a great number of corpses, no end of corpses! [The horsemen] stumble over the corpses! 













###### 4 






All because of the multitude of the harlotries [of Nineveh], the well-favored harlot, the mistress of deadly charms who betrays _and_ sells nations through her whoredoms [idolatry] and peoples through her enchantments. 













###### 5 






Behold, I am against you, says the Lord of hosts, and I will lift up your skirts over your face, and I will let the nations look on your nakedness [O Nineveh] and the kingdoms on your shame. 













###### 6 






I will cast abominable things at you _and_ make you filthy, treat you with contempt, and make you a gazingstock. 













###### 7 






And all who look on you will shrink _and_ flee from you and say, Nineveh is laid waste; who will pity _and_ bemoan her? Where [then] shall I seek comforters for you? 













###### 8 






Are you better than No-amon [Thebes, capital of Upper Egypt], that dwelt by the rivers _or_ canals, that had the waters round about her, whose rampart was a sea [the Nile] and water her wall? 













###### 9 






Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and that without limit. Put and the Libyans were _her_ helpers. 













###### 10 






Yet she was carried away; she went into captivity. Her young children also were dashed in pieces at all the street corners; lots were cast [by the Assyrian officers] for her nobles, and all her great men were bound with chains. 













###### 11 






You will be drunk [Nineveh, with the cup of God's wrath]; you will be dazed. You will seek _and_ require a refuge because of the enemy. 













###### 12 






All your fortresses are fig trees with early figs; if they are shaken they will fall into the mouth of the eater. 













###### 13 






Behold, your troops in the midst of you are [as weak and helpless as] women; the gates of your land are set wide open to your enemies [without effort]; fire consumes your bars. 













###### 14 






Draw for yourself the water [necessary] for a [long continued] siege, make strong your fortresses! Go down into the clay pits and trample the mortar; make ready the brickkiln [to burn bricks for the bulwarks]! 













###### 15 






[But] there [in the very midst of these preparations] will the fire devour you; the sword will cut you off; it will destroy you as the locusts [destroy]. Multiply yourselves like the licking locusts; make yourselves many like the swarming locusts! 













###### 16 






You increased your merchants more than the [visible] stars of the heavens. The swarming locust spreads itself _and_ destroys, and then flies away. 













###### 17 






Your princes are like the grasshoppers and your marshals like the swarms of locusts which encamp in the hedges on a cold day--but when the sun rises, they fly away, and no one knows where they are. 













###### 18 






Your shepherds are asleep, O king of Assyria; your nobles are lying still [in death]. Your people are scattered on the mountains and there is no one to gather them. 













###### 19 






There is no healing of your hurt; your wound is grievous. All who hear the news about you clap their hands over [what has happened to] you. For upon whom has not your [unceasing] evil come continually? ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

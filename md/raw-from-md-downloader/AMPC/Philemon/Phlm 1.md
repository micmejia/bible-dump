# Philemon 1

***














###### 1 






Paul, a prisoner [for the sake] of Christ Jesus (the Messiah), and our brother Timothy, to Philemon our dearly beloved sharer with us in our work, 













###### 2 






And to Apphia our sister and Archippus our fellow soldier [in the Christian warfare], and to the church [assembly that meets] in your house: 













###### 3 






Grace (spiritual blessing and favor) be to all of you and [heart] peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah). 













###### 4 






I give thanks to my God for you always when I mention you in my prayers, 













###### 5 






Because I continue to hear of your love and of your loyal faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and [which you show] toward all the saints (God's consecrated people). 













###### 6 






[And I pray] that the participation in _and_ sharing of your faith may produce _and_ promote full recognition _and_ appreciation _and_ understanding _and_ precise knowledge of every good [thing] that is ours in [our identification with] Christ _Jesus_ [and unto His glory]. 













###### 7 






For I have derived great joy and comfort _and_ encouragement from your love, because the hearts of the saints [who are your fellow Christians] have been cheered _and_ refreshed through you, [my] brother. 













###### 8 






Therefore, though I have abundant boldness in Christ to charge you to do what is fitting _and_ required _and_ your duty to do, 













###### 9 






Yet for love's sake I prefer to appeal to you just for what I am--I, Paul, an ambassador [of Christ Jesus] _and_ an old man and now a prisoner for His sake also-- 













###### 10 






I appeal to you for my [own spiritual] child, Onesimus [meaning profitable], whom I have begotten [in the faith] while a captive in these chains. 













###### 11 






Once he was unprofitable to you, but now he is indeed profitable to you as well as to me. 













###### 12 






I am sending him back to you in [^a]his own person, [and it is like sending] my very heart. 













###### 13 






I would have chosen to keep him with me, in order that he might minister to my needs in your stead during my imprisonment for the Gospel's sake. 













###### 14 






But it has been my wish to do nothing about it without first consulting you _and_ getting your consent, in order that your benevolence might not seem to be the result of compulsion _or_ of pressure but might be voluntary [on your part]. 













###### 15 






Perhaps it was for this reason that he was separated [from you] for a while, that you might have him back as yours forever, 













###### 16 






Not as a slave any longer but as [something] more than a slave, as a brother [Christian], especially dear to me but how much more to you, both in the flesh [as a servant] and in the Lord [as a fellow believer]. 













###### 17 






If then you consider me a partner _and_ a [^b]comrade in fellowship, welcome _and_ receive him as you would [welcome and receive] me. 













###### 18 






And if he has done you any wrong in any way or owes anything [to you], charge that to my account. 













###### 19 






I, Paul, write it with my own hand, I promise to repay it [in full]--and that is to say nothing [of the fact] that you owe me your very self! 













###### 20 






Yes, brother, let me have some profit from you in the Lord. Cheer _and_ refresh my heart in Christ. 













###### 21 






I write to you [perfectly] confident of your obedient compliance, knowing that you will do even more than I ask. 













###### 22 






At the same time prepare a guest room [in expectation of extending your hospitality] to me, for I am hoping through your prayers to be granted [the gracious privilege of coming] to you. 













###### 23 






Greetings to you from Epaphras, my fellow prisoner here in [the cause of] Christ Jesus (the Messiah), 













###### 24 






And [from] Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers. 













###### 25 






The grace (blessing and favor) of the Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) be with your spirit. _Amen (so be it)._ ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

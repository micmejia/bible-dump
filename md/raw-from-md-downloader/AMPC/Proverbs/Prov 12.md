# Proverbs 12

***














###### 1 






Whoever loves instruction _and_ correction loves knowledge, but he who hates reproof is like a brute beast, stupid _and_ indiscriminating. 













###### 2 






A good man obtains favor from the Lord, but a man of wicked devices He condemns. 













###### 3 






A man shall not be established by wickedness, but the root of the [uncompromisingly] righteous shall never be moved. 













###### 4 






A virtuous _and_ worthy wife [earnest and strong in character] is a crowning joy to her husband, but she who makes him ashamed is as rottenness in his bones. 













###### 5 






The thoughts _and_ purposes of the [consistently] righteous are honest _and_ reliable, but the counsels _and_ designs of the wicked are treacherous. 













###### 6 






The words of the wicked lie in wait for blood, but the mouth of the upright shall deliver them _and_ the innocent ones [thus endangered]. 













###### 7 






The wicked are overthrown and are not, but the house of the [uncompromisingly] righteous shall stand. 













###### 8 






A man shall be commended according to his Wisdom [godly Wisdom, which is comprehensive insight into the ways and purposes of God], but he who is of a perverse heart shall be despised. 













###### 9 






Better is he who is lightly esteemed but works for his own support than he who assumes honor for himself and lacks bread. 













###### 10 






A [consistently] righteous man regards the life of his beast, but even the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel. 













###### 11 






He who tills his land shall be satisfied with bread, but he who follows worthless pursuits is lacking in sense _and_ is without understanding. 













###### 12 






The wicked desire the booty of evil men, but the root of the [uncompromisingly] righteous yields [richer fruitage]. 













###### 13 






The wicked is [dangerously] snared by the transgression of his lips, but the [uncompromisingly] righteous shall come out of trouble. 













###### 14 






From the fruit of his words a man shall be satisfied with good, and the work of a man's hands shall come back to him [as a harvest]. 













###### 15 






The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, but he who listens to counsel is wise. 













###### 16 






A fool's wrath is quickly _and_ openly known, but a prudent man ignores an insult. 













###### 17 






He who breathes out truth shows forth righteousness (uprightness and right standing with God), but a false witness utters deceit. 













###### 18 






There are those who speak rashly, like the piercing of a sword, but the tongue of the wise brings healing. 













###### 19 






Truthful lips shall be established forever, but a lying tongue is [credited] but for a moment. 













###### 20 






Deceit is in the hearts of those who devise evil, but for the counselors of peace there is joy. 













###### 21 






No [actual] evil, misfortune, _or_ calamity shall come upon the righteous, but the wicked shall be filled with evil, misfortune, _and_ calamity. 













###### 22 






Lying lips are extremely disgusting _and_ hateful to the Lord, but they who deal faithfully are His delight. 













###### 23 






A prudent man is reluctant to display his knowledge, but the heart of [self-confident] fools proclaims their folly. 













###### 24 






The hand of the diligent will rule, but the slothful will be put to forced labor. 













###### 25 






Anxiety in a man's heart weighs it down, but an encouraging word makes it glad. 













###### 26 






The [consistently] righteous man is a guide to his neighbor, but the way of the wicked causes others to go astray. 













###### 27 






The slothful man does not catch his game _or_ roast it once he kills it, but the diligent man gets precious possessions. 













###### 28 






Life is in the way of righteousness (moral and spiritual rectitude in every area and relation), and in its pathway there is no death _but_ immortality (perpetual, eternal life). ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Proverbs 13

***














###### 1 






A wise son heeds [and is the fruit of] his father's instruction _and_ correction, but a scoffer listens not to rebuke. 













###### 2 






A good man eats good from the fruit of his mouth, but the desire of the treacherous is for violence. 













###### 3 






He who guards his mouth keeps his life, but he who opens wide his lips comes to ruin. 













###### 4 






The appetite of the sluggard craves and gets nothing, but the appetite of the diligent is abundantly supplied. 













###### 5 






A [consistently] righteous man hates lying _and_ deceit, but a wicked man is loathsome [his very breath spreads pollution] and he comes [surely] to shame. 













###### 6 






Righteousness (rightness and justice in every area and relation) guards him who is upright in the way, but wickedness plunges into sin _and_ overthrows the sinner. 













###### 7 






One man considers himself rich, yet has nothing [to keep permanently]; another man considers himself poor, yet has great [and indestructible] riches. 













###### 8 






A rich man can buy his way out of threatened death by paying a ransom, but the poor man does not even have to listen to threats [from the envious]. 













###### 9 






The light of the [uncompromisingly] righteous [is within him--it grows brighter and] rejoices, but the lamp of the wicked [furnishes only a derived, temporary light and] shall be put out shortly. 













###### 10 






By pride _and_ insolence comes only contention, but with the well-advised is skillful _and_ godly Wisdom. 













###### 11 






Wealth [not earned but] won in haste _or_ unjustly _or_ from the production of things for vain _or_ detrimental use [such riches] will dwindle away, but he who gathers little by little will increase [his riches]. 













###### 12 






Hope deferred makes the heart sick, but when the desire is fulfilled, it is a tree of life. 













###### 13 






Whoever despises the word _and_ counsel [of God] brings destruction upon himself, but he who [reverently] fears _and_ respects the commandment [of God] is rewarded. 













###### 14 






The teaching of the wise is a fountain of life, that one may avoid the snares of death. 













###### 15 






Good understanding wins favor, but the way of the transgressor is hard [like the barren, dry soil or the impassable swamp]. 













###### 16 






Every prudent man deals with knowledge, but a [self-confident] fool exposes _and_ flaunts his folly. 













###### 17 






A wicked messenger falls into evil, but a faithful ambassador brings healing. 













###### 18 






Poverty and shame come to him who refuses instruction _and_ correction, but he who heeds reproof is honored. 













###### 19 






Satisfied desire is sweet to a person; therefore it is hateful _and_ exceedingly offensive to [self-confident] fools to give up evil [upon which they have set their hearts]. 













###### 20 






He who walks [as a companion] with wise men is wise, but he who associates with [self-confident] fools is [a fool himself and] shall smart for it. 













###### 21 






Evil pursues sinners, but the consistently upright _and_ in right standing with God is recompensed with good. 













###### 22 






A good man leaves an inheritance [of moral stability and goodness] to his children's children, and the wealth of the sinner [finds its way eventually] into the hands of the righteous, for whom it was laid up. 













###### 23 






Much food is in the tilled land of the poor, but there are those who are destroyed because of injustice. 













###### 24 






He who spares his rod [of discipline] hates his son, but he who loves him disciplines diligently _and_ punishes him early. 













###### 25 






The [uncompromisingly] righteous eats to his own satisfaction, but the stomach of the wicked is in want. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Proverbs 20

***














###### 1 






Wine is a mocker, strong drink a riotous brawler; and whoever errs _or_ reels because of it is not wise. 













###### 2 






The terror of a king is as the roaring of a lion; whoever provokes him to anger _or_ angers himself against him sins against his own life. 













###### 3 






It is an honor for a man to cease from strife _and_ keep aloof from it, but every fool will quarrel. 













###### 4 






The sluggard does not plow when winter sets in; therefore he begs in harvest and has nothing. 













###### 5 






Counsel in the heart of man is like water in a deep well, but a man of understanding draws it out. 













###### 6 






Many a man proclaims his own loving-kindness _and_ goodness, but a faithful man who can find? 













###### 7 






The righteous man walks in his integrity; blessed (happy, fortunate, enviable) are his children after him. 













###### 8 






A king who sits on the throne of judgment winnows out all evil [like chaff] with his eyes. 













###### 9 






Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin? 













###### 10 






Diverse weights [one for buying and another for selling] and diverse measures--both of them are exceedingly offensive _and_ abhorrent to the Lord. 













###### 11 






Even a child is known by his acts, whether [or not] what he does is pure and right. 













###### 12 






The hearing ear and the seeing eye--the Lord has made both of them. 













###### 13 






Love not sleep, lest you come to poverty; open your eyes and you will be satisfied with bread. 













###### 14 






It is worthless, it is worthless! says the buyer; but when he goes his way, then he boasts [about his bargain]. 













###### 15 






There is gold, and a multitude of pearls, but the lips of knowledge are a vase of preciousness [the most precious of all]. 













###### 16 






[The judge tells the creditor] Take the garment of one who is security for a stranger; and hold him in pledge when he is security for foreigners. 













###### 17 






Food gained by deceit is sweet to a man, but afterward his mouth will be filled with gravel. 













###### 18 






Purposes _and_ plans are established by counsel; and [only] with good advice make _or_ carry on war. 













###### 19 






He who goes about as a talebearer reveals secrets; therefore associate not with him who talks too freely. 













###### 20 






Whoever curses his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in complete darkness. 













###### 21 






An inheritance hastily gotten [by greedy, unjust means] at the beginning, in the end it will not be blessed. 













###### 22 






Do not say, I will repay evil; wait [expectantly] for the Lord, and He will rescue you. 













###### 23 






Diverse _and_ deceitful weights are shamefully vile _and_ abhorrent to the Lord, and false scales are not good. 













###### 24 






Man's steps are ordered by the Lord. How then can a man understand his way? 













###### 25 






It is a snare to a man to utter a vow [of consecration] rashly and [not until] afterward inquire [whether he can fulfill it]. 













###### 26 






A wise king winnows out the wicked [from among the good] and brings the threshing wheel over them [to separate the chaff from the grain]. 













###### 27 






The spirit of man [that factor in human personality which proceeds immediately from God] is the lamp of the Lord, searching all his innermost parts. 













###### 28 






Loving-kindness _and_ mercy, truth _and_ faithfulness, preserve the king, and his throne is upheld by [the people's] loyalty. 













###### 29 






The glory of young men is their strength, and the beauty of old men is their gray head [suggesting wisdom and experience]. 













###### 30 






Blows that wound cleanse away evil, and strokes [for correction] reach to the innermost parts. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

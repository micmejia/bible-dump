# Proverbs 9

***














###### 1 






Wisdom has built her house; she has hewn out _and_ set up her seven [perfect number of] pillars. 













###### 2 






She has killed her beasts, she has mixed her [spiritual] wine; she has also set her table. 













###### 3 






She has sent out her maids to cry from the highest places of the town: 













###### 4 






Whoever is simple (easily led astray and wavering), let him turn in here! As for him who lacks understanding, [God's] Wisdom says to him, 













###### 5 






Come, eat of my bread and drink of the [spiritual] wine which I have mixed. 













###### 6 






Leave off, simple ones [forsake the foolish and simpleminded] and live! And walk in the way of insight _and_ understanding. 













###### 7 






He who rebukes a scorner heaps upon himself abuse, and he who reproves a wicked man gets for himself bruises. 













###### 8 






Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate you; reprove a wise man, and he will love you. 













###### 9 






Give instruction to a wise man and he will be yet wiser; teach a righteous man (one upright and in right standing with God) and he will increase in learning. 













###### 10 






The reverent _and_ worshipful fear of the Lord is the beginning (the chief and choice part) of Wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is insight _and_ understanding. 













###### 11 






For by me [Wisdom from God] your days shall be multiplied, and the years of your life shall be increased. 













###### 12 






If you are wise, you are wise for yourself; if you scorn, you alone will bear it _and_ pay the penalty. 













###### 13 






The foolish woman is noisy; she is simple _and_ open to all forms of evil, she [willfully and recklessly] knows nothing whatever [of eternal value]. 













###### 14 






For she sits at the door of her house _or_ on a seat in the conspicuous places of the town, 













###### 15 






Calling to those who pass by, who go uprightly on their way: 













###### 16 






Whoever is simple (wavering and easily led astray), let him turn in here! And as for him who lacks understanding, she says to him, 













###### 17 






Stolen waters (pleasures) are sweet [because they are forbidden]; and bread eaten in secret is pleasant. 













###### 18 






But he knows not that the shades of the dead are there [specters haunting the scene of past transgressions], and that her invited guests are [already sunk] in the depths of Sheol (the lower world, Hades, the place of the dead). ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

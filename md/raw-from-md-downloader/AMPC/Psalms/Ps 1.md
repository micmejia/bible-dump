# Psalms 1

***














###### 1 






Blessed (happy, fortunate, prosperous, and enviable) is the man who walks _and_ lives not in the counsel of the ungodly [following their advice, their plans and purposes], nor stands [submissive and inactive] in the path where sinners walk, nor sits down [to relax and rest] where the scornful [and the mockers] gather. 













###### 2 






But his delight _and_ desire are in the law of the Lord, and on His law (the precepts, the instructions, the teachings of God) he habitually meditates (ponders and studies) by day and by night. 













###### 3 






And he shall be like a tree firmly planted [and tended] by the streams of water, ready to bring forth its fruit in its season; its leaf also shall not fade _or_ wither; and everything he does shall prosper [and come to maturity]. 













###### 4 






Not so the wicked [those disobedient and living without God are not so]. But they are like the chaff [worthless, dead, without substance] which the wind drives away. 













###### 5 






Therefore the wicked [those disobedient and living without God] shall not stand [justified] in the judgment, nor [^b]sinners in the congregation of the righteous [those who are upright and in right standing with God]. 













###### 6 






For the Lord knows _and_ is fully acquainted with the way of the righteous, but the way of the ungodly [those living outside God's will] shall perish (end in ruin and come to nought). ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: Psalm 1:5 Charles Haddon Spurgeon (_The Treasury of David_) said, “Sinners cannot live in heaven. They would be out of their element. Sooner could a fish live upon a tree than the wicked in paradise.” The only way they will ever be able to endure heaven is to be born again and become new creatures with pure hearts able fully to enjoy the presence of God, His holy angels, and the redeemed.

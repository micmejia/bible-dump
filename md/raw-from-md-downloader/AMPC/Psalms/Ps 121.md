# Psalms 121

***














###### 1 






I will lift up my eyes to the hills [around Jerusalem, to sacred Mount Zion and Mount Moriah]--From whence shall my help come? 













###### 2 






My help comes from the Lord, Who made heaven and earth. 













###### 3 






He will not allow your foot to slip _or_ to be moved; He Who keeps you will not slumber. 













###### 4 






Behold, He who keeps Israel will neither slumber nor sleep. 













###### 5 






The Lord is your keeper; the Lord is your shade on your right hand [the side not carrying a shield]. 













###### 6 






The sun shall not smite you by day, nor the moon by night. 













###### 7 






The Lord will keep you from all evil; He will keep your life. 













###### 8 






The Lord will keep your going out and your coming in from this time forth and forevermore. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Psalms 123

***














###### 1 






Unto You do I lift up my eyes, O You Who are enthroned in heaven. 













###### 2 






Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master, and as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress, so our eyes look to the Lord our God, until He has mercy _and_ loving-kindness for us. 













###### 3 






Have mercy on us, O Lord, have mercy on _and_ loving-kindness for us, for we are exceedingly satiated with contempt. 













###### 4 






Our life is exceedingly filled with the scorning _and_ scoffing of those who are at ease and with the contempt of the proud (irresponsible tyrants who disregard God's law). ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Psalms 126

***














###### 1 






When the Lord brought back the captives [who returned] to Zion, we were like those who dream [it seemed so unreal]. 













###### 2 






Then were our mouths filled with laughter, and our tongues with singing. Then they said among the nations, The Lord has done great things for them. 













###### 3 






The Lord has done great things for us! We are glad! 













###### 4 






Turn to freedom our captivity _and_ restore our fortunes, O Lord, as the streams in the South (the Negeb) [are restored by the torrents]. 













###### 5 






They who sow in tears shall reap in joy _and_ singing. 













###### 6 






He who goes forth bearing seed and weeping [at needing his precious supply of grain for sowing] shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

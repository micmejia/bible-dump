# Psalms 129

***














###### 1 






Many a time _and_ much have they afflicted me from my youth up--let Israel now say-- 













###### 2 






Many a time _and_ much have they afflicted me from my youth up, yet they have not prevailed against me. 













###### 3 






The plowers plowed upon my back; they made long their furrows. 













###### 4 






The Lord is [uncompromisingly] righteous; He has cut asunder the thick cords by which the wicked [enslaved us]. 













###### 5 






Let them all be put to shame and turned backward who hate Zion. 













###### 6 






Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withers before it grows up, 













###### 7 






With which the mower fills not his hand, nor the binder of sheaves his bosom-- 













###### 8 






While those who go by do not say, The blessing of the Lord be upon you! We bless you in the name of the Lord! ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

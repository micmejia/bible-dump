# Psalms 150

***














###### 1 






Praise the Lord! Praise God in His sanctuary; praise Him in the heavens of His power! 













###### 2 






Praise Him for His mighty acts; praise Him according to the abundance of His greatness! 













###### 3 






Praise Him with trumpet sound; praise Him with lute and harp! 













###### 4 






Praise Him with tambourine and [single or group] dance; praise Him with stringed and wind instruments _or_ flutes! 













###### 5 






Praise Him with resounding cymbals; praise Him with loud clashing cymbals! 













###### 6 






Let everything that has breath _and_ every breath of life praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!

# Psalms 45

***














###### 1 






My heart overflows with a [^a]goodly theme; I address my psalm to a King. My tongue is like the pen of a ready writer. 













###### 2 






You are fairer than the children of men; graciousness is poured upon Your lips; therefore God has blessed You forever. 













###### 3 






Gird Your sword upon Your thigh, O mighty One, in Your glory and Your majesty! 













###### 4 






And in Your majesty ride on triumphantly for the cause of truth, humility, _and_ righteousness (uprightness and right standing with God); and let Your right hand guide You to tremendous things. 













###### 5 






Your arrows are sharp; the peoples fall under You; Your darts pierce the hearts of the King's enemies. 













###### 6 






Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; the scepter of righteousness is the scepter of Your kingdom. 













###### 7 






You love righteousness, uprightness, _and_ right standing with God and hate wickedness; therefore God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of gladness above Your fellows. 













###### 8 






Your garments are all fragrant with myrrh, aloes, _and_ cassia; stringed instruments make You glad. 













###### 9 






Kings' daughters are among Your honorable women; at Your right hand stands the queen in gold of Ophir. 













###### 10 






Hear, O daughter, consider, submit, _and_ consent to my instruction: forget also your own people and your father's house; 













###### 11 






So will the King desire your beauty; because He is your Lord, be submissive _and_ reverence _and_ honor Him. 













###### 12 






And, O daughter of Tyre, the richest of the people shall entreat your favor with a gift. 













###### 13 






The King's daughter in the inner part [of the palace] is all glorious; her clothing is inwrought with gold. 













###### 14 






She shall be brought to the King in raiment of needlework; with the virgins, her companions that follow her, she shall be brought to You. 













###### 15 






With gladness and rejoicing will they be brought; they will enter into the King's palace. 













###### 16 






Instead of Your fathers shall be Your sons, whom You will make princes in all the land. 













###### 17 






I will make Your name to be remembered in all generations; therefore shall the people praise and give You thanks forever and ever. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

This is one such Messianic psalm. However, the capitalization indicating the deity is offered provisionally. The chapter is written against the background of a secular royal wedding. But the New Testament reference to this psalm in Heb. 1:8, 9, where verses 6 and 7 of Psalm 45 are quoted and applied to Christ, makes any other interpretation seem incidental in importance.

# Revelation 1

***














###### 1 






[This is] the revelation of Jesus Christ [His unveiling of the divine mysteries]. God gave it to Him to disclose _and_ make known to His bond servants certain things which must shortly _and_ speedily come to pass [^a]in their entirety. And He sent and communicated it through His angel (messenger) to His bond servant John, 













###### 2 






Who has testified to _and_ vouched for all that he saw [[^b]in his visions], the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ. 













###### 3 






Blessed (happy, [^c]to be envied) is the man who reads aloud [in the assemblies] the word of this prophecy; and blessed (happy, [^d]to be envied) are those who hear [it read] and who keep themselves true to the things which are written in it [heeding them and laying them to heart], for the time [for them to be fulfilled] is near. 













###### 4 






John to the seven assemblies (churches) that are in Asia: May grace (God's unmerited favor) be granted to you and spiritual peace ([^e]the peace of Christ's kingdom) from Him Who is and Who was and Who is to come, and from the seven Spirits [[^f]the sevenfold Holy Spirit] before His throne, 













###### 5 






And from Jesus Christ the faithful _and_ trustworthy Witness, the Firstborn of the dead [first to be brought back to life] and the Prince (Ruler) of the kings of the earth. To Him Who [^g]ever loves us and has [^h]once [for all] loosed _and_ freed us from our sins by His own blood, 













###### 6 






And formed us into a kingdom (a royal race), priests to His God and Father--to Him be the glory and the power _and_ the majesty and the dominion throughout the ages _and_ forever and ever. Amen (so be it). 













###### 7 






Behold, He is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see Him, even those who pierced Him; and all the tribes of the earth shall gaze upon Him _and_ beat their breasts _and_ mourn _and_ lament over Him. Even so [must it be]. Amen (so be it). 













###### 8 






I am the Alpha and the Omega, _the Beginning and the End_, says the Lord God, He Who is and Who was and Who is to come, the Almighty (the Ruler of all). 













###### 9 






I, John, your brother and companion (sharer and participator) with you in the tribulation and kingdom and patient endurance [which are] in Jesus _Christ_, was on the isle called Patmos, [banished] on account of [my witnessing to] the Word of God and the testimony (the proof, the evidence) for Jesus _Christ_. 













###### 10 






I was in the Spirit [rapt in His power] on the Lord's Day, and I heard behind me a great voice like the calling of a [^i]war trumpet, 













###### 11 






Saying, _I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last_. Write promptly what you see (your vision) in a book and send it to the seven churches _which are in Asia_--to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea. 













###### 12 






Then I turned to see [whose was] the voice that was speaking to me, and on turning I saw seven golden lampstands, 













###### 13 






And in the midst of the lampstands [One] like a Son of Man, clothed with a robe which reached to His feet and with a girdle of gold about His breast. 













###### 14 






His head and His hair were white like white wool, [as white] as snow, and His eyes [flashed] like a flame of fire. 













###### 15 






His feet glowed like burnished (bright) bronze as it is refined in a furnace, and His voice was like the sound of many waters. 













###### 16 






In His right hand He held seven stars, and from His mouth there came forth a sharp two-edged sword, and His face was like the sun shining in full power at midday. 













###### 17 






When I saw Him, I fell at His feet as if dead. But He laid His right hand on me and said, Do not be afraid! I am the First and the Last, 













###### 18 






And the Ever-living One [I am living in the eternity of the eternities]. I died, but see, I am alive forevermore; and I possess the keys of death and Hades (the realm of the dead). 













###### 19 






Write therefore the things you see, what they are [and signify] and what is to take place hereafter. 













###### 20 






As to the hidden meaning (the mystery) of the seven stars which you saw on My right hand and the seven lampstands of gold: the seven stars are the seven angels (messengers) of the seven assemblies (churches) and the seven lampstands are the seven churches. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Romans 7

***














###### 1 






Do you not know, brethren--for I am speaking to men who are acquainted with the Law--that legal claims have power over a person only for as long as he is alive? 













###### 2 






For [instance] a married woman is bound by law to her husband as long as he lives; but if her husband dies, she is loosed _and_ discharged from the law concerning her husband. 













###### 3 






Accordingly, she will be held an adulteress if she unites herself to another man while her husband lives. But if her husband dies, the marriage law no longer is binding on her [she is free from that law]; and if she unites herself to another man, she is not an adulteress. 













###### 4 






Likewise, my brethren, you have undergone death as to the Law through the [crucified] body of Christ, so that now you may belong to Another, to Him Who was raised from the dead in order that we may bear fruit for God. 













###### 5 






When we were living in the flesh (mere physical lives), the sinful passions that were awakened _and_ aroused up by [what] the Law [makes sin] were constantly operating in our natural powers (in our bodily organs, [^a]in the sensitive appetites and wills of the flesh), so that we bore fruit for death. 













###### 6 






But now we are discharged from the Law _and_ have terminated all intercourse with it, having died to what once restrained _and_ held us captive. So now we serve not under [obedience to] the old code of written regulations, but [under obedience to the promptings] of the Spirit in newness [of life]. 













###### 7 






What then do we conclude? Is the Law identical with sin? Certainly not! Nevertheless, if it had not been for the Law, I should not have recognized sin _or_ have known its meaning. [For instance] I would not have known about covetousness [would have had no consciousness of sin or sense of guilt] if the Law had not [repeatedly] said, You shall not covet _and_ have an evil desire [for one thing and another]. 













###### 8 






But sin, finding opportunity in the commandment [to express itself], got a hold on me _and_ aroused _and_ stimulated all kinds of forbidden desires (lust, covetousness). For without the Law sin is dead [the sense of it is inactive and a lifeless thing]. 













###### 9 






Once I was alive, but quite apart from _and_ unconscious of the Law. But when the commandment came, sin lived again and I died (was sentenced by the Law to death). 













###### 10 






And the very legal ordinance which was designed _and_ intended to bring life actually proved [to mean to me] death. 













###### 11 






For sin, seizing the opportunity _and_ getting a hold on me [by taking its incentive] from the commandment, beguiled _and_ entrapped _and_ cheated me, and using it [as a weapon], killed me. 













###### 12 






The Law therefore is holy, and [each] commandment is holy and just and good. 













###### 13 






Did that which is good then prove fatal [bringing death] to me? Certainly not! It was sin, working death in me by using this good thing [as a weapon], in order that through the commandment sin might be shown up clearly to be sin, that the extreme malignity and immeasurable sinfulness of sin might plainly appear. 













###### 14 






We know that the Law is spiritual; but I am a creature of the flesh [carnal, unspiritual], having been sold into slavery under [the control of] sin. 













###### 15 






For I do not understand my own actions [I am baffled, bewildered]. I do not practice _or_ accomplish what I wish, but I do the very thing that I loathe [[^b]which my moral instinct condemns]. 













###### 16 






Now if I do [habitually] what is contrary to my desire, [that means that] I acknowledge _and_ agree that the Law is good (morally excellent) _and_ that I take sides with it. 













###### 17 






However, it is no longer I who do the deed, but the sin [principle] which is at home in me _and_ has possession of me. 













###### 18 






For I know that nothing good dwells within me, that is, in my flesh. I can will what is right, but I cannot perform it. [I have the intention and urge to do what is right, but no power to carry it out.] 













###### 19 






For I fail to practice the good deeds I desire to do, but the evil deeds that I do not desire to do are what I am [ever] doing. 













###### 20 






Now if I do what I do not desire to do, it is no longer I doing it [it is not myself that acts], but the sin [principle] which dwells within me [[^c]fixed and operating in my soul]. 













###### 21 






So I find it to be a law (rule of action of my being) that when I want to do what is right _and_ good, evil is ever present with me _and_ I am subject to its insistent demands. 













###### 22 






For I endorse _and_ delight in the Law of God in my inmost self [with my new nature]. 













###### 23 






But I discern in my bodily members [[^d]in the sensitive appetites and wills of the flesh] a different law (rule of action) at war against the law of my mind (my reason) and making me a prisoner to the law of sin that dwells in my bodily organs [[^e]in the sensitive appetites and wills of the flesh]. 













###### 24 






O unhappy _and_ pitiable _and_ wretched man that I am! Who will release _and_ deliver me from [the shackles of] this body of death? 













###### 25 






O thank God! [He will!] through Jesus Christ (the Anointed One) our Lord! So then indeed I, of myself with the mind _and_ heart, serve the Law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

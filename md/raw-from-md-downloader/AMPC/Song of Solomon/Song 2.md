# Song of Solomon 2

***














###### 1 






[She said] I am only a little rose _or_ autumn crocus of the plain of Sharon, or a [humble] lily of the valleys [that grows in deep and difficult places]. 













###### 2 






But Solomon replied, Like the lily among thorns, so are you, my love, among the daughters. 













###### 3 






Like an apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved [shepherd] among the sons [cried the girl]! Under his shadow I delighted to sit, and his fruit was sweet to my taste. 













###### 4 






He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love [for love waved as a protecting and comforting banner over my head when I was near him]. 













###### 5 






Sustain me with raisins, refresh me with apples, for I am sick with love. 













###### 6 






[I can feel] [^a]his left hand under my head and his right hand embraces me! 













###### 7 






[He said] I charge you, O you daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles or by the hinds of the field [which are free to follow their own instincts] that you not try to stir up or awaken [my] love until it pleases. 













###### 8 






[Vividly she pictured it] The voice of my beloved [shepherd]! Behold, he comes, leaping upon the mountains, bounding over the hills. 













###### 9 






My beloved is like a gazelle or a young hart. Behold, he stands behind the wall of our house, he looks in through the windows, he glances through the lattice. 













###### 10 






My beloved speaks and says to me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away. 













###### 11 






For, behold, the winter is past; the rain is over and gone. 













###### 12 






The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing [of birds] has come, and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. 













###### 13 






The fig tree puts forth _and_ ripens her green figs, and the vines are in blossom and give forth their fragrance. [^b]Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. 













###### 14 






[So I went with him, and when we were climbing the rocky steps up the hillside, my beloved shepherd said to me] O my dove, [while you are here] in the seclusion of the clefts in the solid rock, in the sheltered _and_ secret place of the cliff, let me see your face, [^c]let me hear your voice; for your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely. 













###### 15 






[My heart was touched and I fervently sang to him my desire] Take for us the foxes, the [^d]little foxes that spoil the vineyards [of our love], for our vineyards are in blossom. 













###### 16 






[She said distinctly] My beloved is mine and I am his! He pastures his flocks among the lilies. 













###### 17 






[Then, longingly addressing her absent shepherd, she cried] Until the day breaks and the shadows flee away, return hastily, O my beloved, and be like a gazelle or a young hart as you cover the mountains [which separate us]. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

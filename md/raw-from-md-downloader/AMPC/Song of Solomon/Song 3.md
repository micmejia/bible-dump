# Song of Solomon 3

***














###### 1 






In the night I dreamed that I sought the one whom I love. [She said] I looked for him but could not find him. 













###### 2 






So I decided to go out into the city, into the streets and broad ways [which are so confusing to a country girl], and seek him whom my soul loves. I sought him, but I could not find him. 













###### 3 






The watchmen who go about the city found me, to whom I said, Have you seen him whom my soul loves? 













###### 4 






I had gone but a little way past them when I found him whom my soul loves. I held him and would not let him go until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the chamber of her who conceived me. 













###### 5 






I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles or by the hinds of the field that you stir not up nor awaken love until it pleases. 













###### 6 






Who _or_ what is this [she asked] that comes gliding out of the wilderness like stately pillars of smoke perfumed with myrrh, frankincense, and all the fragrant powders of the merchant? 













###### 7 






[Someone answered] Behold, it is the traveling litter (the bridal car) of Solomon. Sixty mighty men are around it, of the mighty men of Israel. 













###### 8 






They all handle the sword and are expert in war; every man has his sword upon his thigh, that fear be not excited in the night. 













###### 9 






King Solomon made himself a car _or_ a palanquin from the [cedar] wood of Lebanon. 













###### 10 






He made its posts of silver, its back of gold, its seat of purple, the inside of it lovingly _and_ intricately wrought in needlework by the daughters of Jerusalem. 













###### 11 






Go forth, O you daughters of Zion, and gaze upon King Solomon wearing the crown with which his mother [Bathsheba] crowned him on the day of his wedding, on the day of his gladness of heart. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Zechariah 11

***














###### 1 






Open your doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour your cedars! 













###### 2 






Wail, O fir tree _and_ cypress, for the cedar has fallen, because the glorious _and_ lofty trees are laid waste! Wail, O you oaks of Bashan, for the thick _and_ inaccessible forest [on the steep mountainside] has in flames been felled! 













###### 3 






A voice of the wailing of the shepherds, for their glory, the broad pasturage, is laid waste! A voice of the roaring of young lions, for the pride of the Jordan [the jungle or thickets] is ruined! 













###### 4 






Thus says the Lord my God: Shepherd the flock [destined] for slaughter, 













###### 5 






Whose buyers _or_ possessors slay them and hold themselves not guilty; and they who sell them say, Blessed be the Lord, for I have become rich! And their own shepherds neither pity _nor_ spare them [from the wolves]. 













###### 6 






For I will no more pity _or_ spare the inhabitants of the land, says the Lord; but behold, I will deliver every man into his neighbor's hand and into the hand of his [foreign] king. And [the enemy] shall lay waste the land, and I will not deliver [the people] out of the hand [of the foreign oppressor]. 













###### 7 






So I [Zechariah] shepherded the flock of slaughter, truly [as the name implies] the most miserable of sheep. And I took two [shepherd's] staffs, the one I called Beauty _or_ Grace and the other I called Bands _or_ Union; and I fed _and_ shepherded the flock. 













###### 8 






And I cut off the three shepherds [the civil authorities, the priests, and the prophets] in one month, for I was weary _and_ impatient with them, and they also loathed me. 













###### 9 






So I [Zechariah] said, I will not be your shepherd. What is to die, let it die, and what is to be destroyed, let it be destroyed; and let the survivors devour one another's flesh. 













###### 10 






And I took my staff, Beauty _or_ Grace, and broke it in pieces to show that I was annulling the covenant _or_ agreement which I had made with all the peoples [not to molest them]. 













###### 11 






So the covenant was annulled on that day, and thus the most wretched of the flock _and_ the traffickers in the sheep who were watching me knew (recognized and understood) that it was truly the word of the Lord. 













###### 12 






And I said to them, If it seems just _and_ right to you, give me my wages; but if not, withhold them. So they weighed out for my price thirty pieces of silver. 













###### 13 






And the Lord said to me, Cast it to the potter [as if He said, To the dogs!]--the munificently [miserable] sum at which I [and My shepherd] am priced by them! And I [Zechariah] took the thirty pieces of silver and cast them to the potter in the house of the Lord. 













###### 14 






Then I broke into pieces my other staff, Bands _or_ Union, indicating that I was annulling the brotherhood between Judah and Israel. 













###### 15 






And the Lord said to me, Take up once more the implements [the staff and rod of a shepherd, but this time] of a worthless _and_ wicked shepherd. 













###### 16 






For behold, I will raise up a false shepherd in the land; the lost _and_ perishing he will not miss _or_ visit, the young _and_ scattered he will not go to seek, the wounded _and_ broken he will not heal, nor will he feed those that are sound _and_ strong; but he will eat the flesh of the fat ones and break off their hoofs [to consume all the flesh]. 













###### 17 






Woe to the worthless _and_ foolish shepherd who deserts the flock! The sword shall smite his arm and his right eye; his arm shall be utterly withered and his right eye utterly blinded. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

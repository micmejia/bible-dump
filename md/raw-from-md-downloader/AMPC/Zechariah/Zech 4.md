# Zechariah 4

***














###### 1 






And the angel who talked with me came again and awakened me, like a man who is wakened out of his sleep. 













###### 2 






And said to me, What do you see? I said, I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold, with its bowl [for oil] on the top of it and its seven lamps on it, and [there are] seven pipes to each of the seven lamps which are upon the top of it. 













###### 3 






And there are two olive trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side of it [feeding it continuously with oil]. 













###### 4 






So I asked the angel who talked with me, What are these, my lord? 













###### 5 






Then the angel who talked with me answered me, Do you not know what these are? And I said, No, my lord. 













###### 6 






Then he said to me, This [addition of the bowl to the candlestick, causing it to yield a ceaseless supply of oil from the olive trees] is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit [of Whom the oil is a symbol], says the Lord of hosts. 













###### 7 






For who are you, O great mountain [of human obstacles]? Before Zerubbabel [who with Joshua had led the return of the exiles from Babylon and was undertaking the rebuilding of the temple, before him] you shall become a plain [a mere [^a]molehill]! And he shall bring forth the finishing gable stone [of the new temple] with loud shoutings of the people, crying, Grace, grace to it! 













###### 8 






Moreover, the word of the Lord came to me, saying, 













###### 9 






The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundations of this house; his hands shall also finish it. Then you shall know (recognize and understand) that the Lord of hosts has sent me [His messenger] to you. 













###### 10 






Who [with reason] despises the day of small things? For these seven shall rejoice when they see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel. [These seven] are the eyes of the Lord which run to and fro throughout the whole earth. 













###### 11 






Then I said to him [the angel who talked with me], What are these two olive trees on the right side of the lampstand and on the left side of it? 













###### 12 






And a second time I said to him, What are these two olive branches which are beside the two golden tubes _or_ spouts by which the golden oil is emptied out? 













###### 13 






And he answered me, Do you not know what these are? And I said, No, my lord. 













###### 14 






Then said he, These are the two [^b]sons of oil [Joshua the high priest and Zerubbabel the prince of Judah, the two anointed ones] who stand before the Lord of the whole earth [as His anointed instruments]. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

[^b]: Zechariah 4:14 The oil used in anointing symbolizes the Holy Spirit (Zech. 4:6). The combination of priest and ruler points ultimately to the Messianic Priest-King (Ps. 110; Zech. 6:13; Heb. 7).

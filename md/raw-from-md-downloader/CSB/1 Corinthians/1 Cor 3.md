# 1 Corinthians 3

***










###### 1 




For my part, brothers and sisters, I was not able to speak to you as spiritual people but as people of the flesh, as babies in Christ. 









###### 2 




I gave you milk to drink, not solid food, since you were not yet ready for it. In fact, you are still not ready, 









###### 3 




because you are still worldly. For since there is envy and strife[^a] among you, are you not worldly and behaving like mere humans? 









###### 4 




For whenever someone says, "I belong to Paul," and another, "I belong to Apollos," are you not acting like mere humans? ## The Role of God's Servants 









###### 5 




What then is Apollos? What is Paul? They are servants through whom you believed, and each has the role the Lord has given. 









###### 6 




I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth. 









###### 7 




So, then, neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth. 









###### 8 




Now he who plants and he who waters are one,[^b] and each will receive his own reward according to his own labor. 









###### 9 




For we are God's coworkers.[^c] You are God's field, God's building. 









###### 10 




According to God's grace that was given to me, I have laid a foundation as a skilled master builder,[^d] and another builds on it. But each one is to be careful how he builds on it. 









###### 11 




For no one can lay any foundation other than what has been laid down. That foundation is Jesus Christ. 









###### 12 




If anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or straw, 









###### 13 




each one's work will become obvious. For the day will disclose it, because it will be revealed by fire; the fire will test the quality of each one's work. 









###### 14 




If anyone's work that he has built survives, he will receive a reward. 









###### 15 




If anyone's work is burned up, he will experience[^e] loss, but he himself will be saved--but only as through fire. 









###### 16 




Don't you yourselves know that you are God's temple and that the Spirit of God lives in you? 









###### 17 




If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy him; for God's temple is holy, and that is what you are. ## The Folly of Human Wisdom 









###### 18 




Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you thinks he is wise in this age, let him become a fool so that he can become wise. 









###### 19 




For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God, since it is written, <b class="quote">He catches the wise in their craftiness**;[^f] 









###### 20 




and again, <b class="quote">The Lord knows that the reasonings** <b class="quote">of the wise are futile.**[^g] 









###### 21 




So let no one boast in human leaders, for everything is yours-- 









###### 22 




whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come--everything is yours, 









###### 23 




and you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# 1 Corinthians 5

***










###### 1 




It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and the kind of sexual immorality that is not even tolerated[^a] among the Gentiles--a man is sleeping with his father's wife. 









###### 2 




And you are arrogant! Shouldn't you be filled with grief and remove from your congregation the one who did this? 









###### 3 




Even though I am absent in the body, I am present in spirit. As one who is present with you in this way, I have already pronounced judgment on the one who has been doing such a thing. 









###### 4 




When you are assembled in the name of our Lord Jesus, and I am with you in spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus, 









###### 5 




hand that one over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord. 









###### 6 




Your boasting is not good. Don't you know that a little leaven[^b] leavens the whole batch of dough? 









###### 7 




Clean out the old leaven so that you may be a new unleavened batch, as indeed you are. For Christ our Passover lamb has been sacrificed.[^c] 









###### 8 




Therefore, let us observe the feast, not with old leaven or with the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. ## Church Discipline 









###### 9 




I wrote to you in a letter not to associate with sexually immoral people. 









###### 10 




I did not mean the immoral people of this world or the greedy and swindlers or idolaters; otherwise you would have to leave the world. 









###### 11 




But actually, I wrote[^d] you not to associate with anyone who claims to be a brother or sister and is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or verbally abusive, a drunkard or a swindler. Do not even eat with such a person. 









###### 12 




For what business is it of mine to judge outsiders? Don't you judge those who are inside? 









###### 13 




God judges outsiders. <b class="quote">Remove the evil person from among you.**[^e] ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

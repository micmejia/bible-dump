# 1 John 1

***










###### 1 




What was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we have observed and have touched with our hands, concerning the word of life-- 









###### 2 




that life was revealed, and we have seen it and we testify and declare to you the eternal life that was with the Father and was revealed to us-- 









###### 3 




what we have seen and heard we also declare to you, so that you may also have fellowship with us; and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ. 









###### 4 




We are writing these things[^a] so that our[^b] joy may be complete. ## Fellowship with God 









###### 5 




This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you: God is light, and there is absolutely no darkness in him. 









###### 6 




If we say, "We have fellowship with him," and yet we walk in darkness, we are lying and are not practicing the truth. 









###### 7 




If we walk in the light as he himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin. 









###### 8 




If we say, "We have no sin," we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us. 









###### 9 




If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 









###### 10 




If we say, "We have not sinned," we make him a liar, and his word is not in us. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

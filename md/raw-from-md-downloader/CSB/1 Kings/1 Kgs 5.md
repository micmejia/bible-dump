# 1 Kings 5

***










###### 1 




King Hiram of Tyre sent his emissaries to Solomon when he heard that he had been anointed king in his father's place, for Hiram had always been friends with David. 









###### 2 




Solomon sent this message to Hiram: 









###### 3 




"You know my father David was not able to build a temple for the name of the Lord his God. This was because of the warfare all around him until the Lord put his enemies under his feet. 









###### 4 




The Lord my God has now given me rest on every side; there is no enemy or misfortune. 









###### 5 




So I plan to build a temple for the name of the Lord my God, according to what the Lord promised my father David: 'I will put your son on your throne in your place, and he will build the temple for my name.' 









###### 6 




"Therefore, command that cedars from Lebanon be cut down for me. My servants will be with your servants, and I will pay your servants' wages according to whatever you say, for you know that not a man among us knows how to cut timber like the Sidonians." 









###### 7 




When Hiram heard Solomon's words, he rejoiced greatly and said, "Blessed be the Lord today! He has given David a wise son to be over this great people!" 









###### 8 




Then Hiram sent a reply to Solomon, saying, "I have heard your message; I will do everything you want regarding the cedar and cypress timber. 









###### 9 




My servants will bring the logs down from Lebanon to the sea, and I will make them into rafts to go by sea to the place you indicate. I will break them apart there, and you can take them away. You then can meet my needs by providing my household with food." 









###### 10 




So Hiram provided Solomon with all the cedar and cypress timber he wanted, 









###### 11 




and Solomon provided Hiram with one hundred twenty thousand bushels[^a] of wheat as food for his household and one hundred twenty thousand gallons[^b] of oil from crushed olives. Solomon did this for Hiram year after year. 









###### 12 




The Lord gave Solomon wisdom, as he had promised him. There was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and the two of them made a treaty. ## Solomon's Workforce 









###### 13 




Then King Solomon drafted forced laborers from all Israel; the labor force numbered thirty thousand men. 









###### 14 




He sent ten thousand to Lebanon each month in shifts; one month they were in Lebanon, two months they were at home. Adoniram was in charge of the forced labor. 









###### 15 




Solomon had seventy thousand porters and eighty thousand stonecutters in the mountains, 









###### 16 




not including his thirty-three hundred[^c] deputies in charge of the work. They supervised the people doing the work. 









###### 17 




The king commanded them to quarry large, costly stones to lay the foundation of the temple with dressed stones. 









###### 18 




So Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders, along with the Gebalites, quarried the stone and prepared the timber and stone for the temple's construction. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

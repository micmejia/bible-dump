# 1 Peter 3

***










###### 1 




In the same way, wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands so that, even if some disobey the word, they may be won over without a word by the way their wives live 









###### 2 




when they observe your pure, reverent lives. 









###### 3 




Don't let your beauty consist of outward things like elaborate hairstyles and wearing gold jewelry or fine clothes, 









###### 4 




but rather what is inside the heart[^a]--the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God's sight. 









###### 5 




For in the past, the holy women who put their hope in God also adorned themselves in this way, submitting to their own husbands, 









###### 6 




just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord. You have become her children when you do what is good and do not fear any intimidation. 









###### 7 




Husbands, in the same way, live with your wives in an understanding way, as with a weaker partner, showing them honor as coheirs of the grace of life, so that your prayers will not be hindered. ## Do No Evil 









###### 8 




Finally, all of you be like-minded and sympathetic, love one another, and be compassionate and humble,[^b] 









###### 9 




not paying back evil for evil or insult for insult but, on the contrary, giving a blessing, since you were called for this, so that you may inherit a blessing. 









###### 10 




For <b class="quote">the** <b class="quote">one who wants to love life** <b class="quote">and to see good days,** <b class="quote">let him keep his tongue from evil** <b class="quote">and his lips from speaking deceit,** 









###### 11 




<b class="quote">and let him turn away** <b class="quote">from evil** <b class="quote">and do what is good.** <b class="quote">Let him seek peace** <b class="quote">and pursue it,** 









###### 12 




<b class="quote">because the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous** <b class="quote">and his ears are open to their prayer.** <b class="quote">But the face of the Lord is against** <b class="quote">those who do what is evil.** ## Undeserved Suffering 









###### 13 




Who then will harm you if you are devoted to what is good? 









###### 14 




But even if you should suffer for righteousness, you are blessed. <b class="quote">Do not fear them**[^c] <b class="quote">or be intimidated,**[^d] 









###### 15 




but in your hearts regard[^e] Christ[^f] the Lord as holy, ready at any time to give a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you. 









###### 16 




Yet do this with gentleness and reverence, keeping a clear conscience, so that when you are accused,[^g] those who disparage your good conduct in Christ will be put to shame. 









###### 17 




For it is better to suffer for doing good, if that should be God's will, than for doing evil. 









###### 18 




For Christ also suffered for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring you to God. He was put to death in the flesh[^h] but made alive by the Spirit,[^i] 









###### 19 




in which[^j] he also went and made proclamation to the spirits in prison 









###### 20 




who in the past were disobedient, when God patiently waited in the days of Noah while the ark was being prepared. In it a few--that is, eight people[^k]--were saved through water. 









###### 21 




Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you (not as the removal of dirt from the body, but the pledge[^l] of a good conscience toward God) through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, 









###### 22 




who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God with angels, authorities, and powers subject to him. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

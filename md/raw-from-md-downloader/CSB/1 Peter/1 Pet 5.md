# 1 Peter 5

***










###### 1 




I exhort the elders among you as a fellow elder and witness to the sufferings of Christ, as well as one who shares in the glory about to be revealed: 









###### 2 




Shepherd God's flock among you, not overseeing[^a] out of compulsion but willingly, as God would have you;[^b] not out of greed for money but eagerly; 









###### 3 




not lording it over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock. 









###### 4 




And when the chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory. 









###### 5 




In the same way, you who are younger, be subject to the elders. All of you clothe yourselves with[^c] humility toward one another, because <b class="quote">God resists the proud** <b class="quote">but gives grace to the humble.**[^d] ## Conclusion 









###### 6 




Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, so that he may exalt you at the proper time, 









###### 7 




casting all your cares on him, because he cares about you. 









###### 8 




Be sober-minded, be alert. Your adversary the devil is prowling around like a roaring lion, looking for anyone he can devour. 









###### 9 




Resist him, firm in the faith, knowing that the same kind of sufferings are being experienced by your fellow believers throughout the world. 









###### 10 




The God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ,[^e] will himself restore, establish, strengthen, and support you after you have suffered a little while.[^f] 









###### 11 




To him be dominion[^g] forever.[^h] Amen. 









###### 12 




Through Silvanus,[^i] a faithful brother (as I consider him), I have written to you briefly in order to encourage you and to testify that this is the true grace of God. Stand firm in it! 









###### 13 




She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you greetings, as does Mark, my son. 









###### 14 




Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace to all of you who are in Christ.[^j] ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

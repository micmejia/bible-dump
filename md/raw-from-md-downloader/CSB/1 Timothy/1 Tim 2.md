# 1 Timothy 2

***










###### 1 




First of all, then, I urge that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for everyone, 









###### 2 




for kings and all those who are in authority, so that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity. 









###### 3 




This is good, and it pleases God our Savior, 









###### 4 




who wants everyone to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. 









###### 5 




For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus, 









###### 6 




who gave himself as a ransom for all, a testimony at the proper time. 









###### 7 




For this I was appointed a herald, an apostle (I am telling the truth;[^a] I am not lying), and a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth. ## Instructions to Men and Women 









###### 8 




Therefore, I want the men in every place to pray, lifting up holy hands without anger or argument. 









###### 9 




Also, the women are to dress themselves in modest clothing, with decency and good sense, not with elaborate hairstyles, gold, pearls, or expensive apparel, 









###### 10 




but with good works, as is proper for women who profess to worship God. 









###### 11 




A woman is to learn quietly with full submission. 









###### 12 




I do not allow a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; instead, she is to remain quiet. 









###### 13 




For Adam was formed first, then Eve. 









###### 14 




And Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and transgressed. 









###### 15 




But she will be saved through childbearing, if they continue in faith, love, and holiness, with good sense. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

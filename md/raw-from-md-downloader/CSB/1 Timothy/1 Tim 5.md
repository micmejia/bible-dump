# 1 Timothy 5

***










###### 1 




Don't rebuke an older man, but exhort him as a father, younger men as brothers, 









###### 2 




older women as mothers, and the younger women as sisters with all purity. ## The Support of Widows 









###### 3 




Support[^a] widows who are genuinely in need. 









###### 4 




But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them learn to practice godliness toward their own family first and to repay their parents, for this pleases God. 









###### 5 




The widow who is truly in need and left all alone has put her hope in God and continues night and day in her petitions and prayers; 









###### 6 




however, she who is self-indulgent is dead even while she lives. 









###### 7 




Command this also, so that they will be above reproach. 









###### 8 




But if anyone does not provide for his own family, especially for his own household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever. 









###### 9 




No widow is to be enrolled on the list for support unless she is at least sixty years old, has been the wife of one husband, 









###### 10 




and is well known for good works--that is, if she has brought up children, shown hospitality, washed the saints' feet, helped the afflicted, and devoted herself to every good work. 









###### 11 




But refuse to enroll younger widows, for when they are drawn away from Christ by desire, they want to marry 









###### 12 




and will therefore receive condemnation because they have renounced their original pledge. 









###### 13 




At the same time, they also learn to be idle, going from house to house; they are not only idle, but are also gossips and busybodies, saying things they shouldn't say. 









###### 14 




Therefore, I want younger women to marry, have children, manage their households, and give the adversary no opportunity to accuse us. 









###### 15 




For some have already turned away to follow Satan. 









###### 16 




If any[^b] believing woman has widows in her family, let her help them. Let the church not be burdened, so that it can help widows in genuine need. ## Honoring the Elders 









###### 17 




The elders who are good leaders are to be considered worthy of double honor,[^c] especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching. 









###### 18 




For the Scripture says: <b class="quote">Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain,**[^d] and, "The worker is worthy of his wages." 









###### 19 




Don't accept an accusation against an elder unless it is supported by two or three witnesses. 









###### 20 




Publicly rebuke those who sin, so that the rest will be afraid. 









###### 21 




I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels to observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing out of favoritism. 









###### 22 




Don't be too quick to appoint[^e] anyone as an elder, and don't share in the sins of others. Keep yourself pure. 









###### 23 




Don't continue drinking only water, but use a little wine because of your stomach and your frequent illnesses. 









###### 24 




Some people's sins are obvious, preceding them to judgment, but the sins of others surface[^f] later. 









###### 25 




Likewise, good works are obvious, and those that are not obvious cannot remain hidden. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

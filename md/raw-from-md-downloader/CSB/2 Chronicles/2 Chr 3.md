# 2 Chronicles 3

***










###### 1 




Then Solomon began to build the Lord's temple in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah where the Lord[^a] had appeared to his father David, at the site David had prepared on the threshing floor of Ornan[^b] the Jebusite. 









###### 2 




He began to build on the second day of the second month in the fourth year of his reign. 









###### 3 




These are Solomon's foundations[^c] for building God's temple: the length[^d] was ninety feet,[^e] and the width thirty feet.[^f] 









###### 4 




The portico, which was across the front extending across the width of the temple, was thirty feet wide; its height was thirty feet;[^g] he overlaid its inner surface with pure gold. 









###### 5 




The larger room[^h] he paneled with cypress wood, overlaid with fine gold, and decorated with palm trees and chains. 









###### 6 




He adorned the temple with precious stones for beauty, and the gold was the gold of Parvaim. 









###### 7 




He overlaid the temple--the beams, the thresholds, its walls and doors--with gold, and he carved cherubim on the walls. ## The Most Holy Place 









###### 8 




Then he made the most holy place; its length corresponded to the width of the temple, 30 feet, and its width was 30 feet. He overlaid it with forty-five thousand pounds[^i] of fine gold. 









###### 9 




The weight of the nails was twenty ounces[^j] of gold, and he overlaid the ceiling with gold. 









###### 10 




He made two cherubim of sculptured work, for the most holy place, and he overlaid them with gold. 









###### 11 




The overall length of the wings of the cherubim was 30 feet: the wing of one was 7½ feet,[^k] touching the wall of the room; its other wing was 7½ feet, touching the wing of the other cherub. 









###### 12 




The wing of the other[^l] cherub was 7½ feet, touching the wall of the room; its other wing was 7½ feet, reaching the wing of the other cherub. 









###### 13 




The wingspan of these cherubim was 30 feet. They stood on their feet and faced the larger room.[^m] 









###### 14 




He made the curtain of blue, purple, and crimson yarn and fine linen, and he wove cherubim into it. ## The Bronze Pillars 









###### 15 




In front of the temple he made two pillars, each 27 feet[^n] high. The capital on top of each was 7½ feet high. 









###### 16 




He had made chainwork in the inner sanctuary and also put it on top of the pillars. He made a hundred pomegranates and fastened them into the chainwork. 









###### 17 




Then he set up the pillars in front of the sanctuary, one on the right and one on the left. He named the one on the right Jachin[^o] and the one on the left Boaz.[^p] ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

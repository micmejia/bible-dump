# 2 Corinthians 2

***










###### 1 




In fact, I made up my mind about this: I would not come to you on another painful visit.[^a] 









###### 2 




For if I cause you pain, then who will cheer me other than the one being hurt by me?[^b] 









###### 3 




I wrote this very thing so that when I came I wouldn't have pain from those who ought to give me joy, because I am confident about all of you that my joy will also be yours. 









###### 4 




For I wrote to you with many tears out of an extremely troubled and anguished heart--not to cause you pain, but that you should know the abundant love I have for you. ## A Sinner Forgiven 









###### 5 




If anyone has caused pain, he has caused pain not so much to me but to some degree--not to exaggerate--to all of you. 









###### 6 




This punishment by the majority is sufficient for that person. 









###### 7 




As a result, you should instead forgive and comfort him. Otherwise, he may be overwhelmed by excessive grief. 









###### 8 




Therefore I urge you to reaffirm your love to him. 









###### 9 




I wrote for this purpose: to test your character to see if you are obedient in everything. 









###### 10 




Anyone you forgive, I do too. For what I have forgiven--if I have forgiven anything--it is for your benefit in the presence of Christ, 









###### 11 




so that we may not be taken advantage of by Satan. For we are not ignorant of his schemes. ## A Trip to Macedonia 









###### 12 




When I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ, even though the Lord opened a door for me, 









###### 13 




I had no rest in my spirit because I did not find my brother Titus. Instead, I said good-bye to them and left for Macedonia. ## A Ministry of Life or Death 









###### 14 




But thanks be to God, who always leads us in Christ's triumphal procession and through us spreads the aroma of the knowledge of him in every place. 









###### 15 




For to God we are the fragrance of Christ among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing. 









###### 16 




To some we are an aroma of death leading to death, but to others, an aroma of life leading to life. Who is adequate for these things? 









###### 17 




For we do not market the word of God for profit like so many.[^c] On the contrary, we speak with sincerity in Christ, as from God and before God. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

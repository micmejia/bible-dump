# 2 Corinthians 5

***










###### 1 




For we know that if our earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, an eternal dwelling in the heavens, not made with hands. 









###### 2 




Indeed, we groan in this tent, desiring to put on our heavenly dwelling, 









###### 3 




since, when we are clothed,[^a] we will not be found naked. 









###### 4 




Indeed, we groan while we are in this tent, burdened as we are, because we do not want to be unclothed but clothed, so that mortality may be swallowed up by life. 









###### 5 




Now the one who prepared us for this very purpose is God, who gave us the Spirit as a down payment. 









###### 6 




So we are always confident and know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord. 









###### 7 




For we walk by faith, not by sight. 









###### 8 




In fact, we are confident, and we would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the Lord. 









###### 9 




Therefore, whether we are at home or away, we make it our aim to be pleasing to him. 









###### 10 




For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each may be repaid for what he has done in the body, whether good or evil. 









###### 11 




Therefore, since we know the fear of the Lord, we try to persuade people. What we are is plain to God, and I hope it is also plain to your consciences. 









###### 12 




We are not commending ourselves to you again, but giving you an opportunity to be proud of us, so that you may have a reply for those who take pride in outward appearance rather than in the heart. 









###### 13 




For if we are out of our mind, it is for God; if we are in our right mind, it is for you. 









###### 14 




For the love of Christ compels us, since we have reached this conclusion, that one died for all, and therefore all died. 









###### 15 




And he died for all so that those who live should no longer live for themselves, but for the one who died for them and was raised. ## The Ministry of Reconciliation 









###### 16 




From now on, then, we do not know anyone from a worldly perspective.[^b] Even if we have known Christ from a worldly perspective,[^c] yet now we no longer know him in this way. 









###### 17 




Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has passed away, and see, the new has[^d] come! 









###### 18 




Everything is from God, who has reconciled us to himself through Christ and has given us the ministry of reconciliation. 









###### 19 




That is, in Christ, God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and he has committed the message of reconciliation to us. 









###### 20 




Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, since God is making his appeal through us. We plead on Christ's behalf, "Be reconciled to God." 









###### 21 




He made the one who did not know sin to be sin[^e] for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

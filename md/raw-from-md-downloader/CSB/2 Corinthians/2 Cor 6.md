# 2 Corinthians 6

***










###### 1 




Working together with him, we also appeal to you, "Don't receive the grace of God in vain." 









###### 2 




For he says: <b class="quote">At an acceptable time I listened to you,** <b class="quote">and in the day of salvation I helped you.**[^a] See, now is the acceptable time; now is the day of salvation! ## The Character of Paul's Ministry 









###### 3 




We are not giving anyone an occasion for offense, so that the ministry will not be blamed. 









###### 4 




Instead, as God's ministers, we commend ourselves in everything: by great endurance, by afflictions, by hardships, by difficulties, 









###### 5 




by beatings, by imprisonments, by riots, by labors, by sleepless nights, by times of hunger, 









###### 6 




by purity, by knowledge, by patience, by kindness, by the Holy Spirit, by sincere love, 









###### 7 




by the word of truth,[^b] by the power of God; through weapons of righteousness for the right hand and the left, 









###### 8 




through glory and dishonor, through slander and good report; regarded as deceivers, yet true; 









###### 9 




as unknown, yet recognized; as dying, yet see--we live; as being disciplined, yet not killed; 









###### 10 




as grieving, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet enriching many; as having nothing, yet possessing everything. 









###### 11 




We have spoken openly to you, Corinthians; our heart has been opened wide. 









###### 12 




We are not withholding our affection from you, but you are withholding yours from us. 









###### 13 




I speak as to my children; as a proper response, open your heart to us. ## Separation to God 









###### 14 




Do not be yoked together with those who do not believe. For what partnership is there between righteousness and lawlessness? Or what fellowship does light have with darkness? 









###### 15 




What agreement does Christ have with Belial?[^c] Or what does a believer have in common with an unbeliever? 









###### 16 




And what agreement does the temple of God have with idols? For we[^d] are the temple of the living God, as God said: <b class="quote">I will dwell** <b class="quote">and walk among them,** <b class="quote">and I will be their God,** <b class="quote">and they will be my people.**[^e] 









###### 17 




<b class="quote">Therefore, come out from among them** <b class="quote">and be separate, says the Lord;** <b class="quote">do not touch any unclean thing,** <b class="quote">and I will welcome you.**[^f] 









###### 18 




<b class="quote">And I will be a Father** <b class="quote">to you,** <b class="quote">and you will be sons** <b class="quote">and daughters to me,** <b class="quote">says the Lord Almighty.**[^g] ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

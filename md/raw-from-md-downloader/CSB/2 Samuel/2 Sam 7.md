# 2 Samuel 7

***










###### 1 




When the king had settled into his palace and the Lord had given him rest on every side from all his enemies, 









###### 2 




the king said to the prophet Nathan, "Look, I am living in a cedar house while the ark of God sits inside tent curtains." 









###### 3 




So Nathan told the king, "Go and do all that is on your mind, for the Lord is with you." 









###### 4 




But that night the word of the Lord came to Nathan: 









###### 5 




"Go to my servant David and say, 'This is what the Lord says: Are you to build me a house to dwell in? 









###### 6 




From the time I brought the Israelites out of Egypt until today I have not dwelt in a house; instead, I have been moving around with a tent as my dwelling. 









###### 7 




In all my journeys with all the Israelites, have I ever spoken a word to one of the tribal leaders of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd my people Israel, asking: Why haven't you built me a house of cedar?' 









###### 8 




"So now this is what you are to say to my servant David: 'This is what the Lord of Armies says: I took you from the pasture, from tending the flock, to be ruler over my people Israel. 









###### 9 




I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have destroyed all your enemies before you. I will make a great name for you like that of the greatest on the earth. 









###### 10 




I will designate a place for my people Israel and plant them, so that they may live there and not be disturbed again. Evildoers will not continue to oppress them as they have done 









###### 11 




ever since the day I ordered judges to be over my people Israel. I will give you rest from all your enemies. "'The Lord declares to you: The Lord himself will make a house for you. 









###### 12 




When your time comes and you rest with your ancestors, I will raise up after you your descendant, who will come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom. 









###### 13 




He is the one who will build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. 









###### 14 




I will be his father, and he will be my son. When he does wrong, I will discipline him with a rod of men and blows from mortals. 









###### 15 




But my faithful love will never leave him as it did when I removed it from Saul, whom I removed from before you. 









###### 16 




Your house and kingdom will endure before me[^a] forever, and your throne will be established forever.'" 









###### 17 




Nathan reported all these words and this entire vision to David. ## David's Prayer of Thanksgiving 









###### 18 




Then King David went in, sat in the Lord's presence, and said, Who am I, Lord God, and what is my house that you have brought me this far? 









###### 19 




What you have done so far[^b] was a little thing to you, Lord God, for you have also spoken about your servant's house in the distant future. And this is a revelation[^c] for mankind, Lord God. 









###### 20 




What more can David say to you? You know your servant, Lord God. 









###### 21 




Because of your word and according to your will, you have revealed all these great things to your servant. 









###### 22 




This is why you are great, Lord God. There is no one like you, and there is no God besides you, as all we have heard confirms. 









###### 23 




And who is like your people Israel? God came to one nation on earth in order to redeem a people for himself, to make a name for himself, and to perform for them[^d] great and awesome acts,[^e] driving out nations and their gods before your people you redeemed for yourself from Egypt. 









###### 24 




You established your people Israel to be your own people forever, and you, Lord, have become their God. 









###### 25 




Now, Lord God, fulfill the promise forever that you have made to your servant and his house. Do as you have promised, 









###### 26 




so that your name will be exalted forever, when it is said, "The Lord of Armies is God over Israel." The house of your servant David will be established before you 









###### 27 




since you, Lord of Armies, God of Israel, have revealed this to your servant when you said, "I will build a house for you." Therefore, your servant has found the courage to pray this prayer to you. 









###### 28 




Lord God, you are God; your words are true, and you have promised this good thing to your servant. 









###### 29 




Now, please bless your servant's house so that it will continue before you forever. For you, Lord God, have spoken, and with your blessing your servant's house will be blessed forever. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

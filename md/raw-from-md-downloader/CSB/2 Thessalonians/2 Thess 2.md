# 2 Thessalonians 2

***










###### 1 




Now concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered to him: We ask you, brothers and sisters, 









###### 2 




not to be easily upset or troubled, either by a prophecy[^a] or by a message or by a letter supposedly from us, alleging that the day of the Lord[^b] has come. 









###### 3 




Don't let anyone deceive you in any way. For that day will not come unless the apostasy[^c] comes first and the man of lawlessness[^d] is revealed, the man doomed to destruction. 









###### 4 




He opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god or object of worship, so that he sits[^e] in God's temple, proclaiming that he himself is God. 









###### 5 




Don't you remember that when I was still with you I used to tell you about this? 









###### 6 




And you know what currently restrains him, so that he will be revealed in his time. 









###### 7 




For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work, but the one now restraining will do so until he is out of the way, 









###### 8 




and then the lawless one will be revealed. The Lord Jesus will destroy him with the breath of his mouth and will bring him to nothing at the appearance of his coming. 









###### 9 




The coming of the lawless one is based on Satan's working, with every kind of miracle, both signs and wonders serving the lie, 









###### 10 




and with every wicked deception among those who are perishing. They perish because they did not accept the love of the truth and so be saved. 









###### 11 




For this reason God sends them a strong delusion so that they will believe the lie, 









###### 12 




so that all will be condemned--those who did not believe the truth but delighted in unrighteousness. ## Stand Firm 









###### 13 




But we ought to thank God always for you, brothers and sisters loved by the Lord, because from the beginning[^f] God has chosen you for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and through belief in the truth. 









###### 14 




He called you to this through our gospel, so that you might obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. 









###### 15 




So then, brothers and sisters, stand firm and hold to the traditions you were taught, whether by what we said or what we wrote. 









###### 16 




May our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who has loved us and given us eternal encouragement and good hope by grace, 









###### 17 




encourage your hearts and strengthen you in every good work and word. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# 2 Thessalonians 3

***










###### 1 




In addition, brothers and sisters, pray for us that the word of the Lord may spread rapidly and be honored, just as it was with you, 









###### 2 




and that we may be delivered from wicked and evil people, for not all have faith.[^a] 









###### 3 




But the Lord is faithful; he will strengthen you and guard you from the evil one. 









###### 4 




We have confidence in the Lord about you, that you are doing and will continue to do what we command. 









###### 5 




May the Lord direct your hearts to God's love and Christ's endurance. ## Warning against Irresponsible Behavior 









###### 6 




Now we command you, brothers and sisters, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to keep away from every brother or sister who is idle and does not live[^b] according to the tradition received from us. 









###### 7 




For you yourselves know how you should imitate us: We were not idle among you; 









###### 8 




we did not eat anyone's food free of charge; instead, we labored and toiled, working night and day, so that we would not be a burden to any of you. 









###### 9 




It is not that we don't have the right to support, but we did it to make ourselves an example to you so that you would imitate us. 









###### 10 




In fact, when we were with you, this is what we commanded you: "If anyone isn't willing to work, he should not eat." 









###### 11 




For we hear that there are some among you who are idle. They are not busy but busybodies. 









###### 12 




Now we command and exhort such people by the Lord Jesus Christ to work quietly and provide for themselves.[^c] 









###### 13 




But as for you, brothers and sisters, do not grow weary in doing good. 









###### 14 




If anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter, take note of that person; don't associate with him, so that he may be ashamed. 









###### 15 




Yet don't consider him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother. ## Final Greetings 









###### 16 




May the Lord of peace himself give you peace always in every way. The Lord be with all of you. 









###### 17 




I, Paul, am writing this greeting with my own hand, which is an authenticating mark in every letter; this is how I write. 









###### 18 




The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# 2 Timothy 2

***










###### 1 




You, therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. 









###### 2 




What you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses, commit to faithful men[^a] who will be able to teach others also. 









###### 3 




Share in suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. 









###### 4 




No one serving as a soldier gets entangled in the concerns of civilian life; he seeks to please the commanding officer. 









###### 5 




Also, if anyone competes as an athlete, he is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules. 









###### 6 




The hardworking farmer ought to be the first to get a share of the crops. 









###### 7 




Consider what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything. 









###### 8 




Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead and descended from David, according to my gospel, 









###### 9 




for which I suffer to the point of being bound like a criminal. But the word of God is not bound. 









###### 10 




This is why I endure all things for the elect: so that they also may obtain salvation, which is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory. 









###### 11 




This saying is trustworthy: For if we died with him, we will also live with him; 









###### 12 




if we endure, we will also reign with him; if we deny him, he will also deny us; 









###### 13 




if we are faithless, he remains faithful, for he cannot deny himself. ## An Approved Worker 









###### 14 




Remind them of these things, and charge them before God[^b] not to fight about words. This is useless and leads to the ruin of those who listen. 









###### 15 




Be diligent to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who doesn't need to be ashamed, correctly teaching the word of truth. 









###### 16 




Avoid irreverent and empty speech, since those who engage in it will produce even more godlessness, 









###### 17 




and their teaching will spread like gangrene. Hymenaeus and Philetus are among them. 









###### 18 




They have departed from the truth, saying that the resurrection has already taken place, and are ruining the faith of some. 









###### 19 




Nevertheless, God's solid foundation stands firm, bearing this inscription: <b class="quote">The Lord knows those who are his,**[^c] and let everyone who calls on the name of[^d] the Lord turn away from wickedness. 









###### 20 




Now in a large house there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also those of wood and clay; some for honorable[^e] use and some for dishonorable.[^f] 









###### 21 




So if anyone purifies himself from anything dishonorable,[^g] he will be a special[^h] instrument, set apart, useful to the Master, prepared for every good work. 









###### 22 




Flee from youthful passions, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart. 









###### 23 




But reject foolish and ignorant disputes, because you know that they breed quarrels. 









###### 24 




The Lord's servant must not quarrel, but must be gentle to everyone, able to teach,[^i] and patient, 









###### 25 




instructing his opponents with gentleness. Perhaps God will grant them repentance leading them to the knowledge of the truth. 









###### 26 




Then they may come to their senses and escape the trap of the devil, who has taken them captive to do his will. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

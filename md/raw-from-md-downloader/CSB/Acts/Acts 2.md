# Acts 2

***










###### 1 




When the day of Pentecost had arrived, they were all together in one place. 









###### 2 




Suddenly a sound like that of a violent rushing wind came from heaven, and it filled the whole house where they were staying. 









###### 3 




They saw tongues like flames of fire that separated and rested on each one of them. 









###### 4 




Then they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in different tongues,[^a] as the Spirit enabled them. 









###### 5 




Now there were Jews staying in Jerusalem, devout people from every nation under heaven. 









###### 6 




When this sound occurred, a crowd came together and was confused because each one heard them speaking in his own language. 









###### 7 




They were astounded and amazed, saying,[^b] "Look, aren't all these who are speaking Galileans? 









###### 8 




How is it that each of us can hear them in our own native language? 









###### 9 




Parthians, Medes, Elamites; those who live in Mesopotamia, in Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, 









###### 10 




Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene; visitors from Rome (both Jews and converts), 









###### 11 




Cretans and Arabs--we hear them declaring the magnificent acts of God in our own tongues." 









###### 12 




They were all astounded and perplexed, saying to one another, "What does this mean?" 









###### 13 




But some sneered and said, "They're drunk on new wine." ## Peter's Sermon 









###### 14 




Peter stood up with the Eleven, raised his voice, and proclaimed to them, "Fellow Jews and all you residents of Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and pay attention to my words. 









###### 15 




For these people are not drunk, as you suppose, since it's only nine in the morning.[^c] 









###### 16 




On the contrary, this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel: 









###### 17 




<b class="quote">And it will be** in the last days, says God, that <b class="quote">I will pour out my Spirit on all people;** <b class="quote">then your sons and your daughters will prophesy,** <b class="quote">your young men will see visions,** <b class="quote">and your old men will dream dreams.** 









###### 18 




<b class="quote">I will even pour out my Spirit** <b class="quote">on my servants in those days, both men and women** and they will prophesy. 









###### 19 




<b class="quote">I will display wonders in the heaven** above <b class="quote">and signs on the earth** below: <b class="quote">blood and fire and a cloud of smoke.** 









###### 20 




<b class="quote">The sun will be turned to darkness** <b class="quote">and the moon to blood** <b class="quote">before the great and glorious day of the Lord** <b class="quote">comes.** 









###### 21 




<b class="quote">Then everyone who calls** <b class="quote">on the name of the Lord will be saved.**[^d] 









###### 22 




"Fellow Israelites, listen to these words: This Jesus of Nazareth was a man attested to you by God with miracles, wonders, and signs that God did among you through him, just as you yourselves know. 









###### 23 




Though he was delivered up according to God's determined plan and foreknowledge, you used[^e] lawless people to nail him to a cross and kill him. 









###### 24 




God raised him up, ending the pains of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by death. 









###### 25 




For David says of him: <b class="quote">I saw the Lord ever before me;** <b class="quote">because he is at my right hand,** <b class="quote">I will not be shaken.** 









###### 26 




<b class="quote">Therefore my heart is glad** <b class="quote">and my tongue rejoices.** <b class="quote">Moreover, my flesh will rest in hope,** 









###### 27 




<b class="quote">because you will not abandon me in Hades** <b class="quote">or allow your holy one to see decay.** 









###### 28 




<b class="quote">You have revealed the paths of life to me;** <b class="quote">you will fill me with gladness** <b class="quote">in your presence.**[^f] 









###### 29 




"Brothers and sisters, I can confidently speak to you about the patriarch David: He is both dead and buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. 









###### 30 




Since he was a prophet, he knew that God had sworn an oath to him to seat one of his descendants[^g] on his throne. 









###### 31 




Seeing what was to come, he spoke concerning the resurrection of the Messiah: <b class="quote">He**[^h] <b class="quote">was not abandoned in Hades, and** his flesh <b class="quote">did not experience decay.**[^i] 









###### 32 




"God has raised this Jesus; we are all witnesses of this. 









###### 33 




Therefore, since he has been exalted to the right hand of God and has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit, he has poured out what you both see and hear. 









###### 34 




For it was not David who ascended into the heavens, but he himself says: <b class="quote">The Lord declared to my Lord,** <b class="quote">'Sit at my right hand** 









###### 35 




<b class="quote">until I make your enemies your footstool.'**[^j] 









###### 36 




"Therefore let all the house of Israel know with certainty that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Messiah." ## Call to Repentance 









###### 37 




When they heard this, they were pierced to the heart and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, "Brothers, what should we do?" 









###### 38 




Peter replied, "Repent and be baptized, each of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. 









###### 39 




For the promise is for you and for your children, and for all who are far off, as many as the Lord our God will call." 









###### 40 




With many other words he testified and strongly urged them, saying, "Be saved from this corrupt[^k] generation!" 









###### 41 




So those who accepted his message were baptized, and that day about three thousand people were added to them. ## A Generous and Growing Church 









###### 42 




They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching, to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread, and to prayer. 









###### 43 




Everyone was filled with awe, and many wonders and signs were being performed through the apostles. 









###### 44 




Now all the believers were together and held all things in common. 









###### 45 




They sold their possessions and property and distributed the proceeds to all, as any had need. 









###### 46 




Every day they devoted themselves to meeting together in the temple, and broke bread from house to house. They ate their food with joyful and sincere hearts, 









###### 47 




praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. Every day the Lord added to their number[^l] those who were being saved. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

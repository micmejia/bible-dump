# Amos 3

***










###### 1 




Listen to this message that the Lord has spoken against you, Israelites, against the entire clan that I brought from the land of Egypt: 









###### 2 




I have known only you out of all the clans of the earth; therefore, I will punish you for all your iniquities. 









###### 3 




Can two walk together without agreeing to meet? 









###### 4 




Does a lion roar in the forest when it has no prey? Does a young lion growl from its lair unless it has captured something? 









###### 5 




Does a bird land in a trap on the ground if there is no bait for it? Does a trap spring from the ground when it has caught nothing? 









###### 6 




If a ram's horn is blown in a city, aren't people afraid? If a disaster occurs in a city, hasn't the Lord done it? 









###### 7 




Indeed, the Lord God does nothing without revealing his counsel to his servants the prophets. 









###### 8 




A lion has roared; who will not fear? The Lord God has spoken; who will not prophesy? 









###### 9 




Proclaim on the citadels in Ashdod and on the citadels in the land of Egypt: Assemble on the mountains of Samaria, and see the great turmoil in the city and the acts of oppression within it. 









###### 10 




The people are incapable of doing right-- this is the Lord's declaration-- those who store up violence and destruction in their citadels. 









###### 11 




Therefore, the Lord God says: An enemy will surround the land; he will destroy your strongholds and plunder your citadels. 









###### 12 




The Lord says: As the shepherd snatches two legs or a piece of an ear from the lion's mouth, so the Israelites who live in Samaria will be rescued with only the corner of a bed or the[^a] cushion[^b] of a couch.[^c] 









###### 13 




Listen and testify against the house of Jacob-- this is the declaration of the Lord God, the God of Armies. 









###### 14 




I will punish the altars of Bethel on the day I punish Israel for its crimes; the horns of the altar will be cut off and fall to the ground. 









###### 15 




I will demolish the winter house and the summer house; the houses inlaid with ivory will be destroyed, and the great houses will come to an end. This is the Lord's declaration. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

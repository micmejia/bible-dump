# Amos 4

***










###### 1 




Listen to this message, you cows of Bashan who are on the hill of Samaria, women who oppress the poor and crush the needy, who say to their husbands, "Bring us something to drink." 









###### 2 




The Lord God has sworn by his holiness: Look, the days are coming[^a] when you will be taken away with hooks, every last one of you with fishhooks. 









###### 3 




You will go through breaches in the wall, each woman straight ahead, and you will be driven along toward Harmon. This is the Lord's declaration. 









###### 4 




Come to Bethel and rebel; rebel even more at Gilgal! Bring your sacrifices every morning, your tenths every three days. 









###### 5 




Offer leavened bread as a thanksgiving sacrifice, and loudly proclaim your freewill offerings, for that is what you Israelites love to do! This is the declaration of the Lord God. ## God's Discipline and Israel's Apostasy 









###### 6 




I gave you absolutely nothing to eat[^b] in all your cities, a shortage of food in all your communities, yet you did not return to me. This is the Lord's declaration. 









###### 7 




I also withheld the rain from you while there were still three months until harvest. I sent rain on one city but no rain on another. One field received rain while a field with no rain withered. 









###### 8 




Two or three cities staggered to another city to drink water but were not satisfied, yet you did not return to me. This is the Lord's declaration. 









###### 9 




I struck you with blight and mildew; the locust devoured your many gardens and vineyards, your fig trees and olive trees, yet you did not return to me. This is the Lord's declaration. 









###### 10 




I sent plagues like those of Egypt; I killed your young men with the sword, along with your captured horses. I caused the stench of your camp to fill your nostrils, yet you did not return to me. This is the Lord's declaration. 









###### 11 




I overthrew some of you as I[^c] overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and you were like a burning stick snatched from a fire, yet you did not return to me-- This is the Lord's declaration. 









###### 12 




Therefore, Israel, that is what I will do to you, and since I will do that to you, Israel, prepare to meet your God! 









###### 13 




He is here: the one who forms the mountains, creates the wind, and reveals his thoughts to man, the one who makes the dawn out of darkness and strides on the heights of the earth. The Lord, the God of Armies, is his name. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

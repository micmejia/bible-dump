# Amos 5

***










###### 1 




Listen to this message that I am singing for you, a lament, house of Israel: 









###### 2 




She has fallen; Virgin Israel will never rise again. She lies abandoned on her land with no one to raise her up. 









###### 3 




For the Lord God says: The city that marches out a thousand strong will have only a hundred left, and the one that marches out a hundred strong will have only ten left in the house of Israel. ## Seek God and Live 









###### 4 




For the Lord says to the house of Israel: Seek me and live! 









###### 5 




Do not seek Bethel or go to Gilgal or journey to Beer-sheba, for Gilgal will certainly go into exile, and Bethel will come to nothing. 









###### 6 




Seek the Lord and live, or he will spread like fire throughout the house of Joseph; it will consume everything with no one at Bethel to extinguish it. 









###### 7 




Those who turn justice into wormwood also throw righteousness to the ground. 









###### 8 




The one who made the Pleiades and Orion, who turns darkness[^a] into dawn and darkens day into night, who summons the water of the sea and pours it out over the surface of the earth-- the Lord is his name. 









###### 9 




He brings destruction[^b] on the strong,[^c] and it falls on the fortress. 









###### 10 




They hate the one who convicts the guilty at the city gate, and they despise the one who speaks with integrity. 









###### 11 




Therefore, because you trample on the poor and exact a grain tax from him, you will never live in the houses of cut stone you have built; you will never drink the wine from the lush vineyards you have planted. 









###### 12 




For I know your crimes are many and your sins innumerable. They oppress the righteous, take a bribe, and deprive the poor of justice at the city gates. 









###### 13 




Therefore, those who have insight will keep silent[^d] at such a time, for the days are evil. 









###### 14 




Pursue good and not evil so that you may live, and the Lord, the God of Armies, will be with you as you have claimed. 









###### 15 




Hate evil and love good; establish justice at the city gate. Perhaps the Lord, the God of Armies, will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph. 









###### 16 




Therefore the Lord, the God of Armies, the Lord, says: There will be wailing in all the public squares; they will cry out in anguish[^e] in all the streets. The farmer will be called on to mourn, and professional mourners[^f] to wail. 









###### 17 




There will be wailing in all the vineyards, for I will pass among you. The Lord has spoken. ## The Day of the Lord 









###### 18 




Woe to you who long for the day of the Lord! What will the day of the Lord be for you? It will be darkness and not light. 









###### 19 




It will be like a man who flees from a lion only to have a bear confront him. He goes home and rests his hand against the wall only to have a snake bite him. 









###### 20 




Won't the day of the Lord be darkness rather than light, even gloom without any brightness in it? 









###### 21 




I hate, I despise, your feasts! I can't stand the stench of your solemn assemblies. 









###### 22 




Even if you offer me your burnt offerings and grain offerings, I will not accept them; I will have no regard for your fellowship offerings of fattened cattle. 









###### 23 




Take away from me the noise of your songs! I will not listen to the music of your harps. 









###### 24 




But let justice flow like water, and righteousness, like an unfailing stream. 









###### 25 




"House of Israel, was it sacrifices and grain offerings that you presented to me during the forty years in the wilderness? 









###### 26 




But you have taken up[^g] Sakkuth your king and Kaiwan your star god,[^h] images you have made for yourselves. 









###### 27 




So I will send you into exile beyond Damascus." The Lord, the God of Armies, is his name. He has spoken. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

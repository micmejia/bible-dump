# Amos 6

***










###### 1 




Woe to those who are at ease in Zion and to those who feel secure on the hill of Samaria-- the notable people in this first of the nations, those the house of Israel comes to. 









###### 2 




Cross over to Calneh and see; go from there to great Hamath; then go down to Gath of the Philistines. Are you better than these kingdoms? Is their territory larger than yours? 









###### 3 




You dismiss any thought of the evil day and bring in a reign of violence. 









###### 4 




They lie on beds inlaid with ivory, sprawled out on their couches, and dine on lambs from the flock and calves from the stall. 









###### 5 




They improvise songs[^a] to the sound of the harp and invent[^b] their own musical instruments like David. 









###### 6 




They drink wine by the bowlful and anoint themselves with the finest oils but do not grieve over the ruin of Joseph. 









###### 7 




Therefore, they will now go into exile as the first of the captives, and the feasting of those who sprawl out will come to an end. ## Israel's Pride Judged 









###### 8 




The Lord God has sworn by himself--this is the declaration of the Lord, the God of Armies: I loathe Jacob's pride and hate his citadels, so I will hand over the city and everything in it. 









###### 9 




And if there are ten men left in one house, they will die. 









###### 10 




A close relative[^c] and burner[^d] will remove his corpse[^e] from the house. He will call to someone in the inner recesses of the house, "Any more with you?" That person will reply, "None." Then he will say, "Silence, because the Lord's name must not be invoked." 









###### 11 




For the Lord commands: The large house will be smashed to pieces, and the small house to rubble. 









###### 12 




Do horses gallop on the cliffs? Does anyone plow there with oxen?[^f] Yet you have turned justice into poison and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood-- 









###### 13 




you who rejoice over Lo-debar and say, "Didn't we capture Karnaim for ourselves by our own strength?" 









###### 14 




But look, I am raising up a nation against you, house of Israel-- this is the declaration of the Lord, the God of Armies-- and they will oppress you from the entrance of Hamath[^g] to the Brook of the Arabah.[^h] ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

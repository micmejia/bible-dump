# Amos 8

***










###### 1 




The Lord God showed me this: a basket of summer fruit. 









###### 2 




He asked me, "What do you see, Amos?" I replied, "A basket of summer fruit."[^a] The Lord said to me, "The end has come for my people Israel; I will no longer spare them. 









###### 3 




In that day the temple[^b] songs will become wailing"--this is the Lord God's declaration. "Many dead bodies, thrown everywhere! Silence!" 









###### 4 




Hear this, you who trample on the needy and do away with the poor of the land, 









###### 5 




asking, "When will the New Moon be over so we may sell grain, and the Sabbath, so we may market wheat? We can reduce the measure while increasing the price[^c] and cheat with dishonest scales. 









###### 6 




We can buy the poor with silver and the needy for a pair of sandals and even sell the chaff!" 









###### 7 




The Lord has sworn by the Pride of Jacob:[^d] I will never forget all their deeds. 









###### 8 




Because of this, won't the land quake and all who dwell in it mourn? All of it will rise like the Nile; it will surge and then subside like the Nile in Egypt. 









###### 9 




And in that day-- this is the declaration of the Lord God-- I will make the sun go down at noon; I will darken the land in the daytime. 









###### 10 




I will turn your feasts into mourning and all your songs into lamentation; I will cause everyone[^e] to wear sackcloth and every head to be shaved. I will make that grief like mourning for an only son and its outcome like a bitter day. 









###### 11 




Look, the days are coming-- this is the declaration of the Lord God-- when I will send a famine through the land: not a famine of bread or a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord. 









###### 12 




People will stagger from sea to sea and roam from north to east seeking the word of the Lord, but they will not find it. 









###### 13 




In that day the beautiful young women, the young men also, will faint from thirst. 









###### 14 




Those who swear by the guilt of Samaria and say, "As your god lives, Dan," or, "As the way[^f][^g] of Beer-sheba lives"-- they will fall, never to rise again. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

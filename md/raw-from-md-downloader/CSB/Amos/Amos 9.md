# Amos 9

***










###### 1 




I saw the Lord standing beside the altar, and he said: Strike the capitals of the pillars so that the thresholds shake; knock them down on the heads of all the people. Then I will kill the rest of them with the sword. None of those who flee will get away; none of the fugitives will escape. 









###### 2 




If they dig down to Sheol, from there my hand will take them; if they climb up to heaven, from there I will bring them down. 









###### 3 




If they hide on the top of Carmel, from there I will track them down and seize them; if they conceal themselves from my sight on the sea floor, from there I will command the sea serpent to bite them. 









###### 4 




And if they are driven by their enemies into captivity, from there I will command the sword to kill them. I will keep my eye on them for harm and not for good. 









###### 5 




The Lord, the God of Armies-- he touches the earth; it melts, and all who dwell in it mourn; all of it rises like the Nile and subsides like the Nile of Egypt. 









###### 6 




He builds his upper chambers in the heavens and lays the foundation of his vault on the earth. He summons the water of the sea and pours it out over the surface of the earth. The Lord is his name. ## Announcement of Judgment 









###### 7 




Israelites, are you not like the Cushites to me? This is the Lord's declaration. Didn't I bring Israel from the land of Egypt, the Philistines from Caphtor,[^a] and the Arameans from Kir? 









###### 8 




Look, the eyes of the Lord God are on the sinful kingdom, and I will obliterate it from the face of the earth. However, I will not totally destroy the house of Jacob-- this is the Lord's declaration-- 









###### 9 




for I am about to give the command, and I will shake the house of Israel among all the nations, as one shakes a sieve, but not a pebble will fall to the ground. 









###### 10 




All the sinners among my people who say, "Disaster will never overtake[^b] or confront us," will die by the sword. ## Announcement of Restoration 









###### 11 




In that day I will restore the fallen shelter of David: I will repair its gaps, restore its ruins, and rebuild it as in the days of old, 









###### 12 




so that they may possess the remnant of Edom and all the nations that bear my name[^c]-- this is the declaration of the Lord; he will do this. 









###### 13 




Look, the days are coming-- this is the Lord's declaration-- when the plowman will overtake the reaper and the one who treads grapes, the sower of seed. The mountains will drip with sweet wine, and all the hills will flow with it. 









###### 14 




I will restore the fortunes of my people Israel.[^d] They will rebuild and occupy ruined cities, plant vineyards and drink their wine, make gardens and eat their produce. 









###### 15 




I will plant them on their land, and they will never again be uprooted from the land I have given them. The Lord your God has spoken. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

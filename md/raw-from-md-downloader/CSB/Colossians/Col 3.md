# Colossians 3

***










###### 1 




So if you have been raised with Christ, seek the things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. 









###### 2 




Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things. 









###### 3 




For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. 









###### 4 




When Christ, who is your[^a] life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory. 









###### 5 




Therefore, put to death what belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desire, and greed, which is idolatry. 









###### 6 




Because of these, God's wrath is coming upon the disobedient,[^b] 









###### 7 




and you once walked in these things when you were living in them. 









###### 8 




But now, put away all the following: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and filthy language from your mouth. 









###### 9 




Do not lie to one another, since you have put off the old self with its practices 









###### 10 




and have put on the new self. You are being renewed in knowledge according to the image of your[^c] Creator. 









###### 11 




In Christ there is not Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave and free; but Christ is all and in all. ## The Christian Life 









###### 12 




Therefore, as God's chosen ones, holy and dearly loved, put on compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience, 









###### 13 




bearing with one another and forgiving one another if anyone has a grievance against another. Just as the Lord has forgiven you, so you are also to forgive. 









###### 14 




Above all, put on love, which is the perfect bond of unity. 









###### 15 




And let the peace of Christ, to which you were also called in one body, rule your hearts. And be thankful. 









###### 16 




Let the word of Christ dwell richly among you, in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another through psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs,[^d] singing to God with gratitude in your hearts. 









###### 17 




And whatever you do, in word or in deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him. ## Christ in Your Home 









###### 18 




Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. 









###### 19 




Husbands, love your wives and don't be bitter toward them. 









###### 20 




Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord. 









###### 21 




Fathers, do not exasperate your children, so that they won't become discouraged. 









###### 22 




Slaves, obey your human masters in everything. Don't work only while being watched, as people-pleasers, but work wholeheartedly, fearing the Lord. 









###### 23 




Whatever you do, do it from the heart, as something done for the Lord and not for people, 









###### 24 




knowing that you will receive the reward of an inheritance from the Lord. You serve the Lord Christ. 









###### 25 




For the wrongdoer will be paid back for whatever wrong he has done, and there is no favoritism. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

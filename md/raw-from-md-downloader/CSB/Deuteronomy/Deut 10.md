# Deuteronomy 10

***










###### 1 




"The Lord said to me at that time, 'Cut two stone tablets like the first ones and come to me on the mountain and make a wooden ark. 









###### 2 




I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets you broke, and you are to place them in the ark.' 









###### 3 




So I made an ark of acacia wood, cut two stone tablets like the first ones, and climbed the mountain with the two tablets in my hand. 









###### 4 




Then on the day of the assembly, the Lord wrote on the tablets what had been written previously, the Ten Commandments that he had spoken to you on the mountain from the fire. The Lord gave them to me, 









###### 5 




and I went back down the mountain and placed the tablets in the ark I had made. And they have remained there, as the Lord commanded me." 









###### 6 




The Israelites traveled from Beeroth Bene-jaakan[^a] to Moserah. Aaron died and was buried there, and Eleazar his son became priest in his place. 









###### 7 




They traveled from there to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land with flowing streams. 









###### 8 




"At that time the Lord set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the Lord's covenant, to stand before the Lord to serve him, and to pronounce blessings in his name, as it is today. 









###### 9 




For this reason, Levi does not have a portion or inheritance like his brothers; the Lord is his inheritance, as the Lord your God told him. 









###### 10 




"I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights like the first time. The Lord also listened to me on this occasion; he agreed not to annihilate you. 









###### 11 




Then the Lord said to me, 'Get up. Continue your journey ahead of the people, so that they may enter and possess the land I swore to give their ancestors.' ## What God Requires 









###### 12 




"And now, Israel, what does the Lord your God ask of you except to fear the Lord your God by walking in all his ways, to love him, and to worship the Lord your God with all your heart and all your soul? 









###### 13 




Keep the Lord's commands and statutes I am giving you today, for your own good. 









###### 14 




The heavens, indeed the highest heavens, belong to the Lord your God, as does the earth and everything in it. 









###### 15 




Yet the Lord had his heart set on your ancestors and loved them. He chose their descendants after them--he chose you out of all the peoples, as it is today. 









###### 16 




Therefore, circumcise your hearts and don't be stiff-necked any longer. 









###### 17 




For the Lord your God is the God of gods and Lord of lords, the great, mighty, and awe-inspiring God, showing no partiality and taking no bribe. 









###### 18 




He executes justice for the fatherless and the widow, and loves the resident alien, giving him food and clothing. 









###### 19 




You are also to love the resident alien, since you were resident aliens in the land of Egypt. 









###### 20 




You are to fear the Lord your God and worship him. Remain faithful[^b] to him and take oaths in his name. 









###### 21 




He is your praise and he is your God, who has done for you these great and awe-inspiring works your eyes have seen. 









###### 22 




Your ancestors went down to Egypt, seventy people in all, and now the Lord your God has made you numerous, like the stars of the sky. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

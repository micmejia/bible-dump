# Deuteronomy 19

***










###### 1 




"When the Lord your God annihilates the nations whose land he is giving you, so that you drive them out and live in their cities and houses, 









###### 2 




you are to set apart three cities for yourselves within the land the Lord your God is giving you to possess. 









###### 3 




You are to determine the distances[^a] and divide the land the Lord your God is granting you as an inheritance into three regions, so that anyone who commits manslaughter can flee to these cities.[^b] 









###### 4 




"Here is the law concerning a case of someone who kills a person and flees there to save his life, having killed his neighbor accidentally without previously hating him: 









###### 5 




If, for example, he goes into the forest with his neighbor to cut timber, and his hand swings the ax to chop down a tree, but the blade flies off the handle and strikes his neighbor so that he dies, that person may flee to one of these cities and live. 









###### 6 




Otherwise, the avenger of blood in the heat of his anger[^c] might pursue the one who committed manslaughter, overtake him because the distance is great, and strike him dead. Yet he did not deserve to die,[^d] since he did not previously hate his neighbor. 









###### 7 




This is why I am commanding you to set apart three cities for yourselves. 









###### 8 




If the Lord your God enlarges your territory as he swore to your ancestors, and gives you all the land he promised to give them-- 









###### 9 




provided you keep every one of these commands I am giving you today and follow them, loving the Lord your God and walking in his ways at all times--you are to add three more cities to these three. 









###### 10 




In this way, innocent blood will not be shed, and you will not become guilty of bloodshed in the land the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance. 









###### 11 




But if someone hates his neighbor, lies in ambush for him, attacks him, and strikes him fatally, and flees to one of these cities, 









###### 12 




the elders of his city are to send for him, take him from there, and hand him over to the avenger of blood and he will die. 









###### 13 




Do not look on him with pity but purge from Israel the guilt of shedding innocent blood, and you will prosper. ## Boundary Markers 









###### 14 




"Do not move your neighbor's boundary marker, established at the start in the inheritance you will receive in the land the Lord your God is giving you to possess. ## Witnesses in Court 









###### 15 




"One witness cannot establish any iniquity or sin against a person, whatever that person has done. A fact must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses. 









###### 16 




"If a malicious witness testifies against someone accusing him of a crime, 









###### 17 




the two people in the dispute are to stand in the presence of the Lord before the priests and judges in authority at that time. 









###### 18 




The judges are to make a careful investigation, and if the witness turns out to be a liar who has falsely accused his brother, 









###### 19 




you must do to him as he intended to do to his brother. You must purge the evil from you. 









###### 20 




Then everyone else will hear and be afraid, and they will never again do anything evil like this among you. 









###### 21 




Do not show pity: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, and foot for foot. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

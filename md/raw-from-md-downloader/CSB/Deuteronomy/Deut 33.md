# Deuteronomy 33

***










###### 1 




This is the blessing that Moses, the man of God, gave the Israelites before his death. 









###### 2 




He said: The Lord came from Sinai and appeared to them from Seir; he shone on them from Mount Paran and came with ten thousand holy ones,[^a] with lightning[^b] from his right hand[^c] for them. 









###### 3 




Indeed he loves the people.[^d] All your[^e] holy ones are in your hand, and they assemble[^f] at your feet. Each receives your words. 









###### 4 




Moses gave us instruction, a possession for the assembly of Jacob. 









###### 5 




So he became King in Jeshurun[^g] when the leaders of the people gathered with the tribes of Israel. 









###### 6 




Let Reuben live and not die though his people become few. 









###### 7 




He said this about Judah: Lord, hear Judah's cry and bring him to his people. He fights for his cause[^h] with his own hands, but may you be a help against his foes. 









###### 8 




He said about Levi: Your Thummim and Urim belong to your faithful one;[^i] you tested him at Massah and contended with him at the Waters of Meribah. 









###### 9 




He said about his father and mother, "I do not regard them." He disregarded his brothers and didn't acknowledge his sons, for they kept your word and maintained your covenant. 









###### 10 




They will teach your ordinances to Jacob and your instruction to Israel; they will set incense before you and whole burnt offerings on your altar. 









###### 11 




Lord, bless his possessions,[^j] and accept the work of his hands. Break the back[^k] of his adversaries and enemies, so that they cannot rise again. 









###### 12 




He said about Benjamin: The Lord's beloved rests[^l] securely on him. He[^m] shields him all day long, and he rests on his shoulders.[^n] 









###### 13 




He said about Joseph: May his land be blessed by the Lord with the dew of heaven's bounty and the watery depths that lie beneath; 









###### 14 




with the bountiful harvest from the sun and the abundant yield of the seasons; 









###### 15 




with the best products of the ancient mountains and the bounty of the eternal hills; 









###### 16 




with the choice gifts of the land and everything in it; and with the favor of him who appeared[^o] in the burning bush. May these rest on the head of Joseph, on the brow of the prince of his brothers. 









###### 17 




His firstborn bull has[^p] splendor, and horns like[^q] those of a wild ox; he gores all the peoples with them to the ends of the earth. Such are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and such are the thousands of Manasseh. 









###### 18 




He said about Zebulun: Rejoice, Zebulun, in your journeys, and Issachar, in your tents. 









###### 19 




They summon the peoples to a mountain; there they offer acceptable sacrifices. For they draw from the wealth of the seas and the hidden treasures of the sand. 









###### 20 




He said about Gad: The one who enlarges Gad's territory will be blessed. He lies down like a lion and tears off an arm or even a head. 









###### 21 




He chose the best part for himself, because a ruler's portion was assigned there for him. He came with the leaders of the people; he carried out the Lord's justice and his ordinances for Israel. 









###### 22 




He said about Dan: Dan is a young lion, leaping out of Bashan. 









###### 23 




He said about Naphtali: Naphtali, enjoying approval, full of the Lord's blessing, take[^r] possession to the west and the south. 









###### 24 




He said about Asher: May Asher[^s] be the most blessed of the sons; may he be the most favored among his brothers and dip his foot in olive oil. 









###### 25 




May the bolts of your gate be iron and bronze, and your strength last as long as you live. 









###### 26 




There is none like the God of Jeshurun, who rides the heavens to your aid, the clouds in his majesty. 









###### 27 




The God of old is your dwelling place, and underneath are the everlasting arms. He drives out the enemy before you and commands, "Destroy!" 









###### 28 




So Israel dwells securely; Jacob lives untroubled[^t] in a land of grain and new wine; even his skies drip with dew. 









###### 29 




How happy you are, Israel! Who is like you, a people saved by the Lord? He is the shield that protects you, the sword you boast in. Your enemies will cringe before you, and you will tread on their backs.[^u] ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

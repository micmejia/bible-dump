# Ecclesiastes 1

***










###### 1 




The words of the Teacher,[^a] son of David, king in Jerusalem. 









###### 2 




"Absolute futility," says the Teacher. "Absolute futility. Everything is futile." 









###### 3 




What does a person gain for all his efforts that he labors at under the sun? 









###### 4 




A generation goes and a generation comes, but the earth remains forever. 









###### 5 




The sun rises and the sun sets; panting, it hurries back to the place where it rises. 









###### 6 




Gusting to the south, turning to the north, turning, turning, goes the wind, and the wind returns in its cycles. 









###### 7 




All the streams flow to the sea, yet the sea is never full; to the place where the streams flow, there they flow again. 









###### 8 




All things[^b] are wearisome, more than anyone can say. The eye is not satisfied by seeing or the ear filled with hearing. 









###### 9 




What has been is what will be, and what has been done is what will be done; there is nothing new under the sun. 









###### 10 




Can one say about anything, "Look, this is new"? It has already existed in the ages before us. 









###### 11 




There is no remembrance of those who[^c] came before; and of those who will come after there will also be no remembrance by those who follow them. ## The Limitations of Wisdom 









###### 12 




I, the Teacher, have been[^d] king over Israel in Jerusalem. 









###### 13 




I applied my mind to examine and explore through wisdom all that is done under heaven. God has given people[^e] this miserable task to keep them occupied. 









###### 14 




I have seen all the things that are done under the sun and have found everything to be futile, a pursuit of the wind.[^f] 









###### 15 




What is crooked cannot be straightened; what is lacking cannot be counted. 









###### 16 




I said to myself, "See, I have amassed wisdom far beyond all those who were over Jerusalem before me, and my mind has thoroughly grasped[^g] wisdom and knowledge." 









###### 17 




I applied my mind to know wisdom and knowledge, madness and folly; I learned that this too is a pursuit of the wind. 









###### 18 




For with much wisdom is much sorrow; as knowledge increases, grief increases. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

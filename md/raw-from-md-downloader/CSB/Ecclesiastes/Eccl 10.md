# Ecclesiastes 10

***










###### 1 




Dead flies make a perfumer's oil ferment and stink; so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor. 









###### 2 




A wise person's heart goes to the[^a] right, but a fool's heart to the left. 









###### 3 




Even when the fool walks along the road, his heart lacks sense, and he shows everyone he is a fool. 









###### 4 




If the ruler's anger rises against you, don't leave your post, for calmness puts great offenses to rest. 









###### 5 




There is an evil I have seen under the sun, an error proceeding from the presence of the ruler: 









###### 6 




The fool is appointed to great heights, but the rich remain in lowly positions. 









###### 7 




I have seen slaves on horses, but princes walking on the ground like slaves. 









###### 8 




The one who digs a pit may fall into it, and the one who breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake. 









###### 9 




The one who quarries stones may be hurt by them; the one who splits logs may be endangered by them. 









###### 10 




If the ax is dull, and one does not sharpen its edge, then one must exert more strength; however, the advantage of wisdom is that it brings success. 









###### 11 




If the snake bites before it is charmed, then there is no advantage for the charmer.[^b] 









###### 12 




The words from the mouth of a wise person are gracious, but the lips of a fool consume him. 









###### 13 




The beginning of the words from his mouth is folly, but the end of his speaking is evil madness; 









###### 14 




yet the fool multiplies words. No one knows what will happen, and who can tell anyone what will happen after him? 









###### 15 




The struggles of fools weary them, for they don't know how to go to the city. 









###### 16 




Woe to you, land, when your king is a youth and your princes feast in the morning. 









###### 17 




Blessed are you, land, when your king is a son of nobles and your princes feast at the proper time-- for strength and not for drunkenness. 









###### 18 




Because of laziness the roof caves in, and because of negligent hands the house leaks. 









###### 19 




A feast is prepared for laughter, and wine makes life happy, and money[^c] is the answer for everything. 









###### 20 




Do not curse the king even in your thoughts, and do not curse a rich person even in your bedroom, for a bird of the sky may carry the message, and a winged creature may report the matter. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

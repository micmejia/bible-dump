# Ecclesiastes 3

***










###### 1 




There is an occasion for everything, and a time for every activity under heaven: 









###### 2 




a time to give birth and a time to die; a time to plant and a time to uproot;[^a] 









###### 3 




a time to kill and a time to heal; a time to tear down and a time to build; 









###### 4 




a time to weep and a time to laugh; a time to mourn and a time to dance; 









###### 5 




a time to throw stones and a time to gather stones; a time to embrace and a time to avoid embracing; 









###### 6 




a time to search and a time to count as lost; a time to keep and a time to throw away; 









###### 7 




a time to tear and a time to sew; a time to be silent and a time to speak; 









###### 8 




a time to love and a time to hate; a time for war and a time for peace. 









###### 9 




What does the worker gain from his struggles? 









###### 10 




I have seen the task that God has given the children of Adam to keep them occupied. 









###### 11 




He has made everything appropriate[^b] in its time. He has also put eternity in their hearts,[^c] but no one can discover the work God has done from beginning to end. 









###### 12 




I know that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice and enjoy the[^d] good life. 









###### 13 




It is also the gift of God whenever anyone eats, drinks, and enjoys all his efforts. 









###### 14 




I know that everything God does will last forever; there is no adding to it or taking from it. God works so that people will be in awe of him. 









###### 15 




Whatever is, has already been, and whatever will be, already is. However, God seeks justice for the persecuted.[^e] ## The Mystery of Injustice and Death 









###### 16 




I also observed under the sun: there is wickedness at the place of judgment and there is wickedness at the place of righteousness. 









###### 17 




I said to myself, "God will judge the righteous and the wicked, since there is a time for every activity and every work." 









###### 18 




I said to myself, "This happens so that God may test the children of Adam and they may see for themselves that they are like animals." 









###### 19 




For the fate of the children of Adam and the fate of animals is the same. As one dies, so dies the other; they all have the same breath. People have no advantage over animals since everything is futile. 









###### 20 




All are going to the same place; all come from dust, and all return to dust. 









###### 21 




Who knows if the spirits of the children of Adam go upward and the spirits of animals go downward to the earth? 









###### 22 




I have seen that there is nothing better than for a person to enjoy his activities because that is his reward. For who can enable him to see what will happen after he dies?[^f] ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

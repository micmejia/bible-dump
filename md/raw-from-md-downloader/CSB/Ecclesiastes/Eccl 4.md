# Ecclesiastes 4

***










###### 1 




Again, I observed all the acts of oppression being done under the sun. Look at the tears of those who are oppressed; they have no one to comfort them. Power is with those who oppress them; they have no one to comfort them. 









###### 2 




So I commended the dead, who have already died, more than the living, who are still alive. 









###### 3 




But better than either of them is the one who has not yet existed, who has not seen the evil activity that is done under the sun. ## The Loneliness of Wealth 









###### 4 




I saw that all labor and all skillful work is due to one person's jealousy of another. This too is futile and a pursuit of the wind.[^a] 









###### 5 




The fool folds his arms and consumes his own flesh. 









###### 6 




Better one handful with rest than two handfuls with effort and a pursuit of the wind. 









###### 7 




Again, I saw futility under the sun: 









###### 8 




There is a person without a companion,[^b] without even a son or brother, and though there is no end to all his struggles, his eyes are still not content with riches. "Who am I struggling for," he asks, "and depriving myself of good things?" This too is futile and a miserable task. 









###### 9 




Two are better than one because they have a good reward for their efforts. 









###### 10 




For if either falls, his companion can lift him up; but pity the one who falls without another to lift him up. 









###### 11 




Also, if two lie down together, they can keep warm; but how can one person alone keep warm? 









###### 12 




And if someone overpowers one person, two can resist him. A cord of three strands is not easily broken. 









###### 13 




Better is a poor but wise youth than an old but foolish king who no longer pays attention to warnings. 









###### 14 




For he came from prison to be king, even though he was born poor in his kingdom. 









###### 15 




I saw all the living, who move about under the sun, follow[^c] a second youth who succeeds him. 









###### 16 




There is no limit to all the people who were before them, yet those who come later will not rejoice in him. This too is futile and a pursuit of the wind. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

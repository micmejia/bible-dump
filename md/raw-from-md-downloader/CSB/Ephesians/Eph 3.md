# Ephesians 3

***










###### 1 




For this reason, I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles-- 









###### 2 




assuming you have heard about the administration of God's grace that he gave me for you. 









###### 3 




The mystery was made known to me by revelation, as I have briefly written above. 









###### 4 




By reading this you are able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ. 









###### 5 




This was not made known to people[^a] in other generations as it is now revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit: 









###### 6 




The Gentiles are coheirs, members of the same body, and partners in the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel. 









###### 7 




I was made a servant of this gospel by the gift of God's grace that was given to me by the working of his power. 









###### 8 




This grace was given to me--the least of all the saints--to proclaim to the Gentiles the incalculable riches of Christ, 









###### 9 




and to shed light for all about the administration of the mystery hidden for ages in God who created all things. 









###### 10 




This is so that God's multi-faceted wisdom may now be made known through the church to the rulers and authorities in the heavens. 









###### 11 




This is according to his eternal purpose accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord. 









###### 12 




In him we have boldness and confident access through faith in him.[^b] 









###### 13 




So, then, I ask you not to be discouraged over my afflictions on your behalf, for they are your glory. ## Prayer for Spiritual Power 









###### 14 




For this reason I kneel before the Father[^c] 









###### 15 




from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named. 









###### 16 




I pray that he may grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with power in your inner being through his Spirit, 









###### 17 




and that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. I pray that you, being rooted and firmly established in love, 









###### 18 




may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the length and width, height and depth of God's love, 









###### 19 




and to know Christ's love that surpasses knowledge, so that you may be filled with all the fullness of God. 









###### 20 




Now to him who is able to do above and beyond all that we ask or think according to the power that works in us-- 









###### 21 




to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever. Amen. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

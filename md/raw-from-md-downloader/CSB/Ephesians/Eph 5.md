# Ephesians 5

***










###### 1 




Therefore, be imitators of God, as dearly loved children, 









###### 2 




and walk in love, as Christ also loved us and gave himself for us, a sacrificial and fragrant offering to God. 









###### 3 




But sexual immorality and any impurity or greed should not even be heard of[^a] among you, as is proper for saints. 









###### 4 




Obscene and foolish talking or crude joking are not suitable, but rather giving thanks. 









###### 5 




For know and recognize this: Every sexually immoral or impure or greedy person, who is an idolater, does not have an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. ## Light versus Darkness 









###### 6 




Let no one deceive you with empty arguments, for God's wrath is coming on the disobedient[^b] because of these things. 









###### 7 




Therefore, do not become their partners. 









###### 8 




For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light-- 









###### 9 




for the fruit of the light[^c] consists of all goodness, righteousness, and truth-- 









###### 10 




testing what is pleasing to the Lord. 









###### 11 




Don't participate in the fruitless works of darkness, but instead expose them. 









###### 12 




For it is shameful even to mention what is done by them in secret. 









###### 13 




Everything exposed by the light is made visible, 









###### 14 




for what makes everything visible is light. Therefore it is said: Get up, sleeper, and rise up from the dead, and Christ will shine on you. ## Consistency in the Christian Life 









###### 15 




Pay careful attention, then, to how you walk--not as unwise people but as wise-- 









###### 16 




making the most of the time,[^d] because the days are evil. 









###### 17 




So don't be foolish, but understand what the Lord's will is. 









###### 18 




And don't get drunk with wine, which leads to reckless living, but be filled by the Spirit: 









###### 19 




speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and making music with your heart to the Lord, 









###### 20 




giving thanks always for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, 









###### 21 




submitting to one another in the fear of Christ. ## Wives and Husbands 









###### 22 




Wives, submit[^e] to your husbands as to the Lord, 









###### 23 




because the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church. He is the Savior of the body. 









###### 24 




Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives are to submit to their husbands in everything. 









###### 25 




Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself for her 









###### 26 




to make her holy, cleansing[^f] her with the washing of water by the word. 









###### 27 




He did this to present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or anything like that, but holy and blameless. 









###### 28 




In the same way, husbands are to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. 









###### 29 




For no one ever hates his own flesh but provides and cares for it, just as Christ does for the church, 









###### 30 




since we are members of his body.[^g] 









###### 31 




<b class="quote">For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife,** <b class="quote">and the two will become one flesh.**[^h] 









###### 32 




This mystery is profound, but I am talking about Christ and the church. 









###### 33 




To sum up, each one of you is to love his wife as himself, and the wife is to respect her husband. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Ephesians 6

***










###### 1 




Children, obey your parents in the Lord, because this is right. 









###### 2 




<b class="quote">Honor your father and mother**, which is the first commandment with a promise, 









###### 3 




<b class="quote">so that it may go well with you and that you may have a long life in the land.**[^a][^b] 









###### 4 




Fathers, don't stir up anger in your children, but bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord. ## Slaves and Masters 









###### 5 




Slaves, obey your human[^c] masters with fear and trembling, in the sincerity of your heart, as you would Christ. 









###### 6 




Don't work only while being watched, as people-pleasers, but as slaves of Christ, doing God's will from your heart. 









###### 7 




Serve with a good attitude, as to the Lord and not to people, 









###### 8 




knowing that whatever good each one does, slave or free, he will receive this back from the Lord. 









###### 9 




And masters, treat your slaves the same way, without threatening them, because you know that both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no favoritism with him. ## Christian Warfare 









###### 10 




Finally, be strengthened by the Lord and by his vast strength. 









###### 11 




Put on the full armor of God so that you can stand against the schemes of the devil. 









###### 12 




For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers of this darkness, against evil, spiritual forces in the heavens. 









###### 13 




For this reason take up the full armor of God, so that you may be able to resist in the evil day, and having prepared everything, to take your stand. 









###### 14 




Stand, therefore, with truth like a belt around your waist, righteousness like armor on your chest, 









###### 15 




and your feet sandaled with readiness for the gospel of peace. 









###### 16 




In every situation take up the shield of faith with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. 









###### 17 




Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit--which is the word of God. 









###### 18 




Pray at all times in the Spirit with every prayer and request, and stay alert with all perseverance and intercession for all the saints. 









###### 19 




Pray also for me, that the message may be given to me when I open my mouth to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel. 









###### 20 




For this I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I might be bold enough to speak about it as I should. ## Paul's Farewell 









###### 21 




Tychicus, our dearly loved brother and faithful servant[^d] in the Lord, will tell you all the news about me so that you may be informed. 









###### 22 




I am sending him to you for this very reason, to let you know how we are and to encourage your hearts. 









###### 23 




Peace to the brothers and sisters, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 









###### 24 




Grace be with all who have undying love for our Lord Jesus Christ.[^e][^f] ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Exodus 1

***










###### 1 




These are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt with Jacob; each came with his family: 









###### 2 




Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah; 









###### 3 




Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin; 









###### 4 




Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher. 









###### 5 




The total number of Jacob's descendants[^a] was seventy;[^b] Joseph was already in Egypt. 









###### 6 




Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation eventually died. 









###### 7 




But the Israelites were fruitful, increased rapidly, multiplied, and became extremely numerous so that the land was filled with them. 









###### 8 




A new king, who did not know about Joseph, came to power in Egypt. 









###### 9 




He said to his people, "Look, the Israelite people are more numerous and powerful than we are. 









###### 10 




Come, let's deal shrewdly with them; otherwise they will multiply further, and when war breaks out, they will join our enemies, fight against us, and leave the country." 









###### 11 




So the Egyptians assigned taskmasters over the Israelites to oppress them with forced labor. They built Pithom and Rameses as supply cities for Pharaoh. 









###### 12 




But the more they oppressed them, the more they multiplied and spread so that the Egyptians came to dread[^c] the Israelites. 









###### 13 




They worked the Israelites ruthlessly 









###### 14 




and made their lives bitter with difficult labor in brick and mortar and in all kinds of fieldwork. They ruthlessly imposed all this work on them. 









###### 15 




The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives--the first, whose name was Shiphrah, and the second, whose name was Puah-- 









###### 16 




"When you help the Hebrew women give birth, observe them as they deliver. If the child is a son, kill him, but if it's a daughter, she may live." 









###### 17 




The midwives, however, feared God and did not do as the king of Egypt had told them; they let the boys live. 









###### 18 




So the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, "Why have you done this and let the boys live?" 









###### 19 




The midwives said to Pharaoh, "The Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women, for they are vigorous and give birth before the midwife can get to them." 









###### 20 




So God was good to the midwives, and the people multiplied and became very numerous. 









###### 21 




Since the midwives feared God, he gave them families. 









###### 22 




Pharaoh then commanded all his people, "You must throw every son born to the Hebrews into the Nile, but let every daughter live." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Exodus 15

***










###### 1 




Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the Lord. They said: I will sing to the Lord, for he is highly exalted; he has thrown the horse and its rider into the sea. 









###### 2 




The Lord is my strength and my song;[^a] he has become my salvation. This is my God, and I will praise him, my father's God, and I will exalt him. 









###### 3 




The Lord is a warrior; the Lord is his name. 









###### 4 




He threw Pharaoh's chariots and his army into the sea; the elite of his officers were drowned in the Red Sea. 









###### 5 




The floods covered them; they sank to the depths like a stone. 









###### 6 




Lord, your right hand is glorious in power. Lord, your right hand shattered the enemy. 









###### 7 




You overthrew your adversaries by your great majesty. You unleashed your burning wrath; it consumed them like stubble. 









###### 8 




The water heaped up at the blast from your nostrils; the currents stood firm like a dam. The watery depths congealed in the heart of the sea. 









###### 9 




The enemy said: "I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil. My desire will be gratified at their expense. I will draw my sword; my hand will destroy[^b] them." 









###### 10 




But you blew with your breath, and the sea covered them. They sank like lead in the mighty waters. 









###### 11 




Lord, who is like you among the gods? Who is like you, glorious in holiness, revered with praises, performing wonders? 









###### 12 




You stretched out your right hand, and the earth swallowed them. 









###### 13 




With your faithful love, you will lead the people you have redeemed; you will guide them to your holy dwelling with your strength. 









###### 14 




When the peoples hear, they will shudder; anguish will seize the inhabitants of Philistia. 









###### 15 




Then the chiefs of Edom will be terrified; trembling will seize the leaders of Moab; all the inhabitants of Canaan will panic; 









###### 16 




terror and dread will fall on them. They will be as still[^c] as a stone because of your powerful arm until your people pass by, Lord, until the people whom you purchased[^d] pass by. 









###### 17 




You will bring them in and plant them on the mountain of your possession; Lord, you have prepared the place for your dwelling; Lord,[^e] your hands have established the sanctuary. 









###### 18 




The Lord will reign forever and ever! 









###### 19 




When Pharaoh's horses with his chariots and horsemen went into the sea, the Lord brought the water of the sea back over them. But the Israelites walked through the sea on dry ground. 









###### 20 




Then the prophetess Miriam, Aaron's sister, took a tambourine in her hand, and all the women came out following her with tambourines and dancing. 









###### 21 




Miriam sang to them: Sing to the Lord, for he is highly exalted; he has thrown the horse and its rider into the sea. ## Water Provided 









###### 22 




Then Moses led Israel on from the Red Sea, and they went out to the Wilderness of Shur. They journeyed for three days in the wilderness without finding water. 









###### 23 




They came to Marah, but they could not drink the water at Marah because it was bitter--that is why it was named Marah.[^f] 









###### 24 




The people grumbled to Moses, "What are we going to drink?" 









###### 25 




So he cried out to the Lord, and the Lord showed him a tree. When he threw it into the water, the water became drinkable. The Lord made a statute and ordinance for them at Marah, and he tested them there. 









###### 26 




He said, "If you will carefully obey the Lord your God, do what is right in his sight, pay attention to his commands, and keep all his statutes, I will not inflict any illnesses on you that I inflicted on the Egyptians. For I am the Lord who heals you." 









###### 27 




Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs and seventy date palms, and they camped there by the water. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

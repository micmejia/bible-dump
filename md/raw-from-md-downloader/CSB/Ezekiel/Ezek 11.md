# Ezekiel 11

***










###### 1 




The Spirit then lifted me up and brought me to the eastern gate of the Lord's house, which faces east, and at the gate's entrance were twenty-five men. Among them I saw Jaazaniah son of Azzur, and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, leaders of the people. 









###### 2 




The Lord[^a] said to me, "Son of man, these are the men who plot evil and give wicked advice in this city. 









###### 3 




They are saying, 'Isn't the time near to build houses?[^b] The city is the pot, and we are the meat.' 









###### 4 




Therefore, prophesy against them. Prophesy, son of man!" 









###### 5 




Then the Spirit of the Lord came on me, and he told me, "You are to say, 'This is what the Lord says: That is what you are thinking, house of Israel; and I know the thoughts that arise in your mind. 









###### 6 




You have multiplied your slain in this city, filling its streets with them. 









###### 7 




"'Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: The slain you have put within it are the meat, and the city is the pot, but I[^c] will take you out of it. 









###### 8 




You fear the sword, so I will bring the sword against you. This is the declaration of the Lord God. 









###### 9 




I will take you out of the city and hand you over to foreigners; I will execute judgments against you. 









###### 10 




You will fall by the sword, and I will judge you at the border of Israel. Then you will know that I am the Lord. 









###### 11 




The city will not be a pot for you, and you will not be the meat within it. I will judge you at the border of Israel, 









###### 12 




so you will know that I am the Lord, whose statutes you have not followed and whose ordinances you have not practiced. Instead, you have acted according to the ordinances of the nations around you.'" 









###### 13 




Now while I was prophesying, Pelatiah son of Benaiah died. Then I fell facedown and cried out loudly, "Oh, Lord God! You are bringing the remnant of Israel to an end!" ## Promise of Israel's Restoration 









###### 14 




The word of the Lord came to me again: 









###### 15 




"Son of man, your own relatives, those who have the right to redeem your property,[^d][^e] along with the entire house of Israel--all of them--are those to whom the residents of Jerusalem have said, 'You are far from the Lord; this land has been given to us as a possession.' 









###### 16 




"Therefore say, 'This is what the Lord God says: Though I sent them far away among the nations and scattered them among the countries, yet for a little while I have been a sanctuary for them in the countries where they have gone.' 









###### 17 




"Therefore say, 'This is what the Lord God says: I will gather you from the peoples and assemble you from the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.' 









###### 18 




"When they arrive there, they will remove all its abhorrent acts and detestable practices from it. 









###### 19 




I will give them integrity of[^f] heart and put a new spirit within them; I will remove their heart of stone from their bodies[^g] and give them a heart of flesh, 









###### 20 




so that they will follow my statutes, keep my ordinances, and practice them. They will be my people, and I will be their God. 









###### 21 




But as for those whose hearts pursue their desire for abhorrent acts and detestable practices, I will bring their conduct down on their own heads." This is the declaration of the Lord God. ## God's Glory Leaves Jerusalem 









###### 22 




Then the cherubim, with the wheels beside them, lifted their wings, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them. 









###### 23 




The glory of the Lord rose up from within the city and stopped on the mountain east of the city.[^h] 









###### 24 




The Spirit lifted me up and brought me to Chaldea and to the exiles in a vision from the Spirit of God. After the vision I had seen left me, 









###### 25 




I spoke to the exiles about all the things the Lord had shown me. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

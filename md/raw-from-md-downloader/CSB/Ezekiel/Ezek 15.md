# Ezekiel 15

***










###### 1 




Then the word of the Lord came to me: 









###### 2 




"Son of man, how does the wood of the vine, that branch among the trees of the forest, compare to any other wood? 









###### 3 




Can wood be taken from it to make something useful? Or can anyone make a peg from it to hang things on? 









###### 4 




In fact, it is put into the fire as fuel. The fire devours both of its ends, and the middle is charred. Can it be useful for anything? 









###### 5 




Even when it was whole it could not be made into a useful object. How much less can it ever be made into anything useful when the fire has devoured it and it is charred!" 









###### 6 




Therefore, this is what the Lord God says, "Like the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire as fuel, so I will give up the residents of Jerusalem. 









###### 7 




I will turn against them. They may have escaped from the fire, but it will still consume them. And you will know that I am the Lord when I turn against them. 









###### 8 




I will make the land desolate because they have acted unfaithfully." This is the declaration of the Lord God. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

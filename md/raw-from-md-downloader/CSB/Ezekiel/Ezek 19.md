# Ezekiel 19

***










###### 1 




"As for you, take up a lament for the princes of Israel, 









###### 2 




and say: What was your mother? A lioness! She lay down among the lions; she reared her cubs among the young lions. 









###### 3 




She brought up one of her cubs, and he became a young lion. After he learned to tear prey, he devoured people. 









###### 4 




When the nations heard about him, he was caught in their pit. Then they led him away with hooks to the land of Egypt. 









###### 5 




When she saw that she waited in vain, that her hope was lost, she took another of her cubs and made him a young lion. 









###### 6 




He prowled among the lions, and he became a young lion. After he learned to tear prey, he devoured people. 









###### 7 




He devastated their strongholds[^a] and destroyed their cities. The land and everything in it shuddered at the sound of his roaring. 









###### 8 




Then the nations from the surrounding provinces set out against him. They spread their net over him; he was caught in their pit. 









###### 9 




They put a wooden yoke on him[^b] with hooks and led him away to the king of Babylon. They brought him into the fortresses so his roar could no longer be heard on the mountains of Israel. 









###### 10 




Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard,[^c] planted by the water; it was fruitful and full of branches because of abundant water. 









###### 11 




It had strong branches, fit for the scepters of rulers; its height towered among the clouds.[^d] So it was conspicuous for its height as well as its many branches. 









###### 12 




But it was uprooted in fury, thrown to the ground, and the east wind dried up its fruit. Its strong branches were torn off and dried up; fire consumed them. 









###### 13 




Now it is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty land. 









###### 14 




Fire has gone out from its main branch[^e] and has devoured its fruit, so that it no longer has a strong branch, a scepter for ruling. This is a lament and should be used as a lament." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

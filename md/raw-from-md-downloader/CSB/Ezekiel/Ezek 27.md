***










###### 1 




The word of the Lord came to me: 









###### 2 




"Now, son of man, lament for Tyre. 









###### 3 




Say to Tyre, who is situated at the entrance of the sea, merchant of the peoples to many coasts and islands, 'This is what the Lord God says: Tyre, you declared, "I am perfect in beauty." 









###### 4 




Your realm was in the heart of the sea; your builders perfected your beauty. 









###### 5 




They constructed all your planking with pine trees from Senir. They took a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for you. 









###### 6 




They made your oars of oaks from Bashan. They made your deck of cypress wood from the coasts of Cyprus, inlaid with ivory. 









###### 7 




Your sail was made of fine embroidered linen from Egypt, and served as your banner. Your awning was of blue and purple fabric from the coasts of Elishah. 









###### 8 




The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were your rowers. Your wise men were within you, Tyre; they were your captains. 









###### 9 




The elders of Gebal and its wise men were within you, repairing your leaks. "'All the ships of the sea and their sailors came to you to barter for your goods. 









###### 10 




Men of Persia, Lud, and Put were in your army, serving as your warriors. They hung shields and helmets in you; they gave you splendor. 









###### 11 




Men of Arvad and Helech were stationed on your walls all around, and Gammadites were in your towers. They hung their shields[^a] all around your walls; they perfected your beauty. 









###### 12 




"'Tarshish was your trading partner because of your abundant wealth of every kind. They exchanged silver, iron, tin, and lead for your merchandise. 









###### 13 




Javan, Tubal, and Meshech were your merchants. They exchanged slaves[^b] and bronze utensils for your goods. 









###### 14 




Those from Beth-togarmah exchanged horses, war horses, and mules for your merchandise. 









###### 15 




Men of Dedan[^c] were also your merchants; many coasts and islands were your regular markets. They brought back ivory tusks and ebony as your payment. 









###### 16 




Aram[^d] was your trading partner because of your numerous products. They exchanged turquoise,[^e] purple and embroidered cloth, fine linen, coral,[^f] and rubies[^g] for your merchandise. 









###### 17 




Judah and the land of Israel were your merchants. They exchanged wheat from Minnith, meal,[^h] honey, oil, and balm, for your goods. 









###### 18 




Damascus was also your trading partner because of your numerous products and your abundant wealth of every kind, trading in wine from Helbon and white wool.[^i] 









###### 19 




Vedan[^j] and Javan from Uzal[^k] dealt in your merchandise; wrought iron, cassia, and aromatic cane were exchanged for your goods. 









###### 20 




Dedan was your merchant in saddlecloths for riding. 









###### 21 




Arabia and all the princes of Kedar were your business partners, trading with you in lambs, rams, and goats. 









###### 22 




The merchants of Sheba and Raamah traded with you. For your merchandise they exchanged the best of all spices and all kinds of precious stones as well as gold. 









###### 23 




Haran, Canneh, Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, and Chilmad traded with you. 









###### 24 




They were your merchants in choice garments, cloaks of blue and embroidered materials, and multicolored carpets,[^l] which were bound and secured with cords in your marketplace. 









###### 25 




Ships of Tarshish were the carriers for your goods. "'So you became full and heavily loaded[^m] in the heart of the sea. 









###### 26 




Your rowers have brought you onto the high seas, but the east wind has wrecked you in the heart of the sea. 









###### 27 




Your wealth, merchandise, and goods, your sailors and captains, those who repair your leaks, those who barter for your goods, and all the warriors on board, with all the other people within you, sink into the heart of the sea on the day of your downfall. 









###### 28 




"'The countryside shakes at the sound of your sailors' cries. 









###### 29 




All the oarsmen disembark from their ships. The sailors and all the captains of the sea stand on the shore. 









###### 30 




Because of you, they raise their voices and cry out bitterly. They throw dust on their heads; they roll in ashes. 









###### 31 




They shave their heads because of you and wrap themselves in sackcloth. They weep over you with deep anguish and bitter mourning. 









###### 32 




"'In their wailing they lament for you, mourning over you: "Who was like Tyre, silenced[^n] in the middle of the sea? 









###### 33 




When your merchandise was unloaded from the seas, you satisfied many peoples. You enriched the kings of the earth with your abundant wealth and goods. 









###### 34 




Now you are wrecked by the sea in the depths of the waters; your goods and the people within you have gone down. 









###### 35 




All the inhabitants of the coasts and islands are appalled at you. Their kings shudder with fear; their faces are contorted. 









###### 36 




Those who trade among the peoples scoff[^o] at you; you have become an object of horror and will never exist again."'" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Ezekiel 28

***










###### 1 




The word of the Lord came to me: 









###### 2 




"Son of man, say to the ruler of Tyre, 'This is what the Lord God says: Your[^a] heart is proud, and you have said, "I am a god; I sit in the seat of gods in the heart of the sea." Yet you are a man and not a god, though you have regarded your heart as that of a god. 









###### 3 




Yes, you are wiser than Daniel; no secret is hidden from you! 









###### 4 




By your wisdom and understanding you have acquired wealth for yourself. You have acquired gold and silver for your treasuries. 









###### 5 




By your great skill in trading you have increased your wealth, but your heart has become proud because of your wealth. 









###### 6 




"'Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: Because you regard your heart as that of a god, 









###### 7 




I am about to bring strangers against you, ruthless men from the nations. They will draw their swords against your magnificent wisdom and will pierce your splendor. 









###### 8 




They will bring you down to the Pit, and you will die a violent death in the heart of the sea. 









###### 9 




Will you still say, "I am a god," in the presence of those who slay[^b] you? Yet you will be only a man, not a god, in the hands of those who kill you. 









###### 10 




You will die the death of the uncircumcised at the hands of strangers. For I have spoken. This is the declaration of the Lord God.'" ## A Lament for Tyre's King 









###### 11 




The word of the Lord came to me: 









###### 12 




"Son of man, lament for the king of Tyre and say to him, 'This is what the Lord God says: You were the seal[^c] of perfection,[^d] full of wisdom and perfect in beauty. 









###### 13 




You were in Eden, the garden of God. Every kind of precious stone covered you: carnelian, topaz, and diamond,[^e] beryl, onyx, and jasper, lapis lazuli, turquoise[^f] and emerald.[^g] Your mountings and settings were crafted in gold; they were prepared on the day you were created. 









###### 14 




You were an anointed guardian cherub, for[^h] I had appointed you. You were on the holy mountain of God; you walked among the fiery stones. 









###### 15 




From the day you were created you were blameless in your ways until wickedness was found in you. 









###### 16 




Through the abundance of your trade, you were filled with violence, and you sinned. So I expelled you in disgrace from the mountain of God, and banished you, guardian cherub,[^i] from among the fiery stones. 









###### 17 




Your heart became proud because of your beauty; For the sake of your splendor you corrupted your wisdom. So I threw you down to the ground;[^j] I made you a spectacle before kings. 









###### 18 




You profaned your sanctuaries by the magnitude of your iniquities in your dishonest trade. So I made fire come from within you, and it consumed you. I reduced you to ashes on the ground in the sight of everyone watching you. 









###### 19 




All those who know you among the peoples are appalled at you. You have become an object of horror and will never exist again.'" ## A Prophecy against Sidon 









###### 20 




The word of the Lord came to me: 









###### 21 




"Son of man, face Sidon and prophesy against it. 









###### 22 




You are to say, 'This is what the Lord God says: Look! I am against you, Sidon, and I will display my glory within you. They will know that I am the Lord when I execute judgments against her and demonstrate my holiness through her. 









###### 23 




I will send a plague against her and bloodshed in her streets; the slain will fall within her, while the sword is against her[^k] on every side. Then they will know that I am the Lord. 









###### 24 




"'The house of Israel will no longer be hurt by[^l] prickly briers or painful thorns from all their neighbors who treat them with contempt. Then they will know that I am the Lord God. 









###### 25 




"'This is what the Lord God says: When I gather the house of Israel from the peoples where they are scattered, I will demonstrate my holiness through them in the sight of the nations, and they will live in their own land, which I gave to my servant Jacob. 









###### 26 




They will live there securely, build houses, and plant vineyards. They will live securely when I execute judgments against all their neighbors who treat them with contempt. Then they will know that I am the Lord their God.'" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Ezekiel 30

***










###### 1 




The word of the Lord came to me: 









###### 2 




"Son of man, prophesy and say, 'This is what the Lord God says: Wail, "Woe because of that day!" 









###### 3 




For a day is near; a day belonging to the Lord is near. It will be a day of clouds, a time of doom[^a] for the nations. 









###### 4 




A sword will come against Egypt, and there will be anguish in Cush when the slain fall in Egypt, and its wealth is taken away, and its foundations are demolished. 









###### 5 




Cush, Put, and Lud, and all the various foreign troops,[^b] plus Libya[^c] and the men of the covenant land will fall by the sword along with them. 









###### 6 




This is what the Lord says: Those who support Egypt will fall, and its proud strength will collapse. From Migdol to Syene they will fall within it by the sword. This is the declaration of the Lord God. 









###### 7 




They will be desolate among[^d] desolate lands, and their cities will lie among ruined[^e] cities. 









###### 8 




They will know that I am the Lord when I set fire to Egypt and all its allies are shattered. 









###### 9 




On that day, messengers will go out from me in ships to terrify confident Cush. Anguish will come over them on the day of Egypt's doom.[^f] For indeed it is coming. 









###### 10 




"'This is what the Lord God says: I will put an end to the hordes[^g] of Egypt by the hand of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. 









###### 11 




He along with his people, ruthless men from the nations, will be brought in to destroy the land. They will draw their swords against Egypt and fill the land with the slain. 









###### 12 




I will make the streams dry and sell the land to evil men. I will bring desolation on the land and everything in it by the hands of foreigners. I, the Lord, have spoken. 









###### 13 




"'This is what the Lord God says: I will destroy the worthless idols and put an end to the false gods in Memphis. There will no longer be a prince from the land of Egypt. And I will instill fear in that land. 









###### 14 




I will make Pathros desolate, set fire to Zoan, and execute judgments on Thebes. 









###### 15 




I will pour out my wrath on Pelusium, the stronghold of Egypt, and will wipe out the hordes of Thebes. 









###### 16 




I will set fire to Egypt; Pelusium will writhe in anguish, Thebes will be breached, and Memphis will face foes in broad daylight.[^h] 









###### 17 




The young men of On[^i] and Pi-beseth will fall by the sword, and those cities[^j] will go into captivity. 









###### 18 




The day will be dark[^k] in Tehaphnehes, when I break the yoke of Egypt there and its proud strength comes to an end in the city. A cloud will cover Tehaphnehes,[^l] and its surrounding villages will go into captivity. 









###### 19 




So I will execute judgments against Egypt, and they will know that I am the Lord.'" ## Pharaoh's Power Broken 









###### 20 




In the eleventh year, in the first month, on the seventh day of the month, the word of the Lord came to me: 









###### 21 




"Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt. Look, it has not been bandaged--no medicine has been applied and no splint put on to bandage it so that it can grow strong enough to handle a sword. 









###### 22 




Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: Look! I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt. I will break his arms, both the strong one and the one already broken, and will make the sword fall from his hand. 









###### 23 




I will disperse the Egyptians among the nations and scatter them among the countries. 









###### 24 




I will strengthen the arms of Babylon's king and place my sword in his hand. But I will break the arms of Pharaoh, and he will groan before him as a mortally wounded man. 









###### 25 




I will strengthen the arms of Babylon's king, but Pharaoh's arms will fall. They will know that I am the Lord when I place my sword in the hand of Babylon's king and he wields it against the land of Egypt. 









###### 26 




When I disperse the Egyptians among the nations and scatter them among the countries, they will know that I am the Lord." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

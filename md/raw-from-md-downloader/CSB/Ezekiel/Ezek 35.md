# Ezekiel 35

***










###### 1 




The word of the Lord came to me: 









###### 2 




"Son of man, face Mount Seir and prophesy against it. 









###### 3 




Say to it, 'This is what the Lord God says: Look! I am against you, Mount Seir. I will stretch out my hand against you and make you a desolate waste. 









###### 4 




I will turn your cities into ruins, and you will become a desolation. Then you will know that I am the Lord. 









###### 5 




"'Because you maintained a perpetual hatred and gave the Israelites over to the power of the sword in the time of their disaster, the time of final punishment, 









###### 6 




therefore, as I live--this is the declaration of the Lord God--I will destine you for bloodshed, and it will pursue you. Since you did not hate bloodshed, it will pursue you. 









###### 7 




I will make Mount Seir a desolate waste and will cut off from it those who come and go. 









###### 8 




I will fill its mountains with the slain; those slain by the sword will fall on your hills, in your valleys, and in all your ravines. 









###### 9 




I will make you a perpetual desolation; your cities will not be inhabited. Then you will know that I am the Lord. 









###### 10 




"'Because you said, "These two nations and two lands will be mine, and we will possess them"--though the Lord was there-- 









###### 11 




therefore, as I live--this is the declaration of the Lord God--I will treat you according to the anger and jealousy you showed in your hatred of them. I will make myself known among them[^a] when I judge you. 









###### 12 




Then you will know that I, the Lord, have heard all the blasphemies you uttered against the mountains of Israel, saying, "They are desolate. They have been given to us to devour!" 









###### 13 




You boasted against me with your mouth, and spoke many words against me. I heard it myself! 









###### 14 




"'This is what the Lord God says: While the whole world rejoices, I will make you a desolation. 









###### 15 




Just as you rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel because it became a desolation, I will deal the same way with you: you will become a desolation, Mount Seir, and so will all Edom in its entirety. Then they will know that I am the Lord.' ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

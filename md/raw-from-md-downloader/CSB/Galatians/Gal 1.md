# Galatians 1

***










###### 1 




Paul, an apostle--not from men or by man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead-- 









###### 2 




and all the brothers who are with me: To the churches of Galatia. 









###### 3 




Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord[^a] Jesus Christ, 









###### 4 




who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father. 









###### 5 




To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen. ## No Other Gospel 









###### 6 




I am amazed that you are so quickly turning away from him who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel-- 









###### 7 




not that there is another gospel, but there are some who are troubling you and want to distort the gospel of Christ. 









###### 8 




But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to what we have preached to you, a curse be on him![^b] 









###### 9 




As we have said before, I now say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received, a curse be on him! 









###### 10 




For am I now trying to persuade people,[^c] or God? Or am I striving to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a servant of Christ. ## The Origin of Paul's Gospel 









###### 11 




For I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that the gospel preached by me is not of human origin. 









###### 12 




For I did not receive it from a human source and I was not taught it, but it came by a revelation of Jesus Christ. 









###### 13 




For you have heard about my former way of life in Judaism: I intensely persecuted God's church and tried to destroy it. 









###### 14 




I advanced in Judaism beyond many contemporaries among my people, because I was extremely zealous for the traditions of my ancestors. 









###### 15 




But when God, who from my mother's womb set me apart and called me by his grace, was pleased 









###### 16 




to reveal his Son in me, so that I could preach him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with anyone.[^d] 









###### 17 




I did not go up to Jerusalem to those who had become apostles before me; instead I went to Arabia and came back to Damascus. 









###### 18 




Then after three years I did go up to Jerusalem to get to know Cephas,[^e] and I stayed with him fifteen days. 









###### 19 




But I didn't see any of the other apostles except James, the Lord's brother. 









###### 20 




I declare in the sight of God: I am not lying in what I write to you. 









###### 21 




Afterward, I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia. 









###### 22 




I remained personally unknown to the Judean churches that are in Christ. 









###### 23 




They simply kept hearing, "He who formerly persecuted us now preaches the faith he once tried to destroy." 









###### 24 




And they glorified God because of me.[^f] ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Galatians 6

***










###### 1 




Brothers and sisters, if someone is overtaken in any wrongdoing, you who are spiritual, restore such a person with a gentle spirit,[^a] watching out for yourselves so that you also won't be tempted. 









###### 2 




Carry one another's burdens; in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ. 









###### 3 




For if anyone considers himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceives himself. 









###### 4 




Let each person examine his own work, and then he can take pride in himself alone, and not compare himself with someone else. 









###### 5 




For each person will have to carry his own load. 









###### 6 




Let the one who is taught the word share all his good things with the teacher. 









###### 7 




Don't be deceived: God is not mocked. For whatever a person sows he will also reap, 









###### 8 




because the one who sows to his flesh will reap destruction from the flesh, but the one who sows to the Spirit will reap eternal life from the Spirit. 









###### 9 




Let us not get tired of doing good, for we will reap at the proper time if we don't give up. 









###### 10 




Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us work for the good of all, especially for those who belong to the household of faith. ## Concluding Exhortation 









###### 11 




Look at what large letters I use as I write to you in my own handwriting. 









###### 12 




Those who want to make a good impression in the flesh are the ones who would compel you to be circumcised--but only to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Christ. 









###### 13 




For even the circumcised don't keep the law themselves, and yet they want you to be circumcised in order to boast about your flesh. 









###### 14 




But as for me, I will never boast about anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. The world has been crucified to me through the cross, and I to the world. 









###### 15 




For[^b] both circumcision and uncircumcision mean nothing; what matters instead is a new creation. 









###### 16 




May peace come to all those who follow this standard, and mercy even to the Israel of God![^c] 









###### 17 




From now on, let no one cause me trouble, because I bear on my body the marks of Jesus. 









###### 18 




Brothers and sisters, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

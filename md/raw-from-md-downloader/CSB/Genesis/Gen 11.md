# Genesis 11

***










###### 1 




The whole earth had the same language and vocabulary. 









###### 2 




As people migrated from the east,[^a] they found a valley in the land of Shinar and settled there. 









###### 3 




They said to each other, "Come, let's make oven-fired bricks." (They used brick for stone and asphalt for mortar.) 









###### 4 




And they said, "Come, let's build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the sky. Let's make a name for ourselves; otherwise, we will be scattered throughout the earth." 









###### 5 




Then the Lord came down to look over the city and the tower that the humans[^b] were building. 









###### 6 




The Lord said, "If they have begun to do this as one people all having the same language, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them. 









###### 7 




Come, let's go down there and confuse their language so that they will not understand one another's speech." 









###### 8 




So from there the Lord scattered them throughout the earth, and they stopped building the city. 









###### 9 




Therefore it is called Babylon,[^c][^d] for there the Lord confused the language of the whole earth, and from there the Lord scattered them throughout the earth. ## From Shem to Abram

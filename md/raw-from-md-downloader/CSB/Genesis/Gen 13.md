# Genesis 13

***










###### 1 




Abram went up from Egypt to the Negev--he, his wife, and all he had, and Lot with him. 









###### 2 




Abram was very rich in livestock, silver, and gold. 









###### 3 




He went by stages from the Negev to Bethel, to the place between Bethel and Ai where his tent had formerly been, 









###### 4 




to the site where he had built the altar. And Abram called on the name of the Lord there. 









###### 5 




Now Lot, who was traveling with Abram, also had flocks, herds, and tents. 









###### 6 




But the land was unable to support them as long as they stayed together, for they had so many possessions that they could not stay together, 









###### 7 




and there was quarreling between the herdsmen of Abram's livestock and the herdsmen of Lot's livestock. (At that time the Canaanites and the Perizzites were living in the land.) 









###### 8 




So Abram said to Lot, "Please, let's not have quarreling between you and me, or between your herdsmen and my herdsmen, since we are relatives. 









###### 9 




Isn't the whole land before you? Separate from me: if you go to the left, I will go to the right; if you go to the right, I will go to the left." 









###### 10 




Lot looked out and saw that the entire plain[^a] of the Jordan as far as Zoar was well watered everywhere like the Lord's garden and the land of Egypt. (This was before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.) 









###### 11 




So Lot chose the entire plain of the Jordan for himself. Then Lot journeyed eastward, and they separated from each other. 









###### 12 




Abram lived in the land of Canaan, but Lot lived in the cities on the plain and set up his tent near Sodom. 









###### 13 




(Now the men of Sodom were evil, sinning immensely[^b] against the Lord.) 









###### 14 




After Lot had separated from him, the Lord said to Abram, "Look from the place where you are. Look north and south, east and west, 









###### 15 




for I will give you and your offspring[^c] forever all the land that you see. 









###### 16 




I will make your offspring like the dust of the earth, so that if anyone could count the dust of the earth, then your offspring could be counted. 









###### 17 




Get up and walk around the land, through its length and width, for I will give it to you." 









###### 18 




So Abram moved his tent and went to live near the oaks of Mamre at Hebron, where he built an altar to the Lord. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

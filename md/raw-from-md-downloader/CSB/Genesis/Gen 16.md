# Genesis 16

***










###### 1 




Abram's wife, Sarai, had not borne any children for him, but she owned an Egyptian slave named Hagar. 









###### 2 




Sarai said to Abram, "Since the Lord has prevented me from bearing children, go to my slave; perhaps through her I can build a family." And Abram agreed to what Sarai said. 









###### 3 




So Abram's wife, Sarai, took Hagar, her Egyptian slave, and gave her to her husband, Abram, as a wife for him. This happened after Abram had lived in the land of Canaan ten years. 









###### 4 




He slept with[^a] Hagar, and she became pregnant. When she saw that she was pregnant, her mistress became contemptible to her. 









###### 5 




Then Sarai said to Abram, "You are responsible for my suffering![^b] I put my slave in your arms,[^c] and when she saw that she was pregnant, I became contemptible to her. May the Lord judge between me and you." 









###### 6 




Abram replied to Sarai, "Here, your slave is in your power; do whatever you want with her." Then Sarai mistreated her so much that she ran away from her. 









###### 7 




The angel of the Lord found her by a spring in the wilderness, the spring on the way to Shur. 









###### 8 




He said, "Hagar, slave of Sarai, where have you come from and where are you going?" She replied, "I'm running away from my mistress Sarai." 









###### 9 




The angel of the Lord said to her, "Go back to your mistress and submit to her authority." 









###### 10 




The angel of the Lord said to her, "I will greatly multiply your offspring, and they will be too many to count." 









###### 11 




The angel of the Lord said to her, "You have conceived and will have a son. You will name him Ishmael,[^d] for the Lord has heard your cry of affliction. 









###### 12 




This man will be like a wild donkey. His hand will be against everyone, and everyone's hand will be against him; he will settle near all his relatives." 









###### 13 




So she named the Lord who spoke to her: "You are El-roi,"[^e] for she said, "In this place, have I actually seen the one who sees me?" [^f] 









###### 14 




That is why the well is called Beer-lahai-roi.[^g] It is between Kadesh and Bered. 









###### 15 




So Hagar gave birth to Abram's son, and Abram named his son (whom Hagar bore) Ishmael. 









###### 16 




Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to him. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

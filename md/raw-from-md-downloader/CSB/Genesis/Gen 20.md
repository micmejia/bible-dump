# Genesis 20

***










###### 1 




From there Abraham traveled to the region of the Negev and settled between Kadesh and Shur. While he was staying in Gerar, 









###### 2 




Abraham said about his wife Sarah, "She is my sister." So King Abimelech of Gerar had Sarah brought to him. 









###### 3 




But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night and said to him, "You are about to die because of the woman you have taken, for she is a married woman."[^a] 









###### 4 




Now Abimelech had not approached her, so he said, "Lord, would you destroy a nation even though it is innocent? 









###### 5 




Didn't he himself say to me, 'She is my sister'? And she herself said, 'He is my brother.' I did this with a clear conscience[^b] and clean[^c] hands." 









###### 6 




Then God said to him in the dream, "Yes, I know that you did this with a clear conscience.[^d] I have also kept you from sinning against me. Therefore I have not let you touch her. 









###### 7 




Now return the man's wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you will live. But if you do not return her, know that you will certainly die, you and all who are yours." 









###### 8 




Early in the morning Abimelech got up, called all his servants together, and personally[^e] told them all these things, and the men were terrified. 









###### 9 




Then Abimelech called Abraham in and said to him, "What have you done to us? How did I sin against you that you have brought such enormous guilt on me and on my kingdom? You have done things to me that should never be done." 









###### 10 




Abimelech also asked Abraham, "What made you do this?" 









###### 11 




Abraham replied, "I thought, 'There is absolutely no fear of God in this place. They will kill me because of my wife.' 









###### 12 




Besides, she really is my sister, the daughter of my father though not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife. 









###### 13 




So when God had me wander from my father's house, I said to her: Show your loyalty to me wherever we go and say about me, 'He's my brother.'" 









###### 14 




Then Abimelech took flocks and herds and male and female slaves, gave them to Abraham, and returned his wife Sarah to him. 









###### 15 




Abimelech said, "Look, my land is before you. Settle wherever you want."[^f] 









###### 16 




And he said to Sarah, "Look, I am giving your brother one thousand pieces of silver. It is a verification of your honor[^g] to all who are with you. You are fully vindicated." 









###### 17 




Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, his wife, and his female slaves so that they could bear children, 









###### 18 




for the Lord had completely closed all the wombs in Abimelech's household on account of Sarah, Abraham's wife. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Genesis 33

***










###### 1 




Now Jacob looked up and saw Esau coming toward him with four hundred men. So he divided the children among Leah, Rachel, and the two slave women. 









###### 2 




He put the slaves and their children first, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph last. 









###### 3 




He himself went on ahead and bowed to the ground seven times until he approached his brother. 









###### 4 




But Esau ran to meet him, hugged him, threw his arms around him, and kissed him. Then they wept. 









###### 5 




When Esau looked up and saw the women and children, he asked, "Who are these with you?" He answered, "The children God has graciously given your servant." 









###### 6 




Then the slaves and their children approached him and bowed down. 









###### 7 




Leah and her children also approached and bowed down, and then Joseph and Rachel approached and bowed down. 









###### 8 




So Esau said, "What do you mean by this whole procession[^a] I met?" "To find favor with you, my lord," he answered. 









###### 9 




"I have enough, my brother," Esau replied. "Keep what you have." 









###### 10 




But Jacob said, "No, please! If I have found favor with you, take this gift from me. For indeed, I have seen your face, and it is like seeing God's face, since you have accepted me. 









###### 11 




Please take my present that was brought to you, because God has been gracious to me and I have everything I need." So Jacob urged him until he accepted. 









###### 12 




Then Esau said, "Let's move on, and I'll go ahead of you." 









###### 13 




Jacob replied, "My lord knows that the children are weak, and I have nursing flocks and herds. If they are driven hard for one day, the whole herd will die. 









###### 14 




Let my lord go ahead of his servant. I will continue on slowly, at a pace suited to the livestock and the children, until I come to my lord at Seir." 









###### 15 




Esau said, "Let me leave some of my people with you." But he replied, "Why do that? Please indulge me,[^b] my lord." 









###### 16 




That day Esau started on his way back to Seir, 









###### 17 




but Jacob went to Succoth. He built a house for himself and shelters for his livestock; that is why the place was called Succoth.[^c] 









###### 18 




After Jacob came from Paddan-aram, he arrived safely at Shechem in the land of Canaan and camped in front of the city. 









###### 19 




He purchased a section of the field where he had pitched his tent from the sons of Hamor, Shechem's father, for a hundred pieces of silver.[^d] 









###### 20 




And he set up an altar there and called it God, the God of Israel.[^e] ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

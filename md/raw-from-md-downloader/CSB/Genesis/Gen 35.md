# Genesis 35

***










###### 1 




God said to Jacob, "Get up! Go to Bethel and settle there. Build an altar there to the God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau." 









###### 2 




So Jacob said to his family and all who were with him, "Get rid of the foreign gods that are among you. Purify yourselves and change your clothes. 









###### 3 




We must get up and go to Bethel. I will build an altar there to the God who answered me in my day of distress. He has been with me everywhere I have gone." 









###### 4 




Then they gave Jacob all their foreign gods and their earrings, and Jacob hid them under the oak near Shechem. 









###### 5 




When they set out, a terror from God came over the cities around them, and they did not pursue Jacob's sons. 









###### 6 




So Jacob and all who were with him came to Luz (that is, Bethel) in the land of Canaan. 









###### 7 




Jacob built an altar there and called the place El-bethel[^a] because it was there that God had revealed himself to him when he was fleeing from his brother. 









###### 8 




Deborah, the one who had nursed and raised Rebekah,[^b] died and was buried under the oak south of Bethel. So Jacob named it Allon-bacuth.[^c] 









###### 9 




God appeared to Jacob again after he returned from Paddan-aram, and he blessed him. 









###### 10 




God said to him, "Your name is Jacob; you will no longer be named Jacob, but your name will be Israel." So he named him Israel. 









###### 11 




God also said to him, "I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply. A nation, indeed an assembly of nations, will come from you, and kings will descend from you.[^d] 









###### 12 




I will give to you the land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac. And I will give the land to your future descendants." 









###### 13 




Then God withdrew[^e] from him at the place where he had spoken to him. 









###### 14 




Jacob set up a marker at the place where he had spoken to him--a stone marker. He poured a drink offering on it and poured oil on it. 









###### 15 




Jacob named the place where God had spoken with him Bethel. ## Rachel's Death 









###### 16 




They set out from Bethel. When they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel began to give birth, and her labor was difficult. 









###### 17 




During her difficult labor, the midwife said to her, "Don't be afraid, for you have another son." 









###### 18 




With her last breath--for she was dying--she named him Ben-oni,[^f] but his father called him Benjamin.[^g] 









###### 19 




So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem). 









###### 20 




Jacob set up a marker on her grave; it is the marker at Rachel's grave still today. ## Israel's Sons 









###### 21 




Israel set out again and pitched his tent beyond the Tower of Eder.[^h] 









###### 22 




While Israel was living in that region, Reuben went in and slept with his father's concubine Bilhah, and Israel heard about it. Jacob had twelve sons: 









###### 23 




Leah's sons were Reuben (Jacob's firstborn), Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun. 









###### 24 




Rachel's sons were Joseph and Benjamin. 









###### 25 




The sons of Rachel's slave Bilhah were Dan and Naphtali. 









###### 26 




The sons of Leah's slave Zilpah were Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Paddan-aram. ## Isaac's Death 









###### 27 




Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre in Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had stayed. 









###### 28 




Isaac lived 180 years. 









###### 29 




He took his last breath and died, and was gathered to his people, old and full of days. His sons Esau and Jacob buried him. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

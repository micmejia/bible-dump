# Habakkuk 1

***










###### 1 




The pronouncement that the prophet Habakkuk saw. ## Habakkuk's First Prayer 









###### 2 




How long, Lord, must I call for help and you do not listen or cry out to you about violence and you do not save? 









###### 3 




Why do you force me to look at injustice? Why do you tolerate[^a] wrongdoing? Oppression and violence are right in front of me. Strife is ongoing, and conflict escalates. 









###### 4 




This is why the law is ineffective and justice never emerges. For the wicked restrict the righteous; therefore, justice comes out perverted. ## God's First Answer 









###### 5 




Look at the nations[^b] and observe-- be utterly astounded! For I am doing something in your days that you will not believe when you hear about it. 









###### 6 




Look! I am raising up the Chaldeans,[^c] that bitter, impetuous nation that marches across the earth's open spaces to seize territories not its own. 









###### 7 




They are fierce and terrifying; their views of justice and sovereignty stem from themselves. 









###### 8 




Their horses are swifter than leopards and more fierce[^d] than wolves of the night. Their horsemen charge ahead; their horsemen come from distant lands. They fly like eagles, swooping to devour. 









###### 9 




All of them come to do violence; their faces are set in determination.[^e] They gather prisoners like sand. 









###### 10 




They mock kings, and rulers are a joke to them. They laugh at every fortress and build siege ramps to capture it. 









###### 11 




Then they sweep by like the wind and pass through. They are guilty;[^f] their strength is their god. ## Habakkuk's Second Prayer 









###### 12 




Are you not from eternity, Lord my God? My Holy One, you[^g] will not die. Lord, you appointed them to execute judgment; my Rock, you destined them to punish us. 









###### 13 




Your eyes are too pure to look on evil, and you cannot tolerate wrongdoing. So why do you tolerate those who are treacherous? Why are you silent while one[^h] who is wicked swallows up one[^i] who is more righteous than himself? 









###### 14 




You have made mankind like the fish of the sea, like marine creatures that have no ruler. 









###### 15 




The Chaldeans pull them all up with a hook, catch them in their dragnet, and gather them in their fishing net; that is why they are glad and rejoice. 









###### 16 




That is why they sacrifice to their dragnet and burn incense to their fishing net, for by these things their portion is rich and their food plentiful. 









###### 17 




Will they therefore empty their net and continually slaughter nations without mercy? ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

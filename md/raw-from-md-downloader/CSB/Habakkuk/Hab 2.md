# Habakkuk 2

***










###### 1 




I will stand at my guard post and station myself on the lookout tower. I will watch to see what he will say to me and what I should[^a] reply about my complaint. ## God's Second Answer 









###### 2 




The Lord answered me: Write down this vision; clearly inscribe it on tablets so one may easily read it.[^b] 









###### 3 




For the vision is yet for the appointed time; it testifies about the end and will not lie. Though it delays, wait for it, since it will certainly come and not be late. 









###### 4 




Look, his ego is inflated;[^c] he is without integrity. But the righteous one will live by his faith.[^d] 









###### 5 




Moreover, wine[^e] betrays; an arrogant man is never at rest.[^f] He enlarges his appetite like Sheol, and like Death he is never satisfied. He gathers all the nations to himself; he collects all the peoples for himself. ## The Five Woe Oracles 









###### 6 




Won't all of these take up a taunt against him, with mockery and riddles about him? They will say, "Woe to him who amasses what is not his-- how much longer?-- and loads himself with goods taken in pledge." 









###### 7 




Won't your creditors suddenly arise, and those who disturb you wake up? Then you will become spoil for them. 









###### 8 




Since you have plundered many nations, all the peoples who remain will plunder you-- because of human bloodshed and violence against lands, cities, and all who live in them. 









###### 9 




Woe to him who dishonestly makes wealth for his house[^g] to place his nest on high, to escape the grasp of disaster! 









###### 10 




You have planned shame for your house by wiping out many peoples and sinning against your own self. 









###### 11 




For the stones will cry out from the wall, and the rafters will answer them from the woodwork. 









###### 12 




Woe to him who builds a city with bloodshed and founds a town with injustice! 









###### 13 




Is it not from the Lord of Armies that the peoples labor only to fuel the fire and countries exhaust themselves for nothing? 









###### 14 




For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the Lord's glory, as the water covers the sea. 









###### 15 




Woe to him who gives his neighbors drink, pouring out your wrath[^h] and even making them drunk, in order to look at their nakedness! 









###### 16 




You will be filled with disgrace instead of glory. You also--drink, and expose your uncircumcision![^i] The cup in the Lord's right hand will come around to you, and utter disgrace will cover your glory. 









###### 17 




For your violence against Lebanon will overwhelm you; the destruction of animals will terrify you[^j] because of your human bloodshed and violence against lands, cities, and all who live in them. 









###### 18 




What use is a carved idol after its craftsman carves it? It is only a cast image, a teacher of lies. For the one who crafts its shape trusts in it and makes worthless idols that cannot speak. 









###### 19 




Woe to him who says to wood: Wake up! or to mute stone: Come alive! Can it teach? Look! It may be plated with gold and silver, yet there is no breath in it at all. 









###### 20 




But the Lord is in his holy temple; let the whole earth be silent in his presence. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

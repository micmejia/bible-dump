# Haggai 2

***










###### 1 




On the twenty-first day of the seventh month, the word of the Lord came through the prophet Haggai: 









###### 2 




"Speak to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, to the high priest Joshua son of Jehozadak, and to the remnant of the people: 









###### 3 




'Who is left among you who saw this house in its former glory? How does it look to you now? Doesn't it seem to you like nothing by comparison? 









###### 4 




Even so, be strong, Zerubbabel--this is the Lord's declaration. Be strong, Joshua son of Jehozadak, high priest. Be strong, all you people of the land--this is the Lord's declaration. Work! For I am with you--the declaration of the Lord of Armies. 









###### 5 




This is the promise I made to you when you came out of Egypt, and my Spirit is present among you; don't be afraid.'" 









###### 6 




For the Lord of Armies says this: "Once more, in a little while, I am going to shake the heavens and the earth, the sea and the dry land. 









###### 7 




I will shake all the nations so that the treasures of all the nations will come, and I will fill this house with glory," says the Lord of Armies. 









###### 8 




"The silver and gold belong to me"--this is the declaration of the Lord of Armies. 









###### 9 




"The final glory of this house[^a] will be greater than the first," says the Lord of Armies. "I will provide peace in this place"--this is the declaration of the Lord of Armies. ## From Deprivation to Blessing 









###### 10 




On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to the prophet Haggai: 









###### 11 




"This is what the Lord of Armies says: Ask the priests for a ruling. 









###### 12 




If a man is carrying consecrated meat in the fold of his garment, and it touches bread, stew, wine, oil, or any other food, does it become holy?" The priests answered, "No." 









###### 13 




Then Haggai asked, "If someone defiled by contact with a corpse touches any of these, does it become defiled?" The priests answered, "It becomes defiled." 









###### 14 




Then Haggai replied, "So is this people, and so is this nation before me--this is the Lord's declaration. And so is every work of their hands; even what they offer there is defiled. 









###### 15 




"Now from this day on, think carefully: Before one stone was placed on another in the Lord's temple, 









###### 16 




what state were you in?[^b] When someone came to a grain heap of twenty measures, it only amounted to ten; when one came to the winepress to dip fifty measures from the vat, it only amounted to twenty. 









###### 17 




I struck you--all the work of your hands--with blight, mildew, and hail, but you didn't turn to me--this is the Lord's declaration. 









###### 18 




From this day on, think carefully; from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, from the day the foundation of the Lord's temple was laid; think carefully. 









###### 19 




Is there still seed left in the granary? The vine, the fig, the pomegranate, and the olive tree have not yet produced. But from this day on I will bless you." ## Promise to Zerubbabel 









###### 20 




The word of the Lord came to Haggai a second time on the twenty-fourth day of the month: 









###### 21 




"Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah: I am going to shake the heavens and the earth. 









###### 22 




I will overturn royal thrones and destroy the power of the Gentile kingdoms. I will overturn chariots and their riders. Horses and their riders will fall, each by his brother's sword. 









###### 23 




On that day"--this is the declaration of the Lord of Armies--"I will take you, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, my servant"--this is the Lord's declaration--"and make you like my signet ring, for I have chosen you." This is the declaration of the Lord of Armies. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

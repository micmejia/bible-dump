# Hebrews 1

***










###### 1 




Long ago God spoke to our ancestors by the prophets at different times and in different ways. 









###### 2 




In these last days, he has spoken to us by his Son. God has appointed him heir of all things and made the universe[^a] through him. 









###### 3 




The Son is the radiance[^b] of God's glory and the exact expression[^c] of his nature, sustaining all things by his powerful word. After making purification for sins,[^d] he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.[^e] 









###### 4 




So he became superior to the angels, just as the name he inherited is more excellent than theirs. ## The Son Superior to Angels 









###### 5 




For to which of the angels did he ever say, <b class="quote">You are my Son;** <b class="quote">today I have become your Father,**[^f][^g] or again, <b class="quote">I will be his Father,** <b class="quote">and he will be my Son**?[^h] 









###### 6 




Again, when he[^i] brings his firstborn into the world, he says, <b class="quote">And let all God's angels worship him.**[^j] 









###### 7 




And about the angels he says: <b class="quote">He makes his angels winds,**[^k] <b class="quote">and his servants**[^l] <b class="quote">a fiery flame,**[^m] 









###### 8 




but to[^n] the Son: <b class="quote">Your throne, God,** <b class="quote">is forever and ever,** <b class="quote">and the scepter of your kingdom** <b class="quote">is a scepter of justice.** 









###### 9 




<b class="quote">You have loved righteousness** <b class="quote">and hated lawlessness;** <b class="quote">this is why God, your God,** <b class="quote">has anointed you** <b class="quote">with the oil of joy** <b class="quote">beyond your companions.**[^o][^p] 









###### 10 




And: <b class="quote">In the beginning, Lord,** <b class="quote">you established the earth,** <b class="quote">and the heavens are the works of your hands;** 









###### 11 




<b class="quote">they will perish, but you remain.** <b class="quote">They will all wear out like clothing;** 









###### 12 




<b class="quote">you will roll them up like a cloak,**[^q] <b class="quote">and they will be changed like clothing.** <b class="quote">But you are the same,** <b class="quote">and your years will never end.**[^r] 









###### 13 




Now to which of the angels has he ever said: <b class="quote">Sit at my right hand** <b class="quote">until I make your enemies your footstool**?[^s]

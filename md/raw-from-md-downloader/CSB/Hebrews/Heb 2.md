# Hebrews 2

***










###### 1 




For this reason, we must pay attention all the more to what we have heard, so that we will not drift away. 









###### 2 




For if the message spoken through angels was legally binding[^a] and every transgression and disobedience received a just punishment, 









###### 3 




how will we escape if we neglect such a great salvation? This salvation had its beginning when it was spoken of by the Lord, and it was confirmed to us by those who heard him. 









###### 4 




At the same time, God also testified by signs and wonders, various miracles, and distributions of gifts from the Holy Spirit according to his will. ## Jesus and Humanity 









###### 5 




For he has not subjected to angels the world to come that we are talking about. 









###### 6 




But someone somewhere has testified: <b class="quote">What is man that you remember him,** <b class="quote">or the son of man that you care for him?** 









###### 7 




<b class="quote">You made him lower than the angels** <b class="quote">for a short time;** <b class="quote">you crowned him with glory and honor**[^b] 









###### 8 




<b class="quote">and subjected everything under his feet.**[^c] For in <b class="quote">subjecting everything** to him, he left nothing that is not subject to him. As it is, we do not yet see <b class="quote">everything subjected** to him. 









###### 9 




But we do see Jesus--<b class="quote">made lower than the angels for a short time** so that by God's grace he might taste death for everyone--<b class="quote">crowned with glory and honor** because he suffered death. 









###### 10 




For in bringing many sons and daughters to glory, it was entirely appropriate that God--for whom and through whom all things exist--should make the pioneer[^d] of their salvation perfect through sufferings. 









###### 11 




For the one who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one Father.[^e] That is why Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters, 









###### 12 




saying: <b class="quote">I will proclaim your name to my brothers and sisters;** <b class="quote">I will sing hymns to you in the congregation.**[^f] 









###### 13 




Again, <b class="quote">I will trust in him.**[^g] And again, <b class="quote">Here I am with the children God gave me.**[^h] 









###### 14 




Now since the children have flesh and blood in common, Jesus also shared in these, so that through his death he might destroy the one holding the power of death--that is, the devil-- 









###### 15 




and free those who were held in slavery all their lives by the fear of death. 









###### 16 




For it is clear that he does not reach out to help angels, but to help Abraham's offspring. 









###### 17 




Therefore, he had to be like his brothers and sisters in every way, so that he could become a merciful and faithful high priest in matters[^i] pertaining to God, to make atonement[^j] for the sins of the people. 









###### 18 




For since he himself has suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Hebrews 3

***










###### 1 




Therefore, holy brothers and sisters, who share in a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession. 









###### 2 




He was faithful to the one who appointed him, just as Moses was in all God's household. 









###### 3 




For Jesus is considered worthy of more glory than Moses, just as the builder has more honor than the house. 









###### 4 




Now every house is built by someone, but the one who built everything is God. 









###### 5 




Moses was faithful as a servant in all God's household, as a testimony to what would be said in the future. 









###### 6 




But Christ was faithful as a Son over his household. And we are that household if we hold on to our confidence and the hope in which we boast.[^a] ## Warning against Unbelief 









###### 7 




Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says: <b class="quote">Today, if you hear his voice,** 









###### 8 




<b class="quote">do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion,** <b class="quote">on the day of testing in the wilderness,** 









###### 9 




<b class="quote">where your ancestors tested me, tried me**, <b class="quote">and saw my works** <sup class="versenum mid-line">10</sup><b class="quote">for forty years.** <b class="quote">Therefore I was provoked to anger with that generation** <b class="quote">and said, "They always go astray in their hearts,** <b class="quote">and they have not known my ways."** 









###### 11 




<b class="quote">So I swore in my anger,** <b class="quote">"They will not enter my rest."**[^b] 









###### 12 




Watch out, brothers and sisters, so that there won't be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God. 









###### 13 




But encourage each other daily, while it is still called <b class="quote">today**, so that none of you is hardened by sin's deception. 









###### 14 




For we have become participants in Christ if we hold firmly until the end the reality[^c] that we had at the start. 









###### 15 




As it is said: <b class="quote">Today, if you hear his voice,** <b class="quote">do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.**[^d] 









###### 16 




For who heard and rebelled? Wasn't it all who came out of Egypt under Moses? 









###### 17 




With whom was God angry for forty years? Wasn't it with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness? 









###### 18 




And to whom did he swear that they would not enter his rest, if not to those who disobeyed? 









###### 19 




So we see that they were unable to enter because of unbelief. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

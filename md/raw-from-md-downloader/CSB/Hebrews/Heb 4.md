# Hebrews 4

***










###### 1 




Therefore, since the promise to enter his rest remains, let us beware[^a] that none of you be found to have fallen short.[^b] 









###### 2 




For we also have received the good news just as they did. But the message they heard did not benefit them, since they were not united with those who heard it in faith.[^c] 









###### 3 




For we who have believed enter the rest, in keeping with what[^d] he has said, <b class="quote">So I swore in my anger,** <b class="quote">"They will not enter my rest,"**[^e] even though his works have been finished since the foundation of the world. 









###### 4 




For somewhere he has spoken about the seventh day in this way: <b class="quote">And on the seventh day God rested from all his works.**[^f] 









###### 5 




Again, in that passage he says, <b class="quote">They will never enter my rest.**[^g] 









###### 6 




Therefore, since it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly received the good news did not enter because of disobedience, 









###### 7 




he again specifies a certain day--<b class="quote">today**. He specified this speaking through David after such a long time: <b class="quote">Today, if you hear his voice,** <b class="quote">do not harden your hearts.**[^h] 









###### 8 




For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later about another day. 









###### 9 




Therefore, a Sabbath rest remains for God's people. 









###### 10 




For the person who has entered his rest has rested from his own works, just as God did from his. 









###### 11 




Let us, then, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will fall into the same pattern of disobedience. 









###### 12 




For the word of God is living and effective and sharper than any double-edged sword, penetrating as far as the separation of soul and spirit, joints and marrow. It is able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart. 









###### 13 




No creature is hidden from him, but all things are naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give an account. ## Our Great High Priest 









###### 14 




Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens--Jesus the Son of God--let us hold fast to our confession. 









###### 15 




For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who has been tempted in every way as we are, yet without sin. 









###### 16 




Therefore, let us approach the throne of grace with boldness, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in time of need. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Hebrews 5

***










###### 1 




For every high priest taken from among men is appointed in matters pertaining to God for the people, to offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins. 









###### 2 




He is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and are going astray, since he is also clothed with weakness. 









###### 3 




Because of this, he must make an offering for his own sins as well as for the people. 









###### 4 




No one takes this honor on himself; instead, a person is called by God, just as Aaron was. 









###### 5 




In the same way, Christ did not exalt himself to become a high priest, but God who said to him, <b class="quote">You are my Son;** <b class="quote">today I have become your Father,**[^a][^b] 









###### 6 




also says in another place, <b class="quote">You are a priest forever** <b class="quote">according to the order of Melchizedek.**[^c] 









###### 7 




During his earthly life,[^d] he offered prayers and appeals with loud cries and tears to the one who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverence. 









###### 8 




Although he was the Son, he learned obedience from what he suffered. 









###### 9 




After he was perfected, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him, 









###### 10 




and he was declared by God a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek. ## The Problem of Immaturity 









###### 11 




We have a great deal to say about this, and it is difficult to explain, since you have become too lazy to understand. 









###### 12 




Although by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you the basic principles of God's revelation again. You need milk, not solid food. 









###### 13 




Now everyone who lives on milk is inexperienced with the message about righteousness, because he is an infant. 









###### 14 




But solid food is for the mature--for those whose senses have been trained to distinguish between good and evil. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Hebrews 8

***










###### 1 




Now the main point of what is being said is this: We have this kind of high priest, who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, 









###### 2 




a minister of the sanctuary and the true tabernacle that was set up by the Lord and not man. 









###### 3 




For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; therefore, it was necessary for this priest also to have something to offer. 









###### 4 




Now if he were on earth, he wouldn't be a priest, since there are those[^a] offering the gifts prescribed by the law. 









###### 5 




These serve as a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, as Moses was warned when he was about to complete the tabernacle. For God said, <b class="quote">Be careful that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown to you on the mountain.**[^b] 









###### 6 




But Jesus has now obtained a superior ministry, and to that degree he is the mediator of a better covenant, which has been established on better promises. ## A Superior Covenant 









###### 7 




For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion for a second one. 









###### 8 




But finding fault with his people,[^c] he says:[^d] <b class="quote">See, the days are coming, says the Lord,** <b class="quote">when I will make a new covenant** <b class="quote">with the house of Israel** <b class="quote">and with the house of Judah--** 









###### 9 




<b class="quote">not like the covenant** <b class="quote">that I made with their ancestors** <b class="quote">on the day I took them by the hand** <b class="quote">to lead them out of the land of Egypt.** <b class="quote">I showed no concern for them, says the Lord,** <b class="quote">because they did not continue in my covenant.** 









###### 10 




<b class="quote">For this is the covenant** <b class="quote">that I will make with the house of Israel** <b class="quote">after those days, says the Lord:** <b class="quote">I will put my laws into their minds** <b class="quote">and write them on their hearts.** <b class="quote">I will be their God,** <b class="quote">and they will be my people.** 









###### 11 




<b class="quote">And each person will not teach his fellow citizen,**[^e] <b class="quote">and each his brother or sister, saying, "Know the Lord,"** <b class="quote">because they will all know me,** <b class="quote">from the least to the greatest of them.** 









###### 12 




<b class="quote">For I will forgive their wrongdoing,** <b class="quote">and I will never again remember their sins.**[^f][^g] 









###### 13 




By saying <b class="quote">a new covenant**, he has declared that the first is obsolete. And what is obsolete and growing old is about to pass away. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

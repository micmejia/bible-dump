# Hosea 1

***










###### 1 




The word of the Lord that came to Hosea son of Beeri during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and of Jeroboam son of Jehoash, king of Israel. ## Hosea's Marriage and Children 









###### 2 




When the Lord first spoke to Hosea, he said this to him: Go and marry a woman of promiscuity, and have children of promiscuity, for the land is committing blatant acts of promiscuity by abandoning the Lord. 









###### 3 




So he went and married Gomer daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son. 









###### 4 




Then the Lord said to him: Name him Jezreel,[^a] for in a little while I will bring the bloodshed of Jezreel on the house of Jehu and put an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel. 









###### 5 




On that day I will break the bow of Israel in Jezreel Valley. 









###### 6 




She conceived again and gave birth to a daughter, and the Lord said to him: Name her Lo-ruhamah,[^b] for I will no longer have compassion on the house of Israel. I will certainly take them away. 









###### 7 




But I will have compassion on the house of Judah, and I will deliver them by the Lord their God. I will not deliver them by bow, sword, or war, or by horses and cavalry. 









###### 8 




After Gomer had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived and gave birth to a son. 









###### 9 




Then the Lord said: Name him Lo-ammi,[^c] for you are not my people, and I will not be your God.[^d] 









###### 10 




Yet the number of the Israelites will be like the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured or counted. And in the place where they were told: You are not my people, they will be called: Sons of the living God. 









###### 11 




And the Judeans and the Israelites will be gathered together. They will appoint for themselves a single ruler and go up from[^e] the land. For the day of Jezreel will be great. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Hosea 10

***










###### 1 




Israel is a lush[^a] vine; it yields fruit for itself. The more his fruit increased, the more he increased the altars. The better his land produced, the better they made the sacred pillars. 









###### 2 




Their hearts are devious;[^b] now they must bear their guilt. The Lord will break down their altars and demolish their sacred pillars. 









###### 3 




In fact, they are now saying, "We have no king! For we do not fear the Lord. What can a king do for us?" 









###### 4 




They speak mere words, taking false oaths while making covenants. So lawsuits break out like poisonous weeds in the furrows of a field. 









###### 5 




The residents of Samaria will have anxiety over the calf of Beth-aven. Indeed, its idolatrous priests rejoiced over it; the people will mourn over it, over its glory. It will certainly go into exile. 









###### 6 




The calf itself will be taken to Assyria as an offering to the great king.[^c] Ephraim will experience shame; Israel will be ashamed of its counsel. 









###### 7 




Samaria's king will disappear[^d] like foam[^e] on the surface of the water. 









###### 8 




The high places of Aven, the sin of Israel, will be destroyed; thorns and thistles will grow over their altars. They will say to the mountains, "Cover us!" and to the hills, "Fall on us!" ## Israel's Defeat because of Sin 









###### 9 




Israel, you have sinned since the days of Gibeah; they have taken their stand there. Will not war against the unjust overtake them in Gibeah? 









###### 10 




I will discipline them at my discretion; nations will be gathered against them to put them in bondage[^f] for their double iniquity. 









###### 11 




Ephraim is a well-trained calf that loves to thresh, but I will place a yoke on[^g] her fine neck. I will harness Ephraim; Judah will plow; Jacob will do the final plowing. 









###### 12 




Sow righteousness for yourselves and reap faithful love; break up your unplowed ground. It is time to seek the Lord until he comes and sends righteousness on you like the rain. 









###### 13 




You have plowed wickedness and reaped injustice; you have eaten the fruit of lies. Because you have trusted in your own way[^h] and in your large number of soldiers, 









###### 14 




the roar of battle will rise against your people, and all your fortifications will be demolished in a day of war, like Shalman's destruction of Beth-arbel. Mothers will be dashed to pieces along with their children. 









###### 15 




So it will be done to you, Bethel, because of your extreme evil. At dawn the king of Israel will be totally destroyed. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

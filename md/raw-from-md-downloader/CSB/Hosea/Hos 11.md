# Hosea 11

***










###### 1 




When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son. 









###### 2 




Israel called to the Egyptians even as Israel was leaving them.[^a] They kept sacrificing to the Baals and burning offerings to idols. 









###### 3 




It was I who taught Ephraim to walk, taking them[^b] by the hand,[^c] but they never knew that I healed them. 









###### 4 




I led them with human cords, with ropes of love. To them I was like one who eases the yoke from their jaws; I bent down to give them food. 









###### 5 




Israel will not return to the land of Egypt and Assyria will be his king, because they refused to repent. 









###### 6 




A sword will whirl through his cities; it will destroy and devour the bars of his gates,[^d] because of their schemes. 









###### 7 




My people are bent on turning from me. Though they call to him on high, he will not exalt them at all. 









###### 8 




How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I surrender you, Israel? How can I make you like Admah? How can I treat you like Zeboiim? I have had a change of heart; my compassion is stirred! 









###### 9 




I will not vent the full fury of my anger; I will not turn back to destroy Ephraim. For I am God and not man, the Holy One among you; I will not come in rage.[^e] 









###### 10 




They will follow the Lord; he will roar like a lion. When he roars, his children will come trembling from the west. 









###### 11 




They will be roused like birds from Egypt and like doves from the land of Assyria. Then I will settle them in their homes. This is the Lord's declaration. 









###### 12 




Ephraim surrounds me with lies, the house of Israel, with deceit. Judah still wanders with God and is faithful to the holy ones.[^f] ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Hosea 12

***










###### 1 




Ephraim chases[^a] the wind and pursues the east wind. He continually multiplies lies and violence. He makes a covenant with Assyria, and olive oil is carried to Egypt. 









###### 2 




The Lord also has a dispute with Judah. He is about to punish Jacob according to his conduct; he will repay him based on his actions. 









###### 3 




In the womb he grasped his brother's heel, and as an adult he wrestled with God. 









###### 4 




Jacob struggled with the angel and prevailed; he wept and sought his favor. He found him at Bethel, and there he spoke with him.[^b] 









###### 5 




The Lord is the God of Armies; the Lord is his name. 









###### 6 




But you must return to your God. Maintain love and justice, and always put your hope in God. 









###### 7 




A merchant loves to extort with dishonest scales in his hands. 









###### 8 




But Ephraim thinks, "How rich I have become; I made it all myself. In all my earnings, no one can find any iniquity in me that I can be punished for!" [^c] ## Judgment on Apostate Israel 









###### 9 




I have been the Lord your God ever since[^d] the land of Egypt. I will make you live in tents again, as in the festival days. 









###### 10 




I will speak through the prophets and grant many visions; I will give parables through the prophets. 









###### 11 




Since Gilead is full of evil, they will certainly come to nothing. They sacrifice bulls in Gilgal; even their altars will be like piles of rocks on the furrows of a field. ## Further Indictment of Jacob's Heirs 









###### 12 




Jacob fled to the territory of Aram. Israel worked to earn a wife; he tended flocks for a wife. 









###### 13 




The Lord brought Israel from Egypt by a prophet, and Israel was tended by a prophet. 









###### 14 




Ephraim has provoked bitter anger, so his Lord will leave his bloodguilt on him and repay him for his contempt. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Hosea 13

***










###### 1 




When Ephraim spoke, there was trembling; he was exalted in Israel. But he incurred guilt through Baal and died. 









###### 2 




Now they continue to sin and make themselves a cast image, idols skillfully made from their silver, all of them the work of craftsmen. People say about them, "Let the men who sacrifice[^a] kiss the calves." 









###### 3 




Therefore, they will be like the morning mist, like the early dew that vanishes, like chaff blown from a threshing floor, or like smoke from a window. ## Death and Resurrection 









###### 4 




I have been the Lord your God ever since[^b] the land of Egypt; you know no God but me, and no Savior exists besides me. 









###### 5 




I knew[^c] you in the wilderness, in the land of drought. 









###### 6 




When they had pasture, they became satisfied; they were satisfied, and their hearts became proud. Therefore they forgot me. 









###### 7 




So I will be like a lion to them; I will lurk like a leopard on the path. 









###### 8 




I will attack them like a bear robbed of her cubs and tear open the rib cage over their hearts. I will devour them there like a lioness, like a wild beast that would rip them open. 









###### 9 




I will destroy you, Israel; you have no help but me.[^d] 









###### 10 




Where now is your king,[^e] that he may save you in all your cities, and the[^f] rulers[^g] you demanded, saying, "Give me a king and leaders"? 









###### 11 




I give you a king in my anger and take away a king in my wrath. 









###### 12 




Ephraim's guilt is preserved; his sin is stored up. 









###### 13 




Labor pains come on him. He is not a wise son; when the time comes, he will not be born.[^h] 









###### 14 




I will ransom them from the power of Sheol. I will redeem[^i] them from death. Death, where are your barbs? Sheol, where is your sting? Compassion is hidden from my eyes. ## The Coming Judgment 









###### 15 




Although he flourishes among his brothers,[^j] an east wind will come, a wind from the Lord rising up from the desert. His water source will fail, and his spring will run dry. The wind[^k] will plunder the treasury of every precious item. 









###### 16 




Samaria will bear her guilt because she has rebelled against her God. They will fall by the sword; their children will be dashed to pieces, and their pregnant women ripped open. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Hosea 3

***










###### 1 




Then the Lord said to me, "Go again; show love to a woman who is loved by another man and is an adulteress, just as the Lord loves the Israelites though they turn to other gods and love raisin cakes." 









###### 2 




So I bought her for fifteen shekels of silver and nine bushels of barley.[^a][^b] 









###### 3 




I said to her, "You are to live with me many days. You must not be promiscuous or belong to any man, and I will act the same way toward you." 









###### 4 




For the Israelites must live many days without king or prince, without sacrifice or sacred pillar, and without ephod or household idols. 









###### 5 




Afterward, the people of Israel will return and seek the Lord their God and David their king. They will come with awe to the Lord and to his goodness in the last days. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Hosea 5

***










###### 1 




Hear this, priests! Pay attention, house of Israel! Listen, royal house! For the judgment applies to you because you have been a snare at Mizpah and a net spread out on Tabor. 









###### 2 




Rebels are deeply involved in slaughter; I will be a punishment for all of them.[^a] 









###### 3 




I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hidden from me. For now, Ephraim, you have acted promiscuously; Israel is defiled. 









###### 4 




Their actions do not allow them to return to their God, for a spirit of promiscuity is among them, and they do not know the Lord. 









###### 5 




Israel's arrogance testifies against them.[^b] Both Israel and Ephraim stumble because of their iniquity; even Judah will stumble with them. 









###### 6 




They go with their flocks and herds to seek the Lord but do not find him; he has withdrawn from them. 









###### 7 




They betrayed the Lord; indeed, they gave birth to illegitimate children. Now the New Moon will devour them along with their fields. 









###### 8 




Blow the ram's horn in Gibeah, the trumpet in Ramah; raise the war cry in Beth-aven: Look behind you,[^c] Benjamin! 









###### 9 




Ephraim will become a desolation on the day of punishment; I announce what is certain among the tribes of Israel. 









###### 10 




The princes of Judah are like those who move boundary markers; I will pour out my fury on them like water. 









###### 11 




Ephraim is oppressed, crushed in judgment, for he is determined to follow what is worthless.[^d] 









###### 12 




So I am like rot to Ephraim and like decay to the house of Judah. 









###### 13 




When Ephraim saw his sickness and Judah his wound, Ephraim went to Assyria and sent a delegation to the great king.[^e] But he cannot cure you or heal your wound. 









###### 14 




For I am like a lion to Ephraim and like a young lion to the house of Judah. Yes, I will tear them to pieces and depart. I will carry them off, and no one can rescue them. 









###### 15 




I will depart and return to my place until they recognize their guilt and seek my face; they will search for me in their distress. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Hosea 7

***










###### 1 




when I heal Israel, the iniquity of Ephraim and the crimes of Samaria will be exposed. For they practice fraud; a thief breaks in; a raiding party pillages outside. 









###### 2 




But they never consider that I remember all their evil. Now their actions are all around them; they are right in front of my face. ## Israel's Corruption 









###### 3 




They please the king with their evil, the princes with their lies. 









###### 4 




All of them commit adultery; they are like an oven heated by a baker who stops stirring the fire from the kneading of the dough until it is leavened. 









###### 5 




On the day of our king, the princes are sick with the heat of wine-- there is a conspiracy with traitors.[^a] 









###### 6 




For they--their hearts like an oven-- draw him into their oven. Their anger smolders all night; in the morning it blazes like a flaming fire. 









###### 7 




All of them are as hot as an oven, and they consume their rulers. All their kings fall; not one of them calls on me.[^b] 









###### 8 




Ephraim has allowed himself to get mixed up with the nations. Ephraim is unturned bread baked on a griddle. 









###### 9 




Foreigners consume his strength, but he does not notice. Even his hair is streaked with gray, but he does not notice. 









###### 10 




Israel's arrogance testifies against them,[^c] yet they do not return to the Lord their God, and for all this, they do not seek him. 









###### 11 




So Ephraim has become like a silly, senseless dove; they call to Egypt, and they go to Assyria. 









###### 12 




As they are going, I will spread my net over them; I will bring them down like birds of the sky. I will discipline them in accordance with the news that reaches[^d] their assembly. ## The Lord's Second Lament 









###### 13 




Woe to them, for they fled from me; destruction to them, for they rebelled against me! Though I want to redeem them, they speak lies against me. 









###### 14 




They do not cry to me from their hearts; rather, they wail on their beds. They slash themselves[^e] for grain and new wine; they turn away from me. 









###### 15 




I trained and strengthened their arms, but they plot evil against me. 









###### 16 




They turn, but not to what is above;[^f] they are like a faulty bow. Their leaders will fall by the sword because of their insolent tongue. They will be ridiculed for this in the land of Egypt. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Hosea 9

***










###### 1 




Israel, do not rejoice jubilantly as the nations do, for you have acted promiscuously, leaving your God. You love the wages of a prostitute on every grain-threshing floor. 









###### 2 




Threshing floor and wine vat will not sustain them, and the new wine will fail them. 









###### 3 




They will not stay in the land of the Lord. Instead, Ephraim will return to Egypt, and they will eat unclean food in Assyria. 









###### 4 




They will not pour out their wine offerings to the Lord, and their sacrifices will not please him. Their food will be like the bread of mourners; all who eat it become defiled. For their bread will be for their appetites alone; it will not enter the house of the Lord. 









###### 5 




What will you do on a festival day, on the day of the Lord's feast? 









###### 6 




For even if they flee from devastation, Egypt will gather them, and Memphis will bury them. Thistles will take possession of their precious silver; thorns will invade their tents. 









###### 7 




The days of punishment have come; the days of retribution have come. Let Israel recognize it! The prophet is a fool, and the inspired man is insane, because of the magnitude of your iniquity and hostility. 









###### 8 




Ephraim's watchman is with my God. Yet the prophet encounters a bird trap on all his pathways. Hostility is in the house of his God! 









###### 9 




They have deeply corrupted themselves as in the days of Gibeah. He will remember their iniquity; he will punish their sins. ## Ephraim Bereaved of Offspring 









###### 10 




I discovered Israel like grapes in the wilderness. I saw your ancestors like the first fruit of the fig tree in its first season. But they went to Baal-peor, consecrated themselves to Shame,[^a] and became abhorrent, like the thing they loved. 









###### 11 




Ephraim's glory will fly away like a bird: no birth, no pregnancy, no conception. 









###### 12 




Even if they raise children, I will bereave them of each one. Yes, woe to them when I depart from them! 









###### 13 




I have seen Ephraim like Tyre, planted in a meadow, so Ephraim will bring out his children to the executioner. 









###### 14 




Give them, Lord-- What should you give? Give them a womb that miscarries and breasts that are dry! 









###### 15 




All their evil appears at Gilgal, for there I began to hate them. I will drive them from my house because of their evil, wicked actions. I will no longer love them; all their leaders are rebellious. 









###### 16 




Ephraim is struck down; their roots are withered; they cannot bear fruit. Even if they bear children, I will kill the precious offspring of their wombs. 









###### 17 




My God will reject them because they have not listened to him; they will become wanderers among the nations. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

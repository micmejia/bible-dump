# Isaiah 15

***










###### 1 




A pronouncement concerning Moab: Ar in Moab is devastated, destroyed in a night. Kir in Moab is devastated, destroyed in a night. 









###### 2 




Dibon went up to its temple to weep at its high places. Moab wails on Nebo and at[^a] Medeba. Every head is shaved; every beard is chopped short. 









###### 3 




In its streets they wear sackcloth; on its rooftops and in its public squares everyone wails, falling down and weeping. 









###### 4 




Heshbon and Elealeh cry out; their voices are heard as far away as Jahaz. Therefore the soldiers of Moab cry out, and they tremble. 









###### 5 




My heart cries out over Moab, whose fugitives flee as far as Zoar, to Eglath-shelishiyah; they go up the Ascent of Luhith weeping; they raise a cry of destruction on the road to Horonaim. 









###### 6 




The Waters of Nimrim are desolate; the grass is withered, the foliage is gone, and the vegetation has vanished. 









###### 7 




So they carry their wealth and belongings over the Wadi of the Willows. 









###### 8 




For their cry echoes throughout the territory of Moab. Their wailing reaches Eglaim; their wailing reaches Beer-elim. 









###### 9 




The Waters of Dibon[^b] are full of blood, but I will bring on Dibon even more than this-- a lion for those who escape from Moab, and for the survivors in the land. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

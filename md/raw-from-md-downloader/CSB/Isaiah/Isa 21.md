# Isaiah 21

***










###### 1 




A pronouncement concerning the desert by the sea: Like storms that pass over the Negev, it comes from the desert, from the land of terror. 









###### 2 




A troubling vision is declared to me: "The treacherous one acts treacherously, and the destroyer destroys. Advance, Elam! Lay siege, you Medes! I will put an end to all the groaning." 









###### 3 




Therefore I am[^a] filled with anguish. Pain grips me, like the pain of a woman in labor. I am too perplexed to hear, too dismayed to see. 









###### 4 




My heart staggers; horror terrifies me. He has turned my last glimmer of hope[^b] into sheer terror. 









###### 5 




Prepare a table, and spread out a carpet! Eat and drink! Rise up, you princes, and oil the shields! 









###### 6 




For the Lord has said to me, "Go, post a lookout; let him report what he sees. 









###### 7 




When he sees riders-- pairs of horsemen, riders on donkeys, riders on camels-- he must pay close attention." 









###### 8 




Then the lookout[^c] reported, "Lord, I stand on the watchtower all day, and I stay at my post all night. 









###### 9 




Look, riders come-- horsemen in pairs." And he answered, saying, "Babylon has fallen, has fallen. All the images of her gods have been shattered on the ground." 









###### 10 




My people who have been crushed on the threshing floor, I have declared to you what I have heard from the Lord of Armies, the God of Israel. ## A Pronouncement against Dumah 









###### 11 




A pronouncement concerning Dumah:[^d] One calls to me from Seir, "Watchman, what is left of the night? Watchman, what is left of the night?" 









###### 12 




The watchman said, "Morning has come, and also night. If you want to ask, ask! Come back again." ## A Pronouncement against Arabia 









###### 13 




A pronouncement concerning Arabia: In the desert[^e] brush you will camp for the night, you caravans of Dedanites. 









###### 14 




Bring water for the thirsty. The inhabitants of the land of Tema meet[^f] the refugees with food. 









###### 15 




For they have fled from swords, from the drawn sword, from the bow that is strung, and from the stress of battle. 









###### 16 




For the Lord said this to me: "Within one year, as a hired worker counts years, all the glory of Kedar will be gone. 









###### 17 




The remaining Kedarite archers will be few in number." For the Lord, the God of Israel, has spoken. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

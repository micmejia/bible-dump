# Isaiah 25

***










###### 1 




Lord, you are my God; I will exalt you. I will praise your name, for you have accomplished wonders, plans formed long ago, with perfect faithfulness. 









###### 2 




For you have turned the city into a pile of rocks, a fortified city, into ruins; the fortress of barbarians is no longer a city; it will never be rebuilt. 









###### 3 




Therefore, a strong people will honor you. The cities of violent nations will fear you. 









###### 4 




For you have been a stronghold for the poor person, a stronghold for the needy in his distress, a refuge from storms and a shade from heat. When the breath of the violent is like a storm against a wall, 









###### 5 




like heat in a dry land, you will subdue the uproar of barbarians. As the shade of a cloud cools the heat of the day, so he will silence the song of the violent. 









###### 6 




On this mountain,[^a] the Lord of Armies will prepare for all the peoples a feast of choice meat, a feast with aged wine, prime cuts of choice meat,[^b] fine vintage wine. 









###### 7 




On this mountain he will swallow up the burial shroud, the shroud over all the peoples, the sheet covering all the nations. 









###### 8 




When he has swallowed up death once and for all, the Lord God will wipe away the tears from every face and remove his people's disgrace from the whole earth, for the Lord has spoken. 









###### 9 




On that day it will be said, "Look, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he has saved us. This is the Lord; we have waited for him. Let's rejoice and be glad in his salvation." 









###### 10 




For the Lord's power will rest on this mountain. But Moab will be trampled in his place[^c] as straw is trampled in a dung pile. 









###### 11 




He will spread out his arms in the middle of it, as a swimmer spreads out his arms to swim. His pride will be brought low, along with the trickery of his hands. 









###### 12 




The high-walled fortress will be brought down, thrown to the ground, to the dust. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

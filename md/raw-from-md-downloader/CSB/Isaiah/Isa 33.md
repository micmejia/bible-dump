# Isaiah 33

***










###### 1 




Woe, you destroyer never destroyed, you traitor never betrayed! When you have finished destroying, you will be destroyed. When you have finished betraying, they will betray you. 









###### 2 




Lord, be gracious to us! We wait for you. Be our strength every morning and our salvation in time of trouble. 









###### 3 




The peoples flee at the thunderous noise; the nations scatter when you rise in your majesty. 









###### 4 




Your spoil will be gathered as locusts are gathered; people will swarm over it like an infestation of locusts. 









###### 5 




The Lord is exalted, for he dwells on high; he has filled Zion with justice and righteousness. 









###### 6 




There will be times of security for you-- a storehouse of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge. The fear of the Lord is Zion's treasure. 









###### 7 




Listen! Their warriors cry loudly in the streets; the messengers of peace weep bitterly. 









###### 8 




The highways are deserted; travel has ceased. An agreement has been broken, cities[^a] despised, and human life disregarded. 









###### 9 




The land mourns and withers; Lebanon is ashamed and wilted. Sharon is like a desert; Bashan and Carmel shake off their leaves. 









###### 10 




"Now I will rise up," says the Lord. "Now I will lift myself up. Now I will be exalted. 









###### 11 




You will conceive chaff; you will give birth to stubble. Your breath is fire that will consume you. 









###### 12 




The peoples will be burned to ashes, like thorns cut down and burned in a fire. 









###### 13 




You who are far off, hear what I have done; you who are near, know my strength." 









###### 14 




The sinners in Zion are afraid; trembling seizes the ungodly: "Who among us can dwell with a consuming fire? Who among us can dwell with ever-burning flames?" 









###### 15 




The one who lives righteously and speaks rightly, who refuses profit from extortion, whose hand never takes a bribe, who stops his ears from listening to murderous plots and shuts his eyes against evil schemes-- 









###### 16 




he will dwell on the heights; his refuge will be the rocky fortresses, his food provided, his water assured. 









###### 17 




Your eyes will see the King in his beauty; you will see a vast land. 









###### 18 




Your mind will meditate on the past terror: "Where is the accountant?[^b] Where is the tribute collector?[^c] Where is the one who spied out our defenses?" [^d] 









###### 19 




You will no longer see the barbarians, a people whose speech is difficult to comprehend-- who stammer in a language that is not understood. 









###### 20 




Look at Zion, the city of our festival times. Your eyes will see Jerusalem, a peaceful pasture, a tent that does not wander; its tent pegs will not be pulled up nor will any of its cords be loosened. 









###### 21 




For the majestic one, our Lord, will be there, a place of rivers and broad streams where ships that are rowed will not go, and majestic vessels will not pass. 









###### 22 




For the Lord is our Judge, the Lord is our Lawgiver, the Lord is our King. He will save us. 









###### 23 




Your ropes are slack; they cannot hold the base of the mast or spread out the flag. Then abundant spoil will be divided, the lame will plunder it, 









###### 24 




and none there will say, "I am sick." The people who dwell there will be forgiven their iniquity. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Isaiah 34

***










###### 1 




You nations, come here and listen; you peoples, pay attention! Let the earth and all that fills it hear, the world and all that comes from it. 









###### 2 




The Lord is angry with all the nations, furious with all their armies. He will set them apart for destruction, giving them over to slaughter. 









###### 3 




Their slain will be thrown out, and the stench of their corpses will rise; the mountains will flow[^a] with their blood. 









###### 4 




All[^b] the stars in the sky will dissolve. The sky will roll up like a scroll, and its stars will all wither as leaves wither on the vine, and foliage on the fig tree. ## The Judgment of Edom 









###### 5 




When my sword has drunk its fill[^c] in the heavens, it will then come down on Edom and on the people I have set apart for destruction. 









###### 6 




The Lord's sword is covered with blood. It drips with fat, with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams. For the Lord has a sacrifice in Bozrah, a great slaughter in the land of Edom. 









###### 7 




The wild oxen will be struck[^d] down with them, and young bulls with the mighty bulls. Their land will be soaked with[^e] blood, and their soil will be saturated with fat. 









###### 8 




For the Lord has a day of vengeance, a time of paying back Edom for its hostility against Zion. 









###### 9 




Edom's streams will be turned into pitch, her soil into sulfur; her land will become burning pitch. 









###### 10 




It will never go out--day or night. Its smoke will go up forever. It will be desolate, from generation to generation; no one will pass through it forever and ever. 









###### 11 




Eagle owls[^f] and herons[^g] will possess it, and long-eared owls and ravens will dwell there. The Lord will stretch out a measuring line and a plumb line over her for her destruction and chaos. 









###### 12 




No nobles will be left to proclaim a king, and all her princes will come to nothing. 









###### 13 




Her palaces will be overgrown with thorns; her fortified cities, with thistles and briers. She will become a dwelling for jackals, an abode[^h] for ostriches. 









###### 14 




The desert creatures will meet hyenas, and one wild goat will call to another. Indeed, the night birds will stay there and will find a resting place. 









###### 15 




Sand partridges[^i] will make their nests there; they will lay and hatch their eggs and will gather their broods under their shadows. Indeed, the birds of prey will gather there, each with its mate. 









###### 16 




Search and read the scroll of the Lord: Not one of them will be missing, none will be lacking its mate, because he has ordered it by my[^j] mouth, and he will gather them by his Spirit. 









###### 17 




He has cast the lot for them; his hand allotted their portion with a measuring line. They will possess it forever; they will dwell in it from generation to generation. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

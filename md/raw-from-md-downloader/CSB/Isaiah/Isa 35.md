# Isaiah 35

***










###### 1 




The wilderness and the dry land will be glad; the desert will rejoice and blossom like a wildflower.[^a] 









###### 2 




It will blossom abundantly and will also rejoice with joy and singing. The glory of Lebanon will be given to it, the splendor of Carmel and Sharon. They will see the glory of the Lord, the splendor of our God. 









###### 3 




Strengthen the weak hands, steady the shaking knees! 









###### 4 




Say to the cowardly: "Be strong; do not fear! Here is your God; vengeance is coming. God's retribution is coming; he will save you." 









###### 5 




Then the eyes of the blind will be opened, and the ears of the deaf unstopped. 









###### 6 




Then the lame will leap like a deer, and the tongue of the mute will sing for joy, for water will gush in the wilderness, and streams in the desert; 









###### 7 




the parched ground will become a pool, and the thirsty land, springs. In the haunt of jackals, in their lairs, there will be grass, reeds, and papyrus. 









###### 8 




A road will be there and a way; it will be called the Holy Way. The unclean will not travel on it, but it will be for the one who walks the path. Fools will not wander on it. 









###### 9 




There will be no lion there, and no vicious beast will go up on it; they will not be found there. But the redeemed will walk on it, 









###### 10 




and the ransomed of the Lord will return and come to Zion with singing, crowned with unending joy. Joy and gladness will overtake them, and sorrow and sighing will flee. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Isaiah 38

***










###### 1 




In those days Hezekiah became terminally ill. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz came and said to him, "This is what the Lord says: 'Set your house in order, for you are about to die; you will not recover.'"[^a] 









###### 2 




Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord. 









###### 3 




He said, "Please, Lord, remember how I have walked before you faithfully and wholeheartedly, and have done what pleases you." And Hezekiah wept bitterly. 









###### 4 




Then the word of the Lord came to Isaiah: 









###### 5 




"Go and tell Hezekiah, 'This is what the Lord God of your ancestor David says: I have heard your prayer; I have seen your tears. Look, I am going to add fifteen years to your life.[^b] 









###### 6 




And I will rescue you and this city from the grasp of the king of Assyria; I will defend this city. 









###### 7 




This is the sign to you from the Lord that he will do what he has promised: 









###### 8 




I am going to make the sun's shadow that goes down on the stairway of Ahaz go back by ten steps.'" So the sun's shadow[^c] went back the ten steps it had descended. 









###### 9 




A poem by King Hezekiah of Judah after he had been sick and had recovered from his illness: 









###### 10 




I said: In the prime[^d] of my life I must go to the gates of Sheol; I am deprived of the rest of my years. 









###### 11 




I said: I will never see the Lord, the Lord in the land of the living; I will not look on humanity any longer with the inhabitants of what is passing away.[^e] 









###### 12 




My dwelling is plucked up and removed from me like a shepherd's tent. I have rolled up my life like a weaver; he cuts me off from the loom. By nightfall[^f] you make an end of me. 









###### 13 




I thought until the morning: He will break all my bones like a lion. By nightfall you make an end of me. 









###### 14 




I chirp like a swallow or a crane; I moan like a dove. My eyes grow weak looking upward. Lord, I am oppressed; support me. 









###### 15 




What can I say? He has spoken to me, and he himself has done it. I walk along slowly all my years because of the bitterness of my soul. 









###### 16 




Lord, by such things people live, and in every one of them my spirit finds life; you have restored me to health and let me live. 









###### 17 




Indeed, it was for my own well-being that I had such intense bitterness; but your love has delivered me from the Pit of destruction, for you have thrown all my sins behind your back. 









###### 18 




For Sheol cannot thank you; Death cannot praise you. Those who go down to the Pit cannot hope for your faithfulness. 









###### 19 




The living, only the living can thank you, as I do today; a father will make your faithfulness known to children. 









###### 20 




The Lord is ready to save me; we will play stringed instruments all the days of our lives at the house of the Lord. 









###### 21 




Now Isaiah had said, "Let them take a lump of pressed figs and apply it to his infected skin, so that he may recover." 









###### 22 




And Hezekiah had asked, "What is the sign that I will go up to the Lord's temple?" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

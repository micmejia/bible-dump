# Isaiah 46

***










###### 1 




Bel crouches; Nebo cowers. Idols depicting them are consigned to beasts and cattle. The images you carry are loaded, as a burden for the weary animal. 









###### 2 




The gods cower; they crouch together; they are not able to rescue the burden, but they themselves go into captivity. 









###### 3 




"Listen to me, house of Jacob, all the remnant of the house of Israel, who have been sustained from the womb, carried along since birth. 









###### 4 




I will be the same until your old age, and I will bear you up when you turn gray. I have made you, and I will carry you; I will bear and rescue you. 









###### 5 




"To whom will you compare me or make me equal? Who will you measure me with, so that we should be like each other? 









###### 6 




Those who pour out their bags of gold and weigh out silver on scales-- they hire a goldsmith and he makes it into a god. Then they kneel and bow down to it. 









###### 7 




They lift it to their shoulder and bear it along; they set it in its place, and there it stands; it does not budge from its place. They cry out to it but it doesn't answer; it saves no one from his trouble. 









###### 8 




"Remember this and be brave;[^a] take it to heart, you transgressors! 









###### 9 




Remember what happened long ago, for I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and no one is like me. 









###### 10 




I declare the end from the beginning, and from long ago what is not yet done, saying: my plan will take place, and I will do all my will. 









###### 11 




I call a bird of prey[^b] from the east, a man for my purpose from a far country. Yes, I have spoken; so I will also bring it about. I have planned it; I will also do it. 









###### 12 




Listen to me, you hardhearted, far removed from justice: 









###### 13 




I am bringing my justice near; it is not far away, and my salvation will not delay. I will put salvation in Zion, my splendor in Israel. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Isaiah 50

***










###### 1 




This is what the Lord says: Where is your mother's divorce certificate that I used to send her away? Or to which of my creditors did I sell you? Look, you were sold for your iniquities, and your mother was sent away because of your transgressions. 









###### 2 




Why was no one there when I came? Why was there no one to answer when I called? Is my arm too weak to redeem? Or do I have no power to rescue? Look, I dry up the sea by my rebuke; I turn the rivers into a wilderness; their fish rot because of lack of water and die of thirst. 









###### 3 




I dress the heavens in black and make sackcloth their covering. ## The Obedient Servant 









###### 4 




The Lord God has given me the tongue of those who are instructed to know how to sustain the weary with a word. He awakens me each morning; he awakens my ear to listen like those being instructed. 









###### 5 




The Lord God has opened my ear, and I was not rebellious; I did not turn back. 









###### 6 




I gave my back to those who beat me, and my cheeks to those who tore out my beard. I did not hide my face from scorn and spitting. 









###### 7 




The Lord God will help me; therefore I have not been humiliated; therefore I have set my face like flint, and I know I will not be put to shame. 









###### 8 




The one who vindicates me is near; who will contend with me? Let us confront each other.[^a] Who has a case against me?[^b] Let him come near me! 









###### 9 




In truth, the Lord God will help me; who will condemn me? Indeed, all of them will wear out like a garment; a moth will devour them. 









###### 10 




Who among you fears the Lord and listens to his servant? Who among you walks in darkness, and has no light? Let him trust in the name of the Lord; let him lean on his God. 









###### 11 




Look, all you who kindle a fire, who encircle yourselves with[^c] torches; walk in the light of your fire and of the torches you have lit! This is what you'll get from my hand: you will lie down in a place of torment. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

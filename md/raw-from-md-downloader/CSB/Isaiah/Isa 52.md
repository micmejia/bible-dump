# Isaiah 52

***










###### 1 




"Wake up, wake up; put on your strength, Zion! Put on your beautiful garments, Jerusalem, the holy city! For the uncircumcised and the unclean will no longer enter you. 









###### 2 




Stand up, shake the dust off yourself! Take your seat, Jerusalem. Remove the bonds[^a] from your neck, captive Daughter Zion." 









###### 3 




For this is what the Lord says: "You were sold for nothing, and you will be redeemed without silver." 









###### 4 




For this is what the Lord God says: "At first my people went down to Egypt to reside there, then Assyria oppressed them without cause.[^b] 









###### 5 




So now what have I here"-- this is the Lord's declaration-- "that my people are taken away for nothing? Its rulers wail"-- this is the Lord's declaration-- "and my name is continually blasphemed all day long. 









###### 6 




Therefore my people will know my name; therefore they will know on that day that I am he who says, 'Here I am.'" 









###### 7 




How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of the herald, who proclaims peace, who brings news of good things, who proclaims salvation, who says to Zion, "Your God reigns!" 









###### 8 




The voices of your watchmen-- they lift up their voices, shouting for joy together; for every eye will see when the Lord returns to Zion. 









###### 9 




Be joyful, rejoice together, you ruins of Jerusalem! For the Lord has comforted his people; he has redeemed Jerusalem. 









###### 10 




The Lord has displayed his holy arm in the sight of all the nations; all the ends of the earth will see the salvation of our God. 









###### 11 




Leave, leave, go out from there! Do not touch anything unclean; go out from her, purify yourselves, you who carry the vessels of the Lord. 









###### 12 




For you will not leave in a hurry, and you will not have to take flight; because the Lord is going before you, and the God of Israel is your rear guard. ## The Servant's Suffering and Exaltation 









###### 13 




See, my servant[^c] will be successful;[^d] he will be raised and lifted up and greatly exalted. 









###### 14 




Just as many were appalled at you[^e]-- his appearance was so disfigured that he did not look like a man, and his form did not resemble a human being-- 









###### 15 




so he will sprinkle many nations.[^f] Kings will shut their mouths because of him, for they will see what had not been told them, and they will understand what they had not heard. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

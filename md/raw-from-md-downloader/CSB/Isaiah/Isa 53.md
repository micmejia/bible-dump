# Isaiah 53

***










###### 1 




Who has believed what we have heard?[^a] And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed? 









###### 2 




He grew up before him like a young plant and like a root out of dry ground. He didn't have an impressive form or majesty that we should look at him, no appearance that we should desire him. 









###### 3 




He was despised and rejected by men, a man of suffering who knew what sickness was. He was like someone people turned away from;[^b] he was despised, and we didn't value him. 









###### 4 




Yet he himself bore our sicknesses, and he carried our pains; but we in turn regarded him stricken, struck down by God, and afflicted. 









###### 5 




But he was pierced because of our rebellion, crushed because of our iniquities; punishment for our peace was on him, and we are healed by his wounds. 









###### 6 




We all went astray like sheep; we all have turned to our own way; and the Lord has punished him for[^c] the iniquity of us all. 









###### 7 




He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth. Like a lamb led to the slaughter and like a sheep silent before her shearers, he did not open his mouth. 









###### 8 




He was taken away because of oppression and judgment, and who considered his fate?[^d] For he was cut off from the land of the living; he was struck because of my people's rebellion. 









###### 9 




He was assigned a grave with the wicked, but he was with a rich man at his death, because he had done no violence and had not spoken deceitfully. 









###### 10 




Yet the Lord was pleased to crush him severely.[^e] When[^f] you make him a guilt offering, he will see his seed, he will prolong his days, and by his hand, the Lord's pleasure will be accomplished. 









###### 11 




After his anguish, he will see light[^g] and be satisfied. By his knowledge, my righteous servant will justify many, and he will carry their iniquities. 









###### 12 




Therefore I will give him[^h] the many as a portion, and he will receive[^i] the mighty as spoil, because he willingly submitted to death, and was counted among the rebels; yet he bore the sin of many and interceded for the rebels. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Isaiah 54

***










###### 1 




"Rejoice, childless one, who did not give birth; burst into song and shout, you who have not been in labor! For the children of the desolate one will be more than the children of the married woman," says the Lord. 









###### 2 




"Enlarge the site of your tent, and let your tent curtains be stretched out; do not hold back; lengthen your ropes, and drive your pegs deep. 









###### 3 




For you will spread out to the right and to the left, and your descendants will dispossess nations and inhabit the desolate cities. 









###### 4 




"Do not be afraid, for you will not be put to shame; don't be humiliated, for you will not be disgraced. For you will forget the shame of your youth, and you will no longer remember the disgrace of your widowhood. 









###### 5 




Indeed, your husband is your Maker-- his name is the Lord of Armies-- and the Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer; he is called the God of the whole earth. 









###### 6 




For the Lord has called you, like a wife deserted and wounded in spirit, a wife of one's youth when she is rejected," says your God. 









###### 7 




"I deserted you for a brief moment, but I will take you back with abundant compassion. 









###### 8 




In a surge of anger I hid my face from you for a moment, but I will have compassion on you with everlasting love," says the Lord your Redeemer. 









###### 9 




"For this is like the days[^a] of Noah to me: when I swore that the water of Noah would never flood the earth again, so I have sworn that I will not be angry with you or rebuke you. 









###### 10 




Though the mountains move and the hills shake, my love will not be removed from you and my covenant of peace will not be shaken," says your compassionate Lord. 









###### 11 




"Poor Jerusalem, storm-tossed, and not comforted, I will set your stones in black mortar,[^b] and lay your foundations in lapis lazuli. 









###### 12 




I will make your fortifications[^c] out of rubies, your gates out of sparkling stones, and all your walls out of precious stones. 









###### 13 




Then all your children will be taught by the Lord, their prosperity will be great, 









###### 14 




and you will be established on a foundation of righteousness. You will be far from oppression, you will certainly not be afraid; you will be far from terror, it will certainly not come near you. 









###### 15 




If anyone attacks you, it is not from me; whoever attacks you will fall before you. 









###### 16 




Look, I have created the craftsman who blows on the charcoal fire and produces a weapon suitable for its task; and I have created the destroyer to cause havoc. 









###### 17 




No weapon formed against you will succeed, and you will refute any accusation[^d] raised against you in court. This is the heritage of the Lord's servants, and their vindication is from me." This is the Lord's declaration. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

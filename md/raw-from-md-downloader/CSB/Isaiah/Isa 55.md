# Isaiah 55

***










###### 1 




"Come, everyone who is thirsty, come to the water; and you without silver, come, buy, and eat! Come, buy wine and milk without silver and without cost! 









###### 2 




Why do you spend silver on what is not food, and your wages on what does not satisfy? Listen carefully to me, and eat what is good, and you will enjoy the choicest of foods.[^a] 









###### 3 




Pay attention and come to me; listen, so that you will live. I will make a permanent covenant with you on the basis of the faithful kindnesses of David.[^b] 









###### 4 




Since I have made him a witness to the peoples, a leader and commander for the peoples, 









###### 5 




so you will summon a nation you do not know, and nations who do not know you will run to you. For the Lord your God, even the Holy One of Israel, has glorified you." 









###### 6 




Seek the Lord while he may be found; call to him while he is near. 









###### 7 




Let the wicked one abandon his way and the sinful one his thoughts; let him return to the Lord, so he may have compassion on him, and to our God, for he will freely forgive. 









###### 8 




"For my thoughts are not your thoughts, and your ways are not my ways." This is the Lord's declaration. 









###### 9 




"For as heaven is higher than earth, so my ways are higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts. 









###### 10 




For just as rain and snow fall from heaven and do not return there without saturating the earth and making it germinate and sprout, and providing seed to sow and food to eat, 









###### 11 




so my word that comes from my mouth will not return to me empty, but it will accomplish what I please and will prosper in what I send it to do." 









###### 12 




You will indeed go out with joy and be peacefully guided; the mountains and the hills will break into singing before you, and all the trees of the field will clap their hands. 









###### 13 




Instead of the thornbush, a cypress will come up, and instead of the brier, a myrtle will come up; this will stand as a monument for the Lord, an everlasting sign that will not be destroyed. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

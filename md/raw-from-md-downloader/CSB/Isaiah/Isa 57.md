# Isaiah 57

***










###### 1 




The righteous person perishes, and no one takes it to heart; the faithful are taken away, with no one realizing that the righteous person is taken away because of[^a] evil. 









###### 2 




He will enter into peace-- they will rest on their beds[^b]-- everyone who lives uprightly. ## Pagan Religion Denounced 









###### 3 




But come here, you witch's sons, offspring of an adulterer and a prostitute![^c] 









###### 4 




Who are you mocking? Who are you opening your mouth and sticking out your tongue at? Isn't it you, you rebellious children, you offspring of liars, 









###### 5 




who burn with lust among the oaks, under every green tree, who slaughter children in the wadis below the clefts of the rocks? 









###### 6 




Your portion is among the smooth stones of the wadi; indeed, they are your lot. You have even poured out a drink offering to them; you have offered a grain offering; should I be satisfied with these? 









###### 7 




You have placed your bed on a high and lofty mountain; you also went up there to offer sacrifice. 









###### 8 




You have set up your memorial behind the door and doorpost. For away from me, you stripped, went up, and made your bed wide, and you have made a bargain[^d] for yourself with them. You have loved their bed; you have gazed on their genitals.[^e][^f] 









###### 9 




You went to the king with oil and multiplied your perfumes; you sent your envoys far away and sent them down even to Sheol. 









###### 10 




You became weary on your many journeys, but you did not say, "It's hopeless!" You found a renewal of your strength;[^g] therefore you did not grow weak. 









###### 11 




Who was it you dreaded and feared, so that you lied and didn't remember me or take it to heart? I have kept silent for a long time, haven't I?[^h] So you do not fear me. 









###### 12 




I will announce your righteousness, and your works--they will not profit you. 









###### 13 




When you cry out, let your collection of idols rescue you! The wind will carry all of them off, a breath will take them away. But whoever takes refuge in me will inherit the land and possess my holy mountain. ## Healing and Peace 









###### 14 




He said, "Build it up, build it up, prepare the way, remove every obstacle from my people's way." 









###### 15 




For the High and Exalted One, who lives forever, whose name is holy, says this: "I live in a high and holy place, and with the oppressed and lowly of spirit, to revive the spirit of the lowly and revive the heart of the oppressed. 









###### 16 




For I will not accuse you forever, and I will not always be angry; for then the spirit would grow weak before me, even the breath, which I have made. 









###### 17 




Because of his sinful greed I was angry, so I struck him; I was angry and hid; but he went on turning back to the desires of his heart. 









###### 18 




I have seen his ways, but I will heal him; I will lead him and restore comfort to him and his mourners, 









###### 19 




creating words of praise."[^i] The Lord says, "Peace, peace to the one who is far or near, and I will heal him. 









###### 20 




But the wicked are like the storm-tossed sea, for it cannot be still, and its water churns up mire and muck. 









###### 21 




There is no peace for the wicked," says my God. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

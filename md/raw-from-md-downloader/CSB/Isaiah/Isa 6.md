# Isaiah 6

***










###### 1 




In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord seated on a high and lofty throne, and the hem of his robe filled the temple. 









###### 2 




Seraphim[^a] were standing above him; they each had six wings: with two they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they flew. 









###### 3 




And one called to another: Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Armies; his glory fills the whole earth. 









###### 4 




The foundations of the doorways shook at the sound of their voices, and the temple was filled with smoke. 









###### 5 




Then I said: Woe is me for I am ruined[^b] because I am a man of unclean lips and live among a people of unclean lips, and because my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of Armies. 









###### 6 




Then one of the seraphim flew to me, and in his hand was a glowing coal that he had taken from the altar with tongs. 









###### 7 




He touched my mouth with it and said: Now that this has touched your lips, your iniquity is removed and your sin is atoned for. 









###### 8 




Then I heard the voice of the Lord asking: Who will I send? Who will go for us? I said: Here I am. Send me. 









###### 9 




And he replied: Go! Say to these people: Keep listening, but do not understand; keep looking, but do not perceive. 









###### 10 




Make the minds[^c] of these people dull; deafen their ears and blind their eyes; otherwise they might see with their eyes and hear with their ears, understand with their minds, turn back, and be healed. 









###### 11 




Then I said, "Until when, Lord?" And he replied: Until cities lie in ruins without inhabitants, houses are without people, the land is ruined and desolate, 









###### 12 




and the Lord drives the people far away, leaving great emptiness in the land. 









###### 13 




Though a tenth will remain in the land, it will be burned again. Like the terebinth or the oak that leaves a stump when felled, the holy seed is the stump. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

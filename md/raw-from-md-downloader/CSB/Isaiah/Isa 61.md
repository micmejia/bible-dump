# Isaiah 61

***










###### 1 




The Spirit of the Lord God is on me, because the Lord has anointed me to bring good news to the poor. He has sent me to heal[^a] the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives and freedom to the prisoners; 









###### 2 




to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor, and the day of our God's vengeance; to comfort all who mourn, 









###### 3 




to provide for those who mourn in Zion; to give them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, festive oil instead of mourning, and splendid clothes instead of despair.[^b] And they will be called righteous trees, planted by the Lord to glorify him. 









###### 4 




They will rebuild the ancient ruins; they will restore the former devastations; they will renew the ruined cities, the devastations of many generations. 









###### 5 




Strangers will stand and feed your flocks, and foreigners will be your plowmen and vinedressers. 









###### 6 




But you will be called the Lord's priests; they will speak of you as ministers of our God; you will eat the wealth of the nations, and you will boast in their riches. 









###### 7 




In place of your shame, you will have a double portion; in place of disgrace, they will rejoice over their share. So they will possess double in their land, and eternal joy will be theirs. 









###### 8 




For I the Lord love justice; I hate robbery and injustice;[^c] I will faithfully reward my people and make a permanent covenant with them. 









###### 9 




Their descendants will be known among the nations, and their posterity among the peoples. All who see them will recognize that they are a people the Lord has blessed. 









###### 10 




I rejoice greatly in the Lord, I exult in my God; for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation and wrapped me in a robe of righteousness, as a groom wears a turban and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels. 









###### 11 




For as the earth produces its growth, and as a garden enables what is sown to spring up, so the Lord God will cause righteousness and praise to spring up before all the nations. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Isaiah 62

***










###### 1 




I will not keep silent because of Zion, and I will not keep still because of Jerusalem, until her righteousness shines like a bright light and her salvation, like a flaming torch. 









###### 2 




Nations will see your righteousness and all kings, your glory. You will be given a new name that the Lord's mouth will announce. 









###### 3 




You will be a glorious crown in the Lord's hand, and a royal diadem in the palm of your God's hand. 









###### 4 




You will no longer be called Deserted, and your land will not be called Desolate; instead, you will be called My Delight Is in Her,[^a] and your land Married;[^b] for the Lord delights in you, and your land will be married. 









###### 5 




For as a young man marries a young woman, so your sons will marry you; and as a groom rejoices over his bride, so your God will rejoice over you. 









###### 6 




Jerusalem, I have appointed watchmen on your walls; they will never be silent, day or night. There is no rest for you, who remind the Lord. 









###### 7 




Do not give him rest until he establishes and makes Jerusalem the praise of the earth. 









###### 8 




The Lord has sworn with his right hand and his strong arm: I will no longer give your grain to your enemies for food, and foreigners will not drink the new wine for which you have labored. 









###### 9 




For those who gather grain will eat it and praise the Lord, and those who harvest the grapes will drink the wine in my holy courts. 









###### 10 




Go out, go out through the city gates; prepare a way for the people! Build it up, build up the highway; clear away the stones! Raise a banner for the peoples. 









###### 11 




Look, the Lord has proclaimed to the ends of the earth, "Say to Daughter Zion: Look, your salvation is coming, his wages are with him, and his reward accompanies him." 









###### 12 




And they will be called[^c] the Holy People, the Lord's Redeemed; and you will be called Cared For, A City Not Deserted. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

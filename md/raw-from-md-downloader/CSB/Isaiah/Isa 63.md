# Isaiah 63

***










###### 1 




Who is this coming from Edom in crimson-stained garments from Bozrah-- this one who is splendid in his apparel, striding in his formidable[^a] might? It is I, proclaiming vindication,[^b] powerful to save. 









###### 2 




Why are your clothes red, and your garments like one who treads a winepress? 









###### 3 




I trampled the winepress alone, and no one from the nations was with me. I trampled them in my anger and ground them underfoot in my fury; their blood spattered my garments, and all my clothes were stained. 









###### 4 




For I planned the day of vengeance, and the year of my redemption[^c] came. 









###### 5 




I looked, but there was no one to help, and I was amazed that no one assisted; so my arm accomplished victory for me, and my wrath assisted me. 









###### 6 




I crushed nations in my anger; I made them drunk with my wrath and poured out their blood on the ground. ## Remembrance of Grace 









###### 7 




I will make known the Lord's faithful love and the Lord's praiseworthy acts, because of all the Lord has done for us-- even the many good things he has done for the house of Israel, which he did for them based on his compassion and the abundance of his faithful love. 









###### 8 




He said, "They are indeed my people, children who will not be disloyal," and he became their Savior. 









###### 9 




In all their suffering, he suffered,[^d] and the angel of his presence saved them. He redeemed them because of his love and compassion; he lifted them up and carried them all the days of the past. 









###### 10 




But they rebelled and grieved his Holy Spirit. So he became their enemy and fought against them. 









###### 11 




Then he[^e] remembered the days of the past, the days of Moses and his people. Where is he who brought them out of the sea with the shepherds[^f] of his flock? Where is he who put his Holy Spirit among the flock? 









###### 12 




He made his glorious strength available at the right hand of Moses, divided the water before them to make an eternal name for himself, 









###### 13 




and led them through the depths like a horse in the wilderness, so that they did not stumble. 









###### 14 




Like cattle that go down into the valley, the Spirit of the Lord gave them[^g] rest. You led your people this way to make a glorious name for yourself. ## Israel's Prayer 









###### 15 




Look down from heaven and see from your lofty home--holy and beautiful. Where is your zeal and your might? Your yearning[^h] and your compassion are withheld from me. 









###### 16 




Yet you are our Father, even though Abraham does not know us and Israel doesn't recognize us. You, Lord, are our Father; your name is Our Redeemer from Ancient Times. 









###### 17 




Why, Lord, do you make us stray from your ways? You harden our hearts so we do not fear[^i] you. Return, because of your servants, the tribes of your heritage. 









###### 18 




Your holy people had a possession[^j] for a little while, but our enemies have trampled down your sanctuary. 









###### 19

# Isaiah 64

***










###### 1 




If only you would tear the heavens open and come down, so that mountains would quake at your presence-- 









###### 2 




just as fire kindles brushwood, and fire boils water-- to make your name known to your enemies, so that nations would tremble at your presence! 









###### 3 




When you did awesome works that we did not expect, you came down, and the mountains quaked at your presence. 









###### 4 




From ancient times no one has heard, no one has listened to, no eye has seen any God except you who acts on behalf of the one who waits for him. 









###### 5 




You welcome the one who joyfully does what is right; they remember you in your ways. But we have sinned, and you were angry. How can we be saved if we remain in our sins?[^a] 









###### 6 




All of us have become like something unclean, and all our righteous acts are like a polluted[^b] garment; all of us wither like a leaf, and our iniquities carry us away like the wind. 









###### 7 




No one calls on your name, striving to take hold of you. For you have hidden your face from us and made us melt because of[^c][^d] our iniquity. 









###### 8 




Yet Lord, you are our Father; we are the clay, and you are our potter; we all are the work of your hands. 









###### 9 




Lord, do not be terribly angry or remember our iniquity forever. Please look--all of us are your people! 









###### 10 




Your holy cities have become a wilderness; Zion has become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation. 









###### 11 




Our holy and beautiful[^e] temple, where our ancestors praised you, has been burned down, and all that was dear to us lies in ruins. 









###### 12 




Lord, after all this, will you restrain yourself? Will you keep silent and afflict us severely? ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

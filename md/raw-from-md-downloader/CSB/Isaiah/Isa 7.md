# Isaiah 7

***










###### 1 




This took place during the reign of Ahaz, son of Jotham, son of Uzziah king of Judah: Aram's King Rezin and Israel's King Pekah son of Remaliah went to fight against Jerusalem, but they were not able to conquer it. 









###### 2 




When it became known to the house of David that Aram had occupied Ephraim, the heart of Ahaz[^a] and the hearts of his people trembled like trees of a forest shaking in the wind. 









###### 3 




The Lord said to Isaiah, "Go out with your son Shear-jashub[^b] to meet Ahaz at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, by the road to the Launderer's Field. 









###### 4 




Say to him: Calm down and be quiet. Don't be afraid or cowardly because of these two smoldering sticks, the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram, and the son of Remaliah. 









###### 5 




For Aram, along with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah, has plotted harm against you. They say, 









###### 6 




'Let's go up against Judah, terrorize it, and conquer it for ourselves. Then we can install Tabeel's son as king in it.'" 









###### 7 




This is what the Lord God says: It will not happen; it will not occur. 









###### 8 




The chief city of Aram is Damascus, the chief of Damascus is Rezin (within sixty-five years Ephraim will be too shattered to be a people), 









###### 9 




the chief city of Ephraim is Samaria, and the chief of Samaria is the son of Remaliah. If you do not stand firm in your faith, then you will not stand at all. ## The Immanuel Prophecy 









###### 10 




Then the Lord spoke again to Ahaz: 









###### 11 




"Ask for a sign from the Lord your God--it can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven." 









###### 12 




But Ahaz replied, "I will not ask. I will not test the Lord." 









###### 13 




Isaiah said, "Listen, house of David! Is it not enough for you to try the patience of men? Will you also try the patience of my God? 









###### 14 




Therefore, the Lord himself will give you[^c] a sign: See, the virgin will conceive,[^d] have a son, and name him Immanuel.[^e] 









###### 15 




By the time he learns to reject what is bad and choose what is good, he will be eating curds[^f] and honey. 









###### 16 




For before the boy knows to reject what is bad and choose what is good, the land of the two kings you dread will be abandoned. 









###### 17 




The Lord will bring on you, your people, and your father's house such a time as has never been since Ephraim separated from Judah: He will bring the king of Assyria." 









###### 18 




On that day the Lord will whistle to flies at the farthest streams of the Nile and to bees in the land of Assyria. 









###### 19 




All of them will come and settle in the steep ravines, in the clefts of the rocks, in all the thornbushes, and in all the water holes. 









###### 20 




On that day the Lord will use a razor hired from beyond the Euphrates River--the king of Assyria--to shave the hair on your heads, the hair on your legs, and even your beards. 









###### 21 




On that day a man will raise a young cow and two sheep, 









###### 22 




and from the abundant milk they give he will eat curds, for every survivor in the land will eat curds and honey. 









###### 23 




And on that day every place where there were a thousand vines, worth a thousand pieces of silver, will become thorns and briers. 









###### 24 




A man will go there with bow and arrows because the whole land will be thorns and briers. 









###### 25 




You will not go to all the hills that were once tilled with a hoe, for fear of the thorns and briers. Those hills will be places for oxen to graze and for sheep to trample. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

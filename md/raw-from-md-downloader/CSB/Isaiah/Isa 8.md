# Isaiah 8

***










###### 1 




Then the Lord said to me, "Take a large piece of parchment[^a] and write on it with an ordinary pen:[^b] Maher-shalal-hash-baz.[^c] 









###### 2 




I have appointed[^d] trustworthy witnesses--the priest Uriah and Zechariah son of Jeberechiah." 









###### 3 




I was then intimate with the prophetess, and she conceived and gave birth to a son. The Lord said to me, "Name him Maher-shalal-hash-baz, 









###### 4 




for before the boy knows how to call 'Father,' or 'Mother,' the wealth of Damascus and the spoils of Samaria will be carried off to the king of Assyria." 









###### 5 




The Lord spoke to me again: 









###### 6 




Because these people rejected the slowly flowing water of Shiloah and rejoiced with[^e] Rezin and the son of Remaliah, 









###### 7 




the Lord will certainly bring against them the mighty rushing water of the Euphrates River-- the king of Assyria and all his glory. It will overflow its channels and spill over all its banks. 









###### 8 




It will pour into Judah, flood over it, and sweep through, reaching up to the neck; and its flooded banks[^f] will fill your entire land, Immanuel! 









###### 9 




Band together,[^g] peoples, and be broken; pay attention, all you distant lands; prepare for war, and be broken; prepare for war, and be broken. 









###### 10 




Devise a plan; it will fail. Make a prediction; it will not happen. For God is with us.[^h] ## The Lord of Armies, the Only Refuge 









###### 11 




For this is what the Lord said to me with great power, to keep[^i] me from going the way of this people: 









###### 12 




Do not call everything a conspiracy that these people say is a conspiracy. Do not fear what they fear; do not be terrified. 









###### 13 




You are to regard only the Lord of Armies as holy. Only he should be feared; only he should be held in awe. 









###### 14 




He will be a sanctuary; but for the two houses of Israel, he will be a stone to stumble over and a rock to trip over, and a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 









###### 15 




Many will stumble over these; they will fall and be broken; they will be snared and captured. 









###### 16 




Bind up the testimony. Seal up the instruction among my disciples. 









###### 17 




I will wait for the Lord, who is hiding his face from the house of Jacob. I will wait for him. 









###### 18 




Here I am with the children the Lord has given me to be signs and wonders in Israel from the Lord of Armies who dwells on Mount Zion. 









###### 19 




When they say to you, "Inquire of the mediums and the spiritists who chirp and mutter," shouldn't a people inquire of their God?[^j] Should they inquire of the dead on behalf of the living? 









###### 20 




Go to God's instruction and testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, there will be no dawn for them. 









###### 21 




They will wander through the land, dejected and hungry. When they are famished, they will become enraged, and, looking upward, will curse their king and their God. 









###### 22 




They will look toward the earth and see only distress, darkness, and the gloom of affliction, and they will be driven into thick darkness. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

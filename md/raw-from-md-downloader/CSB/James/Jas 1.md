# James 1

***










###### 1 




James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ: To the twelve tribes dispersed abroad.[^a] Greetings. ## Trials and Maturity 









###### 2 




Consider it a great joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you experience various trials, 









###### 3 




because you know that the testing of your faith produces endurance. 









###### 4 




And let endurance have its full effect, so that you may be mature and complete, lacking nothing. 









###### 5 




Now if any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God--who gives to all generously and ungrudgingly--and it will be given to him. 









###### 6 




But let him ask in faith without doubting.[^b] For the doubter is like the surging sea, driven and tossed by the wind. 









###### 7 




That person should not expect to receive anything from the Lord, 









###### 8 




being double-minded and unstable in all his ways.[^c] 









###### 9 




Let the brother of humble circumstances boast in his exaltation, 









###### 10 




but let the rich boast in his humiliation because he will pass away like a flower of the field. 









###### 11 




For the sun rises and, together with the scorching wind, dries up the grass; its flower falls off, and its beautiful appearance perishes. In the same way, the rich person will wither away while pursuing his activities. 









###### 12 




Blessed is the one who endures trials, because when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life that God[^d] has promised to those who love him. 









###### 13 




No one undergoing a trial should say, "I am being tempted by God," since God is not tempted by evil, and he himself doesn't tempt anyone. 









###### 14 




But each person is tempted when he is drawn away and enticed by his own evil desire. 









###### 15 




Then after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin, and when sin is fully grown, it gives birth to death. 









###### 16 




Don't be deceived, my dear brothers and sisters. 









###### 17 




Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, who does not change like shifting shadows. 









###### 18 




By his own choice, he gave us birth by the word of truth so that we would be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. ## Hearing and Doing the Word 









###### 19 




My dear brothers and sisters, understand this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to anger, 









###### 20 




for human anger does not accomplish God's righteousness. 









###### 21 




Therefore, ridding yourselves of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent,[^e] humbly receive the implanted word, which is able to save your souls. 









###### 22 




But be doers of the word and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. 









###### 23 




Because if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like someone looking at his own face[^f] in a mirror. 









###### 24 




For he looks at himself, goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of person he was. 









###### 25 




But the one who looks intently into the perfect law of freedom and perseveres in it, and is not a forgetful hearer but a doer who works--this person will be blessed in what he does. 









###### 26 




If anyone[^g] thinks he is religious without controlling his tongue, his religion is useless and he deceives himself. 









###### 27 




Pure and undefiled religion before God the Father is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself unstained from the world. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

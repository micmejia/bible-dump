# James 2

***










###### 1 




My brothers and sisters, do not show favoritism as you hold on to the faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ. 









###### 2 




For if someone comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and dressed in fine clothes, and a poor person dressed in filthy clothes also comes in, 









###### 3 




if you look with favor on the one wearing the fine clothes and say, "Sit here in a good place," and yet you say to the poor person, "Stand over there," or "Sit here on the floor by my footstool," 









###### 4 




haven't you made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts? 









###### 5 




Listen, my dear brothers and sisters: Didn't God choose the poor in this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom that he has promised to those who love him? 









###### 6 




Yet you have dishonored the poor. Don't the rich oppress you and drag you into court? 









###### 7 




Don't they blaspheme the good name that was invoked over you? 









###### 8 




Indeed, if you fulfill the royal law prescribed in the Scripture, <b class="quote">Love your neighbor as yourself**,[^a] you are doing well. 









###### 9 




If, however, you show favoritism, you commit sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors. 









###### 10 




For whoever keeps the entire law, and yet stumbles at one point, is guilty of breaking it all. 









###### 11 




For he who said, <b class="quote">Do not commit adultery**,[^b] also said, <b class="quote">Do not murder.**[^c] So if you do not commit adultery, but you murder, you are a lawbreaker. 









###### 12 




Speak and act as those who are to be judged by the law of freedom. 









###### 13 




For judgment is without mercy to the one who has not shown mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment. ## Faith and Works 









###### 14 




What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but does not have works? Can such faith save him? 









###### 15 




If a brother or sister is without clothes and lacks daily food 









###### 16 




and one of you says to them, "Go in peace, stay warm, and be well fed," but you don't give them what the body needs, what good is it? 









###### 17 




In the same way faith, if it does not have works, is dead by itself. 









###### 18 




But someone will say, "You have faith, and I have works."[^d] Show me your faith without works, and I will show you faith by my works. 









###### 19 




You believe that God is one. Good! Even the demons believe--and they shudder. 









###### 20 




Senseless person! Are you willing to learn that faith without works is useless? 









###### 21 




Wasn't Abraham our father justified by works in offering Isaac his son on the altar? 









###### 22 




You see that faith was active together with his works, and by works, faith was made complete, 









###### 23 




and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, <b class="quote">Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness**,[^e] and he was called God's friend. 









###### 24 




You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone. 









###### 25 




In the same way, wasn't Rahab the prostitute also justified by works in receiving the messengers and sending them out by a different route? 









###### 26 




For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

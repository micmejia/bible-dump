# James 3

***










###### 1 




Not many should become teachers, my brothers,[^a] because you know that we will receive a stricter judgment. 









###### 2 




For we all stumble in many ways. If anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is mature, able also to control the whole body. 









###### 3 




Now if we put bits into the mouths of horses so that they obey us, we direct their whole bodies. 









###### 4 




And consider ships: Though very large and driven by fierce winds, they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs. 









###### 5 




So too, though the tongue is a small part of the body, it boasts great things. Consider how a small fire sets ablaze a large forest. 









###### 6 




And the tongue is a fire. The tongue, a world of unrighteousness, is placed[^b] among our members. It stains the whole body, sets the course of life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell. 









###### 7 




Every kind of animal, bird, reptile, and fish is tamed and has been tamed by humankind, 









###### 8 




but no one can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison. 









###### 9 




With the tongue we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people who are made in God's likeness. 









###### 10 




Blessing and cursing come out of the same mouth. My brothers and sisters, these things should not be this way. 









###### 11 




Does a spring pour out sweet and bitter water from the same opening? 









###### 12 




Can a fig tree produce olives, my brothers and sisters, or a grapevine produce figs? Neither can a saltwater spring yield fresh water. ## The Wisdom from Above 









###### 13 




Who among you is wise and understanding? By his good conduct he should show that his works are done in the gentleness that comes from wisdom. 









###### 14 




But if you have bitter envy and selfish ambition in your heart, don't boast and deny the truth. 









###### 15 




Such wisdom does not come down from above but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic. 









###### 16 




For where there is envy and selfish ambition, there is disorder and every evil practice. 









###### 17 




But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peace-loving, gentle, compliant, full of mercy and good fruits, unwavering, without pretense. 









###### 18 




And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who cultivate peace. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

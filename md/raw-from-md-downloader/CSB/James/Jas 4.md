# James 4

***










###### 1 




What is the source of wars and fights among you? Don't they come from your passions that wage war within you?[^a] 









###### 2 




You desire and do not have. You murder and covet and cannot obtain. You fight and wage war.[^b] You do not have because you do not ask. 









###### 3 




You ask and don't receive because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it on your pleasures. 









###### 4 




You adulterous people![^c] Don't you know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? So whoever wants to be the friend of the world becomes the enemy of God. 









###### 5 




Or do you think it's without reason that the Scripture says: The spirit he made to dwell in us envies intensely?[^d] 









###### 6 




But he gives greater grace. Therefore he says: <b class="quote">God resists the proud** <b class="quote">but gives grace to the humble.**[^e] 









###### 7 




Therefore, submit to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. 









###### 8 




Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded. 









###### 9 




Be miserable and mourn and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom. 









###### 10 




Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you. 









###### 11 




Don't criticize one another, brothers and sisters. Anyone who defames or judges a fellow believer[^f] defames and judges the law. If you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge. 









###### 12 




There is one lawgiver and judge[^g] who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge your neighbor? ## Our Will and God's Will 









###### 13 




Come now, you who say, "Today or tomorrow we will travel to such and such a city and spend a year there and do business and make a profit." 









###### 14 




Yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring--what your life will be! For you are like vapor that appears for a little while, then vanishes. 









###### 15 




Instead, you should say, "If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that." 









###### 16 




But as it is, you boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil. 









###### 17 




So it is sin to know the good and yet not do it. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

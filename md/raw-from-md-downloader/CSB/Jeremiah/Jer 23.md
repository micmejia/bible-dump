# Jeremiah 23

***










###### 1 




"Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture!" This is the Lord's declaration. 









###### 2 




"Therefore, this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says about the shepherds who tend my people: You have scattered my flock, banished them, and have not attended to them. I am about to attend to you because of your evil acts"--this is the Lord's declaration. 









###### 3 




"I will gather the remnant of my flock from all the lands where I have banished them, and I will return them to their grazing land. They will become fruitful and numerous. 









###### 4 




I will raise up shepherds over them who will tend them. They will no longer be afraid or discouraged, nor will any be missing." This is the Lord's declaration. ## The Righteous Branch of David 









###### 5 




"Look, the days are coming"--this is the Lord's declaration-- "when I will raise up a Righteous Branch for David. He will reign wisely as king and administer justice and righteousness in the land. 









###### 6 




In his days Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell securely. This is the name he will be called: The Lord Is Our Righteousness.[^a] 









###### 7 




"Look, the days are coming"--the Lord's declaration--"when it will no longer be said, 'As the Lord lives who brought the Israelites from the land of Egypt,' 









###### 8 




but, 'As the Lord lives, who brought and led the descendants of the house of Israel from the land of the north and from all the other countries where I[^b] had banished them.' They will dwell once more in their own land." ## False Prophets Condemned 









###### 9 




Concerning the prophets: My heart is broken within me, and all my bones tremble. I have become like a drunkard, like a man overcome by wine, because of the Lord, because of his holy words. 









###### 10 




For the land is full of adulterers; the land mourns because of the curse, and the grazing lands in the wilderness have dried up. Their way of life[^c] has become evil, and their power is not rightly used 









###### 11 




because both prophet and priest are ungodly, even in my house I have found their evil. This is the Lord's declaration. 









###### 12 




Therefore, their way will seem like slippery paths in the gloom. They will be driven away and fall down there, for I will bring disaster on them, the year of their punishment. This is the Lord's declaration. 









###### 13 




Among the prophets of Samaria I saw something disgusting: They prophesied by Baal and led my people Israel astray. 









###### 14 




Among the prophets of Jerusalem also I saw a horrible thing: They commit adultery and walk in lies. They strengthen the hands of evildoers, and none turns his back on evil. They are all like Sodom to me; Jerusalem's residents are like Gomorrah. 









###### 15 




Therefore, this is what the Lord of Armies says concerning the prophets: I am about to feed them wormwood and give them poisoned water to drink, for from the prophets of Jerusalem ungodliness[^d] has spread throughout the land. 









###### 16 




This is what the Lord of Armies says: "Do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you. They are deluding you. They speak visions from their own minds, not from the Lord's mouth. 









###### 17 




They keep on saying to those who despise me, 'The Lord has spoken: You will have peace.' They have said to everyone who follows the stubbornness of his heart, 'No harm will come to you.'" 









###### 18 




For who has stood in the council of the Lord to see and hear his word? Who has paid attention to his word and obeyed? 









###### 19 




Look, a storm from the Lord! Wrath has gone out, a whirling storm. It will whirl about the heads of the wicked. 









###### 20 




The Lord's anger will not turn away until he has completely fulfilled the purposes of his heart. In time to come you will understand it clearly. 









###### 21 




I did not send out these prophets, yet they ran. I did not speak to them, yet they prophesied. 









###### 22 




If they had really stood in my council, they would have enabled my people to hear my words and would have turned them from their evil ways and their evil deeds. 









###### 23 




"Am I a God who is only near"--this is the Lord's declaration--"and not a God who is far away? 









###### 24 




Can a person hide in secret places where I cannot see him?" --the Lord's declaration. "Do I not fill the heavens and the earth?" --the Lord's declaration. 









###### 25 




"I have heard what the prophets who prophesy a lie in my name have said: 'I had a dream! I had a dream!' 









###### 26 




How long will this continue in the minds of the prophets prophesying lies, prophets of the deceit of their own minds? 









###### 27 




Through their dreams that they tell one another, they plan to cause my people to forget my name as their ancestors forgot my name through Baal worship. 









###### 28 




The prophet who has only a dream should recount the dream, but the one who has my word should speak my word truthfully, for what is straw compared to grain?"--this is the Lord's declaration. 









###### 29 




"Is not my word like fire"--this is the Lord's declaration--"and like a hammer that pulverizes rock? 









###### 30 




Therefore, take note! I am against the prophets"--the Lord's declaration--"who steal my words from each other. 









###### 31 




I am against the prophets"--the Lord's declaration--"who use their own tongues to make a declaration. 









###### 32 




I am against those who prophesy false dreams"--the Lord's declaration--"telling them and leading my people astray with their reckless lies. It was not I who sent or commanded them, and they are of no benefit at all to these people"--this is the Lord's declaration. ## The Burden of the Lord 









###### 33 




"Now when these people or a prophet or a priest asks you, 'What is the burden[^e] of the Lord?' you will respond to them, 'What is the burden? I will throw you away! This is the Lord's declaration.' 









###### 34 




As for the prophet, priest, or people who say, 'The burden of the Lord,' I will punish that man and his household. 









###### 35 




This is what each man is to say to his friend and to his brother: 'What has the Lord answered?' or 'What has the Lord spoken?' 









###### 36 




But no longer refer to[^f] the burden of the Lord, for each man's word becomes his burden and you pervert the words of the living God, the Lord of Armies, our God. 









###### 37 




Say to the prophet, 'What has the Lord answered you?' or 'What has the Lord spoken?' 









###### 38 




But if you say, 'The burden of the Lord,' then this is what the Lord says: Because you have said, 'The burden of the Lord,' and I specifically told you not to say, 'The burden of the Lord,' 









###### 39 




I will surely forget you.[^g] I will throw you away from my presence--both you and the city that I gave you and your ancestors. 









###### 40 




I will bring on you everlasting disgrace and humiliation that will never be forgotten." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

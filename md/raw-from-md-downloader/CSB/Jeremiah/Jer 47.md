# Jeremiah 47

***










###### 1 




This is the word of the Lord that came to the prophet Jeremiah about the Philistines before Pharaoh defeated Gaza. 









###### 2 




This is what the Lord says: Look, water is rising from the north and becoming an overflowing wadi. It will overflow the land and everything in it, the cities and their inhabitants. The people will cry out, and every inhabitant of the land will wail. 









###### 3 




At the sound of the stomping hooves of his stallions, the rumbling of his chariots, and the clatter of their wheels, fathers will not turn back for their sons. They will be utterly helpless[^a] 









###### 4 




on account of the day that is coming to destroy all the Philistines, to cut off from Tyre and Sidon every remaining ally. Indeed, the Lord is about to destroy the Philistines, the remnant of the coastland of Caphtor.[^b] 









###### 5 




Baldness is coming to Gaza; Ashkelon will become silent. Remnant of their valley, how long will you gash yourself? 









###### 6 




Oh, sword of the Lord! How long will you be restless? Go back to your sheath; be still; be silent! 









###### 7 




How can it[^c] rest when the Lord has given it a command? He has assigned it against Ashkelon and the shore of the sea. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

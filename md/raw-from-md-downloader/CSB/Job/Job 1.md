# Job 1

***










###### 1 




There was a man in the country of Uz named Job. He was a man of complete integrity, who feared God and turned away from evil. 









###### 2 




He had seven sons and three daughters. 









###### 3 




His estate included seven thousand sheep and goats, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a very large number of servants. Job was the greatest man among all the people of the east. 









###### 4 




His sons used to take turns having banquets at their homes. They would send an invitation to their three sisters to eat and drink with them. 









###### 5 




Whenever a round of banqueting was over, Job would send for his children and purify them, rising early in the morning to offer burnt offerings for[^a] all of them. For Job thought, "Perhaps my children have sinned, having cursed God in their hearts." This was Job's regular practice. ## Satan's First Test of Job 









###### 6 




One day the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan[^b] also came with them. 









###### 7 




The Lord asked Satan, "Where have you come from?" "From roaming through the earth," Satan answered him, "and walking around on it." 









###### 8 




Then the Lord said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? No one else on earth is like him, a man of perfect integrity, who fears God and turns away from evil." 









###### 9 




Satan answered the Lord, "Does Job fear God for nothing? 









###### 10 




Haven't you placed a hedge around him, his household, and everything he owns? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land. 









###### 11 




But stretch out your hand and strike everything he owns, and he will surely curse you to your face." 









###### 12 




"Very well," the Lord told Satan, "everything he owns is in your power. However, do not lay a hand on Job himself." So Satan left the Lord's presence. 









###### 13 




One day when Job's sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house, 









###### 14 




a messenger came to Job and reported, "While the oxen were plowing and the donkeys grazing nearby, 









###### 15 




the Sabeans swooped down and took them away. They struck down the servants with the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you!" 









###### 16 




He was still speaking when another messenger came and reported, "God's fire fell from heaven. It burned the sheep and the servants and devoured them, and I alone have escaped to tell you!" 









###### 17 




That messenger was still speaking when yet another came and reported, "The Chaldeans formed three bands, made a raid on the camels, and took them away. They struck down the servants with the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you!" 









###### 18 




He was still speaking when another messenger came and reported, "Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house. 









###### 19 




Suddenly a powerful wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on the young people so that they died, and I alone have escaped to tell you!" 









###### 20 




Then Job stood up, tore his robe, and shaved his head. He fell to the ground and worshiped, 









###### 21 




saying: Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked I will leave this life.[^c] The Lord gives, and the Lord takes away. Blessed be the name of the Lord. 









###### 22 




Throughout all this Job did not sin or blame God for anything.[^d] ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

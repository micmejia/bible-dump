# Job 10

***










###### 1 




I am disgusted with my life. I will give vent to my complaint and speak in the bitterness of my soul. 









###### 2 




I will say to God, "Do not declare me guilty! Let me know why you prosecute me. 









###### 3 




Is it good for you to oppress, to reject the work of your hands, and favor[^a] the plans of the wicked? 









###### 4 




Do you have eyes of flesh, or do you see as a human sees? 









###### 5 




Are your days like those of a human, or your years like those of a man, 









###### 6 




that you look for my iniquity and search for my sin, 









###### 7 




even though you know that I am not wicked and that there is no one who can rescue from your power? 









###### 8 




"Your hands shaped me and formed me. Will you now turn and destroy me? 









###### 9 




Please remember that you formed me like clay. Will you now return me to dust? 









###### 10 




Did you not pour me out like milk and curdle me like cheese? 









###### 11 




You clothed me with skin and flesh, and wove me together with bones and tendons. 









###### 12 




You gave me life and faithful love, and your care has guarded my life. 









###### 13 




"Yet you concealed these thoughts in your heart; I know that this was your hidden plan:[^b] 









###### 14 




if I sin, you would notice,[^c] and would not acquit me of my iniquity. 









###### 15 




If I am wicked, woe to me! And even if I am righteous, I cannot lift up my head. I am filled with shame and have drunk deeply of[^d] my affliction. 









###### 16 




If I am proud,[^e] you hunt me like a lion and again display your miraculous power against me. 









###### 17 




You produce new witnesses[^f] against me and multiply your anger toward me. Hardships assault me, wave after wave.[^g] 









###### 18 




"Why did you bring me out of the womb? I should have died and never been seen. 









###### 19 




I wish[^h] I had never existed but had been carried from the womb to the grave. 









###### 20 




Are my days not few? Stop it![^i] Leave me alone, so that I can smile a little 









###### 21 




before I go to a land of darkness and gloom, never to return. 









###### 22 




It is a land of blackness like the deepest darkness, gloomy and chaotic, where even the light is like[^j] the darkness." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

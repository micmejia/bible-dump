# Job 12

***










###### 1 




Then Job answered: 









###### 2 




No doubt you are the people, and wisdom will die with you! 









###### 3 




But I also have a mind like you; I am not inferior to you. Who doesn't know the things you are talking about?[^a] 









###### 4 




I am a laughingstock to my[^b] friends, by calling on God, who answers me.[^c] The righteous and blameless man is a laughingstock. 









###### 5 




The one who is at ease holds calamity in contempt and thinks it is prepared for those whose feet are slipping. 









###### 6 




The tents of robbers are safe, and those who trouble God are secure; God holds them in his hands.[^d] 









###### 7 




But ask the animals, and they will instruct you; ask the birds of the sky, and they will tell you. 









###### 8 




Or speak to the earth, and it will instruct you; let the fish of the sea inform you. 









###### 9 




Which of all these does not know that the hand of the Lord has done this? 









###### 10 




The life of every living thing is in his hand, as well as the breath of all humanity. 









###### 11 




Doesn't the ear test words as the palate tastes food? 









###### 12 




Wisdom is found with the elderly, and understanding comes with long life. 









###### 13 




Wisdom and strength belong to God; counsel and understanding are his. 









###### 14 




Whatever he tears down cannot be rebuilt; whoever he imprisons cannot be released. 









###### 15 




When he withholds water, everything dries up, and when he releases it, it destroys the land. 









###### 16 




True wisdom and power belong to him. The deceived and the deceiver are his. 









###### 17 




He leads counselors away barefoot and makes judges go mad. 









###### 18 




He releases the bonds[^e] put on by kings and fastens a belt around their waists. 









###### 19 




He leads priests away barefoot and overthrows established leaders. 









###### 20 




He deprives trusted advisers of speech and takes away the elders' good judgment. 









###### 21 




He pours out contempt on nobles and disarms[^f] the strong. 









###### 22 




He reveals mysteries from the darkness and brings the deepest darkness into the light. 









###### 23 




He makes nations great, then destroys them; he enlarges nations, then leads them away. 









###### 24 




He deprives the world's leaders of reason, and makes them wander in a trackless wasteland. 









###### 25 




They grope around in darkness without light; he makes them stagger like a drunkard. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

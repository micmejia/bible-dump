# Job 13

***










###### 1 




Look, my eyes have seen all this; my ears have heard and understood it. 









###### 2 




Everything you know, I also know; I am not inferior to you. 









###### 3 




Yet I prefer to speak to the Almighty and argue my case before God. 









###### 4 




You use lies like plaster; you are all worthless healers. 









###### 5 




If only you would shut up and let that be your wisdom! 









###### 6 




Hear now my argument, and listen to my defense.[^a] 









###### 7 




Would you testify unjustly on God's behalf or speak deceitfully for him? 









###### 8 




Would you show partiality to him or argue the case in his defense? 









###### 9 




Would it go well if he examined you? Could you deceive him as you would deceive a man? 









###### 10 




Surely he would rebuke you if you secretly showed partiality. 









###### 11 




Would God's majesty not terrify you? Would his dread not fall on you? 









###### 12 




Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ash; your defenses are made of clay. 









###### 13 




Be quiet,[^b] and I will speak. Let whatever comes happen to me. 









###### 14 




I will put[^c] myself at risk[^d] and take my life in my own hands. 









###### 15 




Even if he kills me, I will hope in him.[^e] I will still defend my ways before him. 









###### 16 




Yes, this will result in my deliverance, for no godless person can appear before him. 









###### 17 




Pay close attention to my words; let my declaration ring in your ears. 









###### 18 




Now then, I have prepared my case; I know that I am right. 









###### 19 




Can anyone indict me? If so, I will be silent and die. 









###### 20 




Only grant these two things to me, God, so that I will not have to hide from your presence: 









###### 21 




remove your hand from me, and do not let your terror frighten me. 









###### 22 




Then call, and I will answer, or I will speak, and you can respond to me. 









###### 23 




How many iniquities and sins have I committed?[^f] Reveal to me my transgression and sin. 









###### 24 




Why do you hide your face and consider me your enemy? 









###### 25 




Will you frighten a wind-driven leaf? Will you chase after dry straw? 









###### 26 




For you record bitter accusations against me and make me inherit the iniquities of my youth. 









###### 27 




You put my feet in the stocks and stand watch over all my paths, setting a limit for the soles[^g] of my feet. 









###### 28

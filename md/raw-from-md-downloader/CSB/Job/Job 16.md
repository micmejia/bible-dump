# Job 16

***










###### 1 




Then Job answered: 









###### 2 




I have heard many things like these. You are all miserable comforters. 









###### 3 




Is there no end to your empty[^a] words? What provokes you that you continue testifying? 









###### 4 




If you were in my place I could also talk like you. I could string words together against you and shake my head at you. 









###### 5 




Instead, I would encourage you with my mouth, and the consolation from my lips would bring relief. 









###### 6 




If I speak, my suffering is not relieved, and if I hold back, does any of it leave me? 









###### 7 




Surely he[^b] has now exhausted me. You have devastated my entire family. 









###### 8 




You have shriveled me up[^c]--it has become a witness; my frailty rises up against me and testifies to my face. 









###### 9 




His anger tears at me, and he harasses me. He gnashes his teeth at me. My enemy pierces me with his eyes. 









###### 10 




They open their mouths against me and strike my cheeks with contempt; they join themselves together against me. 









###### 11 




God hands me over to the unjust;[^d] he throws me to the wicked. 









###### 12 




I was at ease, but he shattered me; he seized me by the scruff of the neck and smashed me to pieces. He set me up as his target; 









###### 13 




his archers[^e] surround me. He pierces my kidneys without mercy and pours my bile on the ground. 









###### 14 




He breaks through my defenses again and again;[^f] he charges at me like a warrior. 









###### 15 




I have sewn sackcloth over my skin; I have buried my strength[^g] in the dust. 









###### 16 




My face has grown red with weeping, and darkness covers my eyes, 









###### 17 




although my hands are free from violence and my prayer is pure. 









###### 18 




Earth, do not cover my blood; may my cry for help find no resting place. 









###### 19 




Even now my witness is in heaven, and my advocate is in the heights! 









###### 20 




My friends scoff at me as I weep before God. 









###### 21 




I wish that someone might argue for a man with God just as anyone[^h] would for a friend. 









###### 22 




For only a few years will pass before I go the way of no return. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

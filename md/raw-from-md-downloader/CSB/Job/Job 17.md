# Job 17

***










###### 1 




My spirit is broken. My days are extinguished. A graveyard awaits me. 









###### 2 




Surely mockers surround[^a] me, and my eyes must gaze at their rebellion. 









###### 3 




Accept my pledge! Put up security for me. Who else will be my sponsor?[^b] 









###### 4 




You have closed their minds to understanding, therefore you will not honor them. 









###### 5 




If a man denounces his friends for a price, the eyes of his children will fail. 









###### 6 




He has made me an object of scorn to the people; I have become a man people spit at.[^c] 









###### 7 




My eyes have grown dim from grief, and my whole body has become but a shadow. 









###### 8 




The upright are appalled at this, and the innocent are roused against the godless. 









###### 9 




Yet the righteous person will hold to his way, and the one whose hands are clean will grow stronger. 









###### 10 




But come back and try again, all of you.[^d] I will not find a wise man among you. 









###### 11 




My days have slipped by; my plans have been ruined, even the things dear to my heart. 









###### 12 




They turned night into day and made light seem near in the face of darkness. 









###### 13 




If I await Sheol as my home, spread out my bed in darkness, 









###### 14 




and say to corruption, "You are my father," and to the maggot, "My mother" or "My sister," 









###### 15 




where then is my hope? Who can see any hope for me? 









###### 16 




Will it go down to the gates of Sheol, or will we descend together to the dust? ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

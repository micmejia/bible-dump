# Job 19

***










###### 1 




Then Job answered: 









###### 2 




How long will you torment me and crush me with words? 









###### 3 




You have humiliated me ten times now, and you mistreat[^a] me without shame. 









###### 4 




Even if it is true that I have sinned, my mistake concerns only[^b] me. 









###### 5 




If you really want to appear superior to me and would use my disgrace as evidence against me, 









###### 6 




then understand that it is God who has wronged me and caught me in his net. 









###### 7 




I cry out, "Violence!" but get no response; I call for help, but there is no justice. 









###### 8 




He has blocked my way so that I cannot pass through; he has veiled my paths with darkness. 









###### 9 




He has stripped me of my honor and removed the crown from my head. 









###### 10 




He tears me down on every side so that I am ruined.[^c] He uproots my hope like a tree. 









###### 11 




His anger burns against me, and he regards me as one of his enemies. 









###### 12 




His troops advance together; they construct a ramp[^d] against me and camp around my tent. 









###### 13 




He has removed my brothers from me; my acquaintances have abandoned me. 









###### 14 




My relatives stop coming by, and my close friends have forgotten me. 









###### 15 




My house guests[^e] and female servants regard me as a stranger; I am a foreigner in their sight. 









###### 16 




I call for my servant, but he does not answer, even if I beg him with my own mouth. 









###### 17 




My breath is offensive to my wife, and my own family[^f] finds me repulsive. 









###### 18 




Even young boys scorn me. When I stand up, they mock me. 









###### 19 




All of my best friends[^g] despise me, and those I love have turned against me. 









###### 20 




My skin and my flesh cling to my bones; I have escaped with only the skin of my teeth. 









###### 21 




Have mercy on me, my friends, have mercy, for God's hand has struck me. 









###### 22 




Why do you persecute me as God does? Will you never get enough of my flesh? 









###### 23 




I wish that my words were written down, that they were recorded on a scroll 









###### 24 




or were inscribed in stone forever by an iron stylus and lead! 









###### 25 




But I know that my Redeemer lives,[^h] and at the end he will stand on the dust. 









###### 26 




Even after my skin has been destroyed,[^i] yet I will see God in[^j] my flesh. 









###### 27 




I will see him myself; my eyes will look at him, and not as a stranger.[^k] My heart longs[^l] within me. 









###### 28 




If you say, "How will we pursue him, since the root of the problem lies with him?" [^m] 









###### 29 




then be afraid of the sword, because wrath brings punishment by the sword, so that you may know there is a judgment. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

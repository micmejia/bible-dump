# Job 20

***










###### 1 




Then Zophar the Naamathite replied: 









###### 2 




This is why my unsettling thoughts compel me to answer, because I am upset![^a] 









###### 3 




I have heard a rebuke that insults me, and my understanding[^b] makes me reply. 









###### 4 




Don't you know that ever since antiquity, from the time a human was placed on earth, 









###### 5 




the joy of the wicked has been brief and the happiness of the godless has lasted only a moment? 









###### 6 




Though his arrogance reaches heaven, and his head touches the clouds, 









###### 7 




he will vanish forever like his own dung. Those who know[^c] him will ask, "Where is he?" 









###### 8 




He will fly away like a dream and never be found; he will be chased away like a vision in the night. 









###### 9 




The eye that saw him will see him no more, and his household will no longer see him. 









###### 10 




His children will beg from[^d] the poor, for his own hands must give back his wealth. 









###### 11 




His frame may be full of youthful vigor, but it will lie down with him in dust. 









###### 12 




Though evil tastes sweet in his mouth and he conceals it under his tongue, 









###### 13 




though he cherishes it and will not let it go but keeps it in his mouth, 









###### 14 




yet the food in his stomach turns into cobras' venom inside him. 









###### 15 




He swallows wealth but must vomit it up; God will force it from his stomach. 









###### 16 




He will suck the poison of cobras; a viper's fangs[^e] will kill him. 









###### 17 




He will not enjoy the streams, the rivers flowing with honey and curds. 









###### 18 




He must return the fruit of his labor without consuming it; he doesn't enjoy the profits from his trading. 









###### 19 




For he oppressed and abandoned the poor; he seized a house he did not build. 









###### 20 




Because his appetite is never satisfied,[^f] he does not let anything he desires escape. 









###### 21 




Nothing is left for him to consume; therefore, his prosperity will not last. 









###### 22 




At the height of his success[^g] distress will come to him; the full weight of misery[^h] will crush him. 









###### 23 




When he fills his stomach, God will send his burning anger against him, raining it down on him while he is eating.[^i] 









###### 24 




If he flees from an iron weapon, an arrow from a bronze bow will pierce him. 









###### 25 




He pulls it out of his back, the flashing tip out of his liver.[^j] Terrors come over him. 









###### 26 




Total darkness is reserved for his treasures. A fire unfanned by human hands will consume him; it will feed on what is left in his tent. 









###### 27 




The heavens will expose his iniquity, and the earth will rise up against him. 









###### 28 




The possessions in his house will be removed, flowing away on the day of God's anger. 









###### 29 




This is the wicked person's lot from God, the inheritance God ordained for him. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

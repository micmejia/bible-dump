# Job 21

***










###### 1 




Then Job answered: 









###### 2 




Pay close attention to my words; let this be the consolation you offer. 









###### 3 




Bear with me while I speak; then after I have spoken, you may continue mocking. 









###### 4 




As for me, is my complaint against a human being? Then why shouldn't I be impatient? 









###### 5 




Look at me and shudder; put your hand over your mouth. 









###### 6 




When I think about it, I am terrified and my body trembles in horror. 









###### 7 




Why do the wicked continue to live, growing old and becoming powerful? 









###### 8 




Their children are established while they are still alive,[^a] and their descendants, before their eyes. 









###### 9 




Their homes are secure and free of fear; no rod from God strikes them. 









###### 10 




Their bulls breed without fail; their cows calve and do not miscarry. 









###### 11 




They let their little ones run around like lambs; their children skip about, 









###### 12 




singing to the tambourine and lyre and rejoicing at the sound of the flute. 









###### 13 




They spend[^b] their days in prosperity and go down to Sheol in peace. 









###### 14 




Yet they say to God, "Leave us alone! We don't want to know your ways. 









###### 15 




Who is the Almighty, that we should serve him, and what will we gain by pleading with him?" 









###### 16 




But their prosperity is not of their own doing. The counsel of the wicked is far from me! 









###### 17 




How often is the lamp of the wicked put out? Does disaster[^c] come on them? Does he apportion destruction in his anger? 









###### 18 




Are they like straw before the wind, like chaff a storm sweeps away? 









###### 19 




God reserves a person's punishment for his children. Let God repay the person himself, so that he may know it. 









###### 20 




Let his own eyes see his demise; let him drink from the Almighty's wrath! 









###### 21 




For what does he care about his family once he is dead, when the number of his months has run out? 









###### 22 




Can anyone teach God knowledge, since he judges the exalted ones?[^d] 









###### 23 




One person dies in excellent health,[^e] completely secure[^f] and at ease. 









###### 24 




His body is[^g] well fed,[^h] and his bones are full of marrow.[^i] 









###### 25 




Yet another person dies with a bitter soul, having never tasted prosperity. 









###### 26 




But they both lie in the dust, and worms cover them. 









###### 27 




I know your thoughts very well, the schemes by which you would wrong me. 









###### 28 




For you say, "Where now is the nobleman's house?" and "Where are the tents the wicked lived in?" 









###### 29 




Have you never consulted those who travel the roads? Don't you accept their reports?[^j] 









###### 30 




Indeed, the evil person is spared from the day of disaster, rescued from the day of wrath. 









###### 31 




Who would denounce his behavior to his face? Who would repay him for what he has done? 









###### 32 




He is carried to the grave, and someone keeps watch over his tomb. 









###### 33 




The dirt on his grave is[^k] sweet to him. Everyone follows behind him, and those who go before him are without number. 









###### 34

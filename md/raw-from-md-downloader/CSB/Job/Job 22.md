# Job 22

***










###### 1 




Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied: 









###### 2 




Can a man be of any use to God? Can even a wise man be of use to him? 









###### 3 




Does it delight the Almighty if you are righteous? Does he profit if you perfect your behavior? 









###### 4 




Does he correct you and take you to court because of your piety? 









###### 5 




Isn't your wickedness abundant and aren't your iniquities endless? 









###### 6 




For you took collateral from your brothers without cause, stripping off their clothes and leaving them naked. 









###### 7 




You gave no water to the thirsty and withheld food from the famished, 









###### 8 




while the land belonged to a powerful man and an influential man lived on it. 









###### 9 




You sent widows away empty-handed, and the strength of the fatherless was[^a] crushed. 









###### 10 




Therefore snares surround you, and sudden dread terrifies you, 









###### 11 




or darkness, so you cannot see, and a flood of water covers you. 









###### 12 




Isn't God as high as the heavens? And look at the highest stars--how lofty they are! 









###### 13 




Yet you say, "What does God know? Can he judge through total darkness? 









###### 14 




Clouds veil him so that he cannot see, as he walks on the circle of the sky." 









###### 15 




Will you continue on the ancient path that wicked men have walked? 









###### 16 




They were snatched away before their time, and their foundations were washed away by a river. 









###### 17 




They were the ones who said to God, "Leave us alone!" and "What can the Almighty do to us?" [^b] 









###### 18 




But it was he who filled their houses with good things. The counsel of the wicked is far from me! 









###### 19 




The righteous see this and rejoice; the innocent mock them, saying, 









###### 20 




"Surely our opponents are destroyed, and fire has consumed what they left behind." 









###### 21 




Come to terms with God and be at peace; in this way[^c] good will come to you. 









###### 22 




Receive instruction from his mouth, and place his sayings in your heart. 









###### 23 




If you return to the Almighty, you will be renewed. If you banish injustice from your tent 









###### 24 




and consign your gold to the dust, the gold of Ophir to the stones in the wadis, 









###### 25 




the Almighty will be your gold and your finest silver. 









###### 26 




Then you will delight in the Almighty and lift up your face to God. 









###### 27 




You will pray to him, and he will hear you, and you will fulfill your vows. 









###### 28 




When you make a decision, it will be carried out,[^d] and light will shine on your ways. 









###### 29 




When others are humiliated and you say, "Lift them up," God will save the humble.[^e] 









###### 30 




He will even rescue the guilty one, who will be rescued by the purity of your hands. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

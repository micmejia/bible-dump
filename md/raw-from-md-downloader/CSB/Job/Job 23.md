# Job 23

***










###### 1 




Then Job answered: 









###### 2 




Today also my complaint is bitter.[^a] His[^b] hand is heavy despite my groaning. 









###### 3 




If only I knew how to find him, so that I could go to his throne. 









###### 4 




I would plead my case before him and fill my mouth with arguments. 









###### 5 




I would learn how[^c] he would answer me; and understand what he would say to me. 









###### 6 




Would he prosecute me forcefully? No, he would certainly pay attention to me. 









###### 7 




Then an upright man could reason with him, and I would escape from my Judge[^d] forever. 









###### 8 




If I go east, he is not there, and if I go west, I cannot perceive him. 









###### 9 




When he is at work to the north, I cannot see him; when he turns south, I cannot find him. 









###### 10 




Yet he knows the way I have taken;[^e] when he has tested me, I will emerge as pure gold. 









###### 11 




My feet have followed in his tracks; I have kept to his way and not turned aside. 









###### 12 




I have not departed from the commands from his lips; I have treasured[^f] the words from his mouth more than my daily food. 









###### 13 




But he is unchangeable; who can oppose him? He does what he desires. 









###### 14 




He will certainly accomplish what he has decreed for me, and he has many more things like these in mind.[^g] 









###### 15 




Therefore I am terrified in his presence; when I consider this, I am afraid of him. 









###### 16 




God has made my heart faint; the Almighty has terrified me. 









###### 17 




Yet I am not destroyed[^h] by the darkness, by the thick darkness that covers my face. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

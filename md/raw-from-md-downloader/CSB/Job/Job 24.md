# Job 24

***










###### 1 




Why does the Almighty not reserve times for judgment? Why do those who know him never see his days? 









###### 2 




The wicked displace boundary markers. They steal a flock and provide pasture for it. 









###### 3 




They drive away the donkeys owned by the fatherless and take the widow's ox as collateral. 









###### 4 




They push the needy off the road; the poor of the land are forced into hiding. 









###### 5 




Like wild donkeys in the wilderness, the poor go out to their task of foraging for food; the desert provides nourishment for their children. 









###### 6 




They gather their fodder in the field and glean the vineyards of the wicked. 









###### 7 




Without clothing, they spend the night naked, having no covering against the cold. 









###### 8 




Drenched by mountain rains, they huddle against[^a] the rocks, shelterless. 









###### 9 




The fatherless infant is snatched from the breast; the nursing child of the poor is seized as collateral.[^b] 









###### 10 




Without clothing, they wander about naked. They carry sheaves but go hungry. 









###### 11 




They crush olives in their presses;[^c] they tread the winepresses, but go thirsty. 









###### 12 




From the city, men[^d] groan; the mortally wounded cry for help, yet God pays no attention to this crime. 









###### 13 




The wicked are those who rebel against the light. They do not recognize its ways or stay on its paths. 









###### 14 




The murderer rises at dawn to kill the poor and needy, and by night he becomes a thief. 









###### 15 




The adulterer's eye watches for twilight, thinking, "No eye will see me," and he covers his face. 









###### 16 




In the dark they break[^e] into houses; by day they lock themselves in,[^f] never experiencing the light. 









###### 17 




For the morning is like darkness to them. Surely they are familiar with the terrors of darkness! 









###### 18 




They float[^g] on the surface of the water. Their section of the land is cursed, so that they never go to their vineyards. 









###### 19 




As dry ground and heat snatch away the melted snow, so Sheol steals those who have sinned. 









###### 20 




The womb forgets them; worms feed on them; they are remembered no more. So injustice is broken like a tree. 









###### 21 




They prey on[^h] the childless woman who is unable to conceive, and do not deal kindly with the widow. 









###### 22 




Yet God drags away[^i] the mighty by his power; when he rises up, they have no assurance of life. 









###### 23 




He gives them a sense of security, so they can rely on it, but his eyes watch over their ways. 









###### 24 




They are exalted for a moment, then gone; they are brought low and shrivel up like everything else.[^j] They wither like heads of grain. 









###### 25 




If this is not true, then who can prove me a liar and show that my speech is worthless? ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Job 26

***










###### 1 




Then Job answered: 









###### 2 




How you have helped the powerless and delivered the arm that is weak! 









###### 3 




How you have counseled the unwise and abundantly provided insight! 









###### 4 




With whom did you speak these words? Whose breath came out of your mouth? 









###### 5 




The departed spirits tremble beneath the waters and all that inhabit them. 









###### 6 




Sheol is naked before God, and Abaddon has no covering. 









###### 7 




He stretches the northern skies over empty space; he hangs the earth on nothing. 









###### 8 




He wraps up the water in his clouds, yet the clouds do not burst beneath its weight. 









###### 9 




He obscures the view of his throne, spreading his cloud over it. 









###### 10 




He laid out the horizon on the surface of the waters at the boundary between light and darkness. 









###### 11 




The pillars that hold up the sky tremble, astounded at his rebuke. 









###### 12 




By his power he stirred the sea, and by his understanding he crushed Rahab. 









###### 13 




By his breath the heavens gained their beauty; his hand pierced the fleeing serpent.[^a] 









###### 14 




These are but the fringes of his ways; how faint is the word we hear of him! Who can understand his mighty thunder? ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Job 3

***










###### 1 




After this, Job began to speak and cursed the day he was born. 









###### 2 




He said: 









###### 3 




May the day I was born perish, and the night that said, "A boy is conceived." 









###### 4 




If only that day had turned to darkness! May God above not care about it, or light shine on it. 









###### 5 




May darkness and gloom reclaim it, and a cloud settle over it. May what darkens the day terrify it. 









###### 6 




If only darkness had taken that night away! May it not appear[^a] among the days of the year or be listed in the calendar.[^b] 









###### 7 




Yes, may that night be barren; may no joyful shout be heard in it. 









###### 8 




Let those who curse days condemn it, those who are ready to rouse Leviathan. 









###### 9 




May its morning stars grow dark. May it wait for daylight but have none; may it not see the breaking[^c] of dawn. 









###### 10 




For that night did not shut the doors of my mother's womb, and hide sorrow from my eyes. 









###### 11 




Why was I not stillborn; why didn't I die as I came from the womb? 









###### 12 




Why did the knees receive me, and why were there breasts for me to nurse? 









###### 13 




Now I would certainly be lying down in peace; I would be asleep. Then I would be at rest 









###### 14 




with the kings and counselors of the earth, who rebuilt ruined cities for themselves, 









###### 15 




or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver. 









###### 16 




Or why was I not hidden like a miscarried child, like infants who never see daylight? 









###### 17 




There the wicked cease to make trouble, and there the weary find rest. 









###### 18 




The captives are completely at rest; they do not hear a taskmaster's voice. 









###### 19 




Both small and great are there, and the slave is set free from his master. 









###### 20 




Why is light given to one burdened with grief, and life to those whose existence is bitter, 









###### 21 




who wait for death, but it does not come, and search for it more than for hidden treasure, 









###### 22 




who are filled with much joy and are glad when they reach the grave? 









###### 23 




Why is life given to a man whose path is hidden, whom God has hedged in? 









###### 24 




I sigh when food is put before me,[^d] and my groans pour out like water. 









###### 25 




For the thing I feared has overtaken me, and what I dreaded has happened to me. 









###### 26 




I cannot relax or be calm; I have no rest, for turmoil has come. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Job 30

***










###### 1 




But now they mock me, men younger than I am, whose fathers I would have refused to put with my sheep dogs. 









###### 2 




What use to me was the strength of their hands? Their vigor had left them. 









###### 3 




Emaciated from poverty and hunger, they gnawed the dry land, the desolate wasteland by night. 









###### 4 




They plucked mallow[^a] among the shrubs, and the roots of the broom tree were their food. 









###### 5 




They were banished from human society; people shouted at them as if they were thieves. 









###### 6 




They are living on the slopes of the wadis, among the rocks and in holes in the ground. 









###### 7 




They bray among the shrubs; they huddle beneath the thistles. 









###### 8 




Foolish men, without even a name. They were forced to leave the land. 









###### 9 




Now I am mocked by their songs; I have become an object of scorn to them. 









###### 10 




They despise me and keep their distance from me; they do not hesitate to spit in my face. 









###### 11 




Because God has loosened my[^b] bowstring and oppressed me, they have cast off restraint in my presence. 









###### 12 




The rabble[^c] rise up at my right; they trap[^d] my feet and construct their siege ramp[^e] against me. 









###### 13 




They tear up my path; they contribute to my destruction, without anyone to help them. 









###### 14 




They advance as through a gaping breach; they keep rolling in through the ruins. 









###### 15 




Terrors are turned loose against me; they chase my dignity away like the wind, and my prosperity has passed by like a cloud. 









###### 16 




Now my life is poured out before me, and days of suffering have seized me. 









###### 17 




Night pierces my bones, but my gnawing pains never rest. 









###### 18 




My clothing is distorted with great force; he chokes me by the neck of my garment.[^f] 









###### 19 




He throws me into the mud, and I have become like dust and ashes. 









###### 20 




I cry out to you for help, but you do not answer me; when I stand up, you merely look at me. 









###### 21 




You have turned against me with cruelty; you harass me with your strong hand. 









###### 22 




You lift me up on the wind and make me ride it; you scatter me in the storm. 









###### 23 




Yes, I know that you will lead me to death-- the place appointed for all who live. 









###### 24 




Yet no one would stretch out his hand against a ruined person[^g] when he cries out to him for help because of his distress. 









###### 25 




Have I not wept for those who have fallen on hard times? Has my soul not grieved for the needy? 









###### 26 




But when I hoped for good, evil came; when I looked for light, darkness came. 









###### 27 




I am churning within[^h] and cannot rest; days of suffering confront me. 









###### 28 




I walk about blackened, but not by the sun.[^i] I stood in the assembly and cried out for help. 









###### 29 




I have become a brother to jackals and a companion of ostriches. 









###### 30 




My skin blackens and flakes off,[^j] and my bones burn with fever. 









###### 31 




My lyre is used for mourning and my flute for the sound of weeping. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

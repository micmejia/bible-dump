# Job 32

***










###### 1 




So these three men quit answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes. 









###### 2 




Then Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite from the family of Ram became angry. He was angry at Job because he had justified himself rather than God. 









###### 3 




He was also angry at Job's three friends because they had failed to refute him and yet had condemned him.[^a] 









###### 4 




Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because they were all older than he. 









###### 5 




But when he saw that the three men could not answer Job, he became angry. 









###### 6 




So Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite replied: I am young in years, while you are old; therefore I was timid and afraid to tell you what I know. 









###### 7 




I thought that age should speak and maturity should teach wisdom. 









###### 8 




But it is the spirit in a person-- the breath from the Almighty-- that gives anyone understanding. 









###### 9 




It is not only the old who are wise or the elderly who understand how to judge. 









###### 10 




Therefore I say, "Listen to me. I too will declare what I know." 









###### 11 




Look, I waited for your conclusions; I listened to your insights as you sought for words. 









###### 12 




I paid close attention to you. Yet no one proved Job wrong; not one of you refuted his arguments. 









###### 13 




So do not claim, "We have found wisdom; let God deal with him, not man." 









###### 14 




But Job has not directed his argument to me, and I will not respond to him with your arguments. 









###### 15 




Job's friends are dismayed and can no longer answer; words have left them. 









###### 16 




Should I continue to wait now that they are silent, now that they stand there and no longer answer? 









###### 17 




I too will answer;[^b] yes, I will tell what I know. 









###### 18 




For I am full of words, and my spirit[^c] compels me to speak. 









###### 19 




My heart[^d] is like unvented wine; it is about to burst like new wineskins. 









###### 20 




I must speak so that I can find relief; I must open my lips and respond. 









###### 21 




I will be partial to no one, and I will not give anyone an undeserved title. 









###### 22 




For I do not know how to give such titles; otherwise, my Maker would remove me in an instant. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

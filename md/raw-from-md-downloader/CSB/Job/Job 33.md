# Job 33

***










###### 1 




But now, Job, pay attention to my speech, and listen to all my words. 









###### 2 




I am going to open my mouth; my tongue will form words on my palate. 









###### 3 




My words come from my upright heart, and my lips speak with sincerity what they know. 









###### 4 




The Spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life. 









###### 5 




Refute me if you can. Prepare your case against me; take your stand. 









###### 6 




I am just like you before God; I was also pinched off from a piece of clay. 









###### 7 




Fear of me should not terrify you; no pressure from me should weigh you down. 









###### 8 




Surely you have spoken in my hearing, and I have heard these very[^a] words: 









###### 9 




"I am pure, without transgression; I am clean and have no iniquity. 









###### 10 




But he finds reasons to oppose me; he regards me as his enemy. 









###### 11 




He puts my feet in the stocks; he stands watch over all my paths." 









###### 12 




But I tell you that you are wrong in this matter, since God is greater than man. 









###### 13 




Why do you take him to court for not answering anything a person asks?[^b] 









###### 14 




For God speaks time and again, but a person may not notice it. 









###### 15 




In a dream, a vision in the night, when deep sleep comes over people as they slumber on their beds, 









###### 16 




he uncovers their ears and terrifies them[^c] with warnings, 









###### 17 




in order to turn a person from his actions and suppress the pride of a person. 









###### 18 




God spares his soul from the Pit, his life from crossing the river of death.[^d] 









###### 19 




A person may be disciplined on his bed with pain and constant distress in his bones, 









###### 20 




so that he detests bread, and his soul despises his favorite food. 









###### 21 




His flesh wastes away to nothing,[^e] and his unseen bones stick out. 









###### 22 




He draws near to the Pit, and his life to the executioners. 









###### 23 




If there is an angel on his side, one mediator out of a thousand, to tell a person what is right for him[^f] 









###### 24 




and to be gracious to him and say, "Spare him from going down to the Pit; I have found a ransom," 









###### 25 




then his flesh will be healthier[^g] than in his youth, and he will return to the days of his youthful vigor. 









###### 26 




He will pray to God, and God will delight in him. That person will see his face with a shout of joy, and God will restore his righteousness to him. 









###### 27 




He will look at men and say, "I have sinned and perverted what was right; yet I did not get what I deserved.[^h] 









###### 28 




He redeemed my soul from going down to the Pit, and I will continue to see the light." 









###### 29 




God certainly does all these things two or three times to a person 









###### 30 




in order to turn him back from the Pit, so he may shine with the light of life. 









###### 31 




Pay attention, Job, and listen to me. Be quiet, and I will speak. 









###### 32 




But if you have something to say,[^i] answer me; speak, for I would like to justify you. 









###### 33 




If not, then listen to me; be quiet, and I will teach you wisdom. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

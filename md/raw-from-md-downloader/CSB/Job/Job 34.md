# Job 34

***










###### 1 




Then Elihu continued,[^a] saying: 









###### 2 




Hear my words, you wise ones, and listen to me, you knowledgeable ones. 









###### 3 




Doesn't the ear test words as the palate tastes food? 









###### 4 




Let us judge for ourselves what is right; let us decide together what is good. 









###### 5 




For Job has declared, "I am righteous, yet God has deprived me of justice. 









###### 6 




Would I lie about my case? My wound[^b] is incurable, though I am without transgression." 









###### 7 




What man is like Job? He drinks derision like water. 









###### 8 




He keeps company with evildoers and walks with wicked men. 









###### 9 




For he has said, "A man gains nothing when he becomes God's friend." 









###### 10 




Therefore listen to me, you men of understanding. It is impossible for God to do wrong, and for the Almighty to act unjustly. 









###### 11 




For he repays a person according to his deeds, and he gives him what his conduct deserves.[^c] 









###### 12 




Indeed, it is true that God does not act wickedly and the Almighty does not pervert justice. 









###### 13 




Who gave him authority over the earth? Who put him in charge of the entire world? 









###### 14 




If he put his mind to it and withdrew the spirit and breath he gave, 









###### 15 




every living thing would perish together and mankind would return to the dust. 









###### 16 




If you have understanding, hear this; listen to what I have to say. 









###### 17 




Could one who hates justice govern the world? Will you condemn the mighty Righteous One, 









###### 18 




who says to a king, "Worthless man!" and to nobles, "Wicked men!"? 









###### 19 




God is not partial to princes and does not favor the rich over the poor, for they are all the work of his hands. 









###### 20 




They die suddenly in the middle of the night; people shudder, then pass away. Even the mighty are removed without effort. 









###### 21 




For his eyes watch over a man's ways, and he observes all his steps. 









###### 22 




There is no darkness, no deep darkness, where evildoers can hide. 









###### 23 




God does not need to examine a person further, that one should[^d] approach him in court. 









###### 24 




He shatters the mighty without an investigation and sets others in their place. 









###### 25 




Therefore, he recognizes their deeds and overthrows them by night, and they are crushed. 









###### 26 




In full view of the public,[^e] he strikes them for their wickedness, 









###### 27 




because they turned aside from following him and did not understand any of his ways 









###### 28 




but caused the poor to cry out to him, and he heard the outcry of the needy. 









###### 29 




But when God is silent, who can declare him guilty? When he hides his face, who can see him? Yet he watches over both individuals and nations, 









###### 30 




so that godless men should not rule or ensnare the people. 









###### 31 




Suppose someone says to God, "I have endured my punishment; I will no longer act wickedly. 









###### 32 




Teach me what I cannot see; if I have done wrong, I won't do it again." 









###### 33 




Should God repay you on your terms when you have rejected his? You must choose, not I! So declare what you know. 









###### 34 




Reasonable men will say to me, along with the wise men who hear me, 









###### 35 




"Job speaks without knowledge; his words are without insight." 









###### 36 




If only Job were tested to the limit, because his answers are like those of wicked men. 









###### 37 




For he adds rebellion to his sin; he scornfully claps in our presence, while multiplying his words against God. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

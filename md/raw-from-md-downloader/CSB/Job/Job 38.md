# Job 38

***










###### 1 




Then the Lord answered Job from the whirlwind. He said: 









###### 2 




Who is this who obscures my counsel with ignorant words? 









###### 3 




Get ready to answer me like a man; when I question you, you will inform me. 









###### 4 




Where were you when I established the earth? Tell me, if you have[^a] understanding. 









###### 5 




Who fixed its dimensions? Certainly you know! Who stretched a measuring line across it? 









###### 6 




What supports its foundations? Or who laid its cornerstone 









###### 7 




while the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy? 









###### 8 




Who enclosed the sea behind doors when it burst from the womb, 









###### 9 




when I made the clouds its garment and total darkness its blanket,[^b] 









###### 10 




when I determined its boundaries[^c] and put its bars and doors in place, 









###### 11 




when I declared, "You may come this far, but no farther; your proud waves stop here"? 









###### 12 




Have you ever in your life commanded the morning or assigned the dawn its place, 









###### 13 




so it may seize the edges of the earth and shake the wicked out of it? 









###### 14 




The earth is changed as clay is by a seal; its hills stand out like the folds of a garment. 









###### 15 




Light[^d] is withheld from the wicked, and the arm raised in violence is broken. 









###### 16 




Have you traveled to the sources of the sea or walked in the depths of the oceans? 









###### 17 




Have the gates of death been revealed to you? Have you seen the gates of deep darkness? 









###### 18 




Have you comprehended the extent of the earth? Tell me, if you know all this. 









###### 19 




Where is the road to the home of light? Do you know where darkness lives, 









###### 20 




so you can lead it back to its border? Are you familiar with the paths to its home? 









###### 21 




Don't you know? You were already born; you have lived so long![^e] 









###### 22 




Have you entered the place where the snow is stored? Or have you seen the storehouses of hail, 









###### 23 




which I hold in reserve for times of trouble, for the day of warfare and battle? 









###### 24 




What road leads to the place where light is dispersed?[^f] Where is the source of the east wind that spreads across the earth? 









###### 25 




Who cuts a channel for the flooding rain or clears the way for lightning, 









###### 26 




to bring rain on an uninhabited land, on a desert with no human life,[^g] 









###### 27 




to satisfy the parched wasteland and cause the grass to sprout? 









###### 28 




Does the rain have a father? Who fathered the drops of dew? 









###### 29 




Whose womb did the ice come from? Who gave birth to the frost of heaven 









###### 30 




when water becomes as hard as stone,[^h] and the surface of the watery depths is frozen? 









###### 31 




Can you fasten the chains of the Pleiades or loosen the belt of Orion? 









###### 32 




Can you bring out the constellations[^i] in their season and lead the Bear[^j] and her cubs? 









###### 33 




Do you know the laws of heaven? Can you impose its[^k] authority on earth? 









###### 34 




Can you command[^l] the clouds so that a flood of water covers you? 









###### 35 




Can you send out lightning bolts, and they go? Do they report to you, "Here we are"? 









###### 36 




Who put wisdom in the heart[^m] or gave the mind understanding? 









###### 37 




Who has the wisdom to number the clouds? Or who can tilt the water jars of heaven 









###### 38 




when the dust hardens like cast metal and the clods of dirt stick together? 









###### 39 




Can you hunt prey for a lioness or satisfy the appetite of young lions 









###### 40 




when they crouch in their dens and lie in wait within their lairs? 









###### 41 




Who provides the raven's food when its young cry out to God and wander about for lack of food? ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

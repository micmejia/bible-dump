# Job 40

***










###### 1 




The Lord answered Job: 









###### 2 




Will the one who contends with the Almighty correct him? Let him who argues with God give an answer.[^a] 









###### 3 




Then Job answered the Lord: 









###### 4 




I am so insignificant. How can I answer you? I place my hand over my mouth. 









###### 5 




I have spoken once, and I will not reply; twice, but now I can add nothing. 









###### 6 




Then the Lord answered Job from the whirlwind: 









###### 7 




Get ready to answer me like a man; when I question you, you will inform me. 









###### 8 




Would you really challenge my justice? Would you declare me guilty to justify yourself? 









###### 9 




Do you have an arm like God's? Can you thunder with a voice like his? 









###### 10 




Adorn yourself with majesty and splendor, and clothe yourself with honor and glory. 









###### 11 




Pour out your raging anger; look on every proud person and humiliate him. 









###### 12 




Look on every proud person and humble him; trample the wicked where they stand.[^b] 









###### 13 




Hide them together in the dust; imprison them in the grave.[^c] 









###### 14 




Then I will confess to you that your own right hand can deliver you. 









###### 15 




Look at Behemoth, which I made along with you. He eats grass like cattle. 









###### 16 




Look at the strength of his back[^d] and the power in the muscles of his belly. 









###### 17 




He stiffens his tail like a cedar tree; the tendons of his thighs are woven firmly together. 









###### 18 




His bones are bronze tubes; his limbs are like iron rods. 









###### 19 




He is the foremost of God's works; only his Maker can draw the sword against him. 









###### 20 




The hills yield food for him, while all sorts of wild animals play there. 









###### 21 




He lies under the lotus plants, hiding in the protection[^e] of marshy reeds. 









###### 22 




Lotus plants cover him with their shade; the willows by the brook surround him. 









###### 23 




Though the river rages, Behemoth is unafraid; he remains confident, even if the Jordan surges up to his mouth. 









###### 24 




Can anyone capture him while he looks on,[^f] or pierce his nose with snares? ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

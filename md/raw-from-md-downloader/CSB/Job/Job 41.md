# Job 41

***










###### 1 




Can you pull in Leviathan with a hook or tie his tongue down with a rope? 









###### 2 




Can you put a cord[^a] through his nose or pierce his jaw with a hook? 









###### 3 




Will he beg you for mercy or speak softly to you? 









###### 4 




Will he make a covenant with you so that you can take him as a slave forever? 









###### 5 




Can you play with him like a bird or put him on a leash[^b] for your girls? 









###### 6 




Will traders bargain for him or divide him among the merchants? 









###### 7 




Can you fill his hide with harpoons or his head with fishing spears? 









###### 8 




Lay a[^c] hand on him. You will remember the battle and never repeat it! 









###### 9 




Any hope of capturing him proves false. Does a person not collapse at the very sight of him? 









###### 10 




No one is ferocious enough to rouse Leviathan; who then can stand against me? 









###### 11 




Who confronted me, that I should repay him? Everything under heaven belongs to me. 









###### 12 




I cannot be silent about his limbs, his power, and his graceful proportions. 









###### 13 




Who can strip off his outer covering? Who can penetrate his double layer of armor?[^d] 









###### 14 




Who can open his jaws,[^e] surrounded by those terrifying teeth? 









###### 15 




His pride is in his rows of scales, closely sealed together. 









###### 16 




One scale is so close to another[^f] that no air can pass between them. 









###### 17 




They are joined to one another, so closely connected[^g] they cannot be separated. 









###### 18 




His snorting[^h] flashes with light, while his eyes are like the rays[^i] of dawn. 









###### 19 




Flaming torches shoot from his mouth; fiery sparks fly out! 









###### 20 




Smoke billows from his nostrils as from a boiling pot or burning reeds. 









###### 21 




His breath sets coals ablaze, and flames pour out of his mouth. 









###### 22 




Strength resides in his neck, and dismay dances before him. 









###### 23 




The folds of his flesh are joined together, solid as metal[^j] and immovable. 









###### 24 




His heart is as hard as a rock, as hard as a lower millstone! 









###### 25 




When Leviathan rises, the mighty[^k] are terrified; they withdraw because of his thrashing. 









###### 26 




The sword that reaches him will have no effect, nor will a spear, dart, or arrow. 









###### 27 




He regards iron as straw, and bronze as rotten wood. 









###### 28 




No arrow can make him flee; slingstones become like stubble to him. 









###### 29 




A club is regarded as stubble, and he laughs at the sound of a javelin. 









###### 30 




His undersides are jagged potsherds, spreading the mud like a threshing sledge. 









###### 31 




He makes the depths seethe like a cauldron; he makes the sea like an ointment jar. 









###### 32 




He leaves a shining wake behind him;[^l] one would think the deep had gray hair! 









###### 33 




He has no equal on earth-- a creature devoid of fear! 









###### 34 




He surveys everything that is haughty; he is king over all the proud beasts.[^m] ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

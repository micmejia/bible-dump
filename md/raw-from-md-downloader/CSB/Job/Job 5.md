# Job 5

***










###### 1 




Call out! Will anyone answer you? Which of the holy ones will you turn to? 









###### 2 




For anger kills a fool, and jealousy slays the gullible. 









###### 3 




I have seen a fool taking root, but I immediately pronounced a curse on his home. 









###### 4 




His children are far from safety. They are crushed at the city gate, with no one to rescue them. 









###### 5 




The hungry consume his harvest, even taking it out of the thorns.[^a] The thirsty[^b] pant for his children's wealth. 









###### 6 




For distress does not grow out of the soil, and trouble does not sprout from the ground. 









###### 7 




But humans are born for trouble as surely as sparks fly upward. 









###### 8 




However, if I were you, I would appeal to God and would present my case to him. 









###### 9 




He does great and unsearchable things, wonders without number. 









###### 10 




He gives rain to the earth and sends water to the fields. 









###### 11 




He sets the lowly on high, and mourners are lifted to safety. 









###### 12 




He frustrates the schemes of the crafty so that they[^c] achieve no success. 









###### 13 




He traps the wise in their craftiness so that the plans of the deceptive are quickly brought to an end. 









###### 14 




They encounter darkness by day, and they grope at noon as if it were night. 









###### 15 




He saves the needy from their sharp words[^d] and from the clutches of the powerful. 









###### 16 




So the poor have hope, and injustice shuts its mouth. 









###### 17 




See how happy is the person whom God corrects; so do not reject the discipline of the Almighty. 









###### 18 




For he wounds but he also bandages; he strikes, but his hands also heal. 









###### 19 




He will rescue you from six calamities; no harm will touch you in seven. 









###### 20 




In famine he will redeem you from death, and in battle, from the power of the sword. 









###### 21 




You will be safe from slander[^e] and not fear destruction when it comes. 









###### 22 




You will laugh at destruction and hunger and not fear the land's wild creatures. 









###### 23 




For you will have a covenant with the stones of the field, and the wild animals will be at peace with you. 









###### 24 




You will know that your tent is secure, and nothing will be missing when you inspect your home. 









###### 25 




You will also know that your offspring will be many and your descendants like the grass of the earth. 









###### 26 




You will approach the grave in full vigor, as a stack of sheaves is gathered in its season. 









###### 27

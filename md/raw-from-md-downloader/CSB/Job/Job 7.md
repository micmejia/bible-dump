# Job 7

***










###### 1 




Isn't each person consigned to forced labor on earth? Are not his days like those of a hired worker? 









###### 2 




Like a slave he longs for shade; like a hired worker he waits for his pay. 









###### 3 




So I have been made to inherit months of futility, and troubled nights have been assigned to me. 









###### 4 




When I lie down I think, "When will I get up?" But the evening drags on endlessly, and I toss and turn until dawn. 









###### 5 




My flesh is clothed with maggots and encrusted with dirt.[^a] My skin forms scabs[^b] and then oozes. 









###### 6 




My days pass more swiftly than a weaver's shuttle; they come to an end without hope. 









###### 7 




Remember that my life is but a breath. My eye will never again see anything good. 









###### 8 




The eye of anyone who looks on me will no longer see me. Your eyes will look for me, but I will be gone. 









###### 9 




As a cloud fades away and vanishes, so the one who goes down to Sheol will never rise again. 









###### 10 




He will never return to his house; his hometown will no longer remember[^c] him. 









###### 11 




Therefore I will not restrain my mouth. I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul. 









###### 12 




Am I the sea[^d] or a sea monster, that you keep me under guard? 









###### 13 




When I say, "My bed will comfort me, and my couch will ease my complaint," 









###### 14 




then you frighten me with dreams, and terrify me with visions, 









###### 15 




so that I prefer strangling[^e]-- death rather than life in this body.[^f] 









###### 16 




I give up! I will not live forever. Leave me alone, for my days are a breath.[^g] 









###### 17 




What is a mere human, that you think so highly of him and pay so much attention to him? 









###### 18 




You inspect him every morning, and put him to the test every moment. 









###### 19 




Will you ever look away from me, or leave me alone long enough to swallow?[^h] 









###### 20 




If I have sinned, what have I done to you, Watcher of humanity? Why have you made me your target, so that I have become a burden to you?[^i] 









###### 21 




Why not forgive my sin and pardon my iniquity? For soon I will lie down in the grave. You will eagerly seek me, but I will be gone. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

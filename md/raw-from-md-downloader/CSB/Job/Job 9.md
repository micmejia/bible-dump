# Job 9

***










###### 1 




Then Job answered: 









###### 2 




Yes, I know what you've said is true, but how can a person be justified before God? 









###### 3 




If one wanted to take him to court, he could not answer God[^a] once in a thousand times. 









###### 4 




God is wise and all-powerful. Who has opposed him and come out unharmed? 









###### 5 




He removes mountains without their knowledge, overturning them in his anger. 









###### 6 




He shakes the earth from its place so that its pillars tremble. 









###### 7 




He commands the sun not to shine and seals off the stars. 









###### 8 




He alone stretches out the heavens and treads on the waves of the sea.[^b] 









###### 9 




He makes the stars: the Bear,[^c] Orion, the Pleiades, and the constellations[^d] of the southern sky. 









###### 10 




He does great and unsearchable things, wonders without number. 









###### 11 




If he passed by me, I wouldn't see him; if he went by, I wouldn't recognize him. 









###### 12 




If he snatches something, who can stop[^e] him? Who can ask him, "What are you doing?" 









###### 13 




God does not hold back his anger; Rahab's assistants cringe in fear beneath him! 









###### 14 




How then can I answer him or choose my arguments against him? 









###### 15 




Even if I were in the right, I could not answer. I could only beg my Judge for mercy. 









###### 16 




If I summoned him and he answered me, I do not believe he would pay attention to what I said. 









###### 17 




He batters me with a whirlwind and multiplies my wounds without cause. 









###### 18 




He doesn't let me catch my breath but fills me with bitter experiences. 









###### 19 




If it is a matter of strength, look, he is the powerful one! If it is a matter of justice, who can summon him?[^f] 









###### 20 




Even if I were in the right, my own mouth would condemn me; if I were blameless, my mouth would declare me guilty. 









###### 21 




Though I am blameless, I no longer care about myself; I renounce my life. 









###### 22 




It is all the same. Therefore I say, "He destroys both the blameless and the wicked." 









###### 23 




When catastrophe[^g] brings sudden death, he mocks the despair of the innocent. 









###### 24 




The earth[^h] is handed over to the wicked; he blindfolds[^i] its judges. If it isn't he, then who is it? 









###### 25 




My days fly by faster than a runner;[^j] they flee without seeing any good. 









###### 26 




They sweep by like boats made of papyrus, like an eagle swooping down on its prey. 









###### 27 




If I said, "I will forget my complaint, change my expression, and smile," 









###### 28 




I would still live in terror of all my pains. I know you will not acquit me. 









###### 29 




Since I will be found guilty, why should I struggle in vain? 









###### 30 




If I wash myself with snow, and cleanse my hands with lye, 









###### 31 




then you dip me in a pit of mud, and my own clothes despise me! 









###### 32 




For he is not a man like me, that I can answer him, that we can take each other to court. 









###### 33 




There is no mediator between us, to lay his hand on both of us. 









###### 34 




Let him take his rod away from me so his terror will no longer frighten me. 









###### 35 




Then I would speak and not fear him. But that is not the case; I am on my own. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

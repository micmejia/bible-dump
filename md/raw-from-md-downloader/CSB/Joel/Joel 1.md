# Joel 1

***










###### 1 




The word of the Lord that came to Joel son of Pethuel: ## A Plague of Locusts 









###### 2 




Hear this, you elders; listen, all you inhabitants of the land. Has anything like this ever happened in your days or in the days of your ancestors? 









###### 3 




Tell your children about it, and let your children tell their children, and their children the next generation. 









###### 4 




What the devouring locust has left, the swarming locust has eaten; what the swarming locust has left, the young locust has eaten; and what the young locust has left, the destroying locust has eaten. 









###### 5 




Wake up, you drunkards, and weep; wail, all you wine drinkers, because of the sweet wine, for it has been taken from your mouth. 









###### 6 




For a nation has invaded my land, powerful and without number; its teeth are the teeth of a lion, and it has the fangs of a lioness. 









###### 7 




It has devastated my grapevine and splintered my fig tree. It has stripped off its bark and thrown it away; its branches have turned white. 









###### 8 




Grieve like a young woman dressed in sackcloth, mourning for the husband of her youth. 









###### 9 




Grain and drink offerings have been cut off from the house of the Lord; the priests, who are ministers of the Lord, mourn. 









###### 10 




The fields are destroyed; the land grieves; indeed, the grain is destroyed; the new wine is dried up; and the fresh oil fails. 









###### 11 




Be ashamed, you farmers, wail, you vinedressers,[^a] over the wheat and the barley, because the harvest of the field has perished. 









###### 12 




The grapevine is dried up, and the fig tree is withered; the pomegranate, the date palm, and the apple-- all the trees of the orchard--have withered. Indeed, human joy has dried up. 









###### 13 




Dress in sackcloth and lament, you priests; wail, you ministers of the altar. Come and spend the night in sackcloth, you ministers of my God, because grain and drink offerings are withheld from the house of your God. 









###### 14 




Announce a sacred fast; proclaim a solemn assembly! Gather the elders and all the residents of the land at the house of the Lord your God, and cry out to the Lord. ## The Day of the Lord 









###### 15 




Woe because of that day! For the day of the Lord is near and will come as devastation from the Almighty. 









###### 16 




Hasn't the food been cut off before our eyes, joy and gladness from the house of our God? 









###### 17 




The seeds lie shriveled in their casings.[^b] The storehouses are in ruin, and the granaries are broken down, because the grain has withered away. 









###### 18 




How the animals groan! The herds of cattle wander in confusion since they have no pasture. Even the flocks of sheep and goats suffer punishment. 









###### 19 




I call to you, Lord, for fire has consumed the pastures of the wilderness, and flames have devoured all the trees of the orchard. 









###### 20 




Even the wild animals cry out to[^c] you, for the river beds are dried up, and fire has consumed the pastures of the wilderness. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

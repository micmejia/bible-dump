# John 1

***










###### 1 




In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 









###### 2 




He was with God in the beginning. 









###### 3 




All things were created through him, and apart from him not one thing was created that has been created. 









###### 4 




In him was life,[^a] and that life was the light of men. 









###### 5 




That light shines in the darkness, and yet the darkness did not overcome[^b] it. 









###### 6 




There was a man sent from God whose name was John. 









###### 7 




He came as a witness to testify about the light, so that all might believe through him.[^c] 









###### 8 




He was not the light, but he came to testify about the light. 









###### 9 




The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world.[^d] 









###### 10 




He was in the world, and the world was created through him, and yet the world did not recognize him. 









###### 11 




He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him. 









###### 12 




But to all who did receive him, he gave them the right to be[^e] children of God, to those who believe in his name, 









###### 13 




who were born, not of natural descent,[^f] or of the will of the flesh, or of the will of man,[^g] but of God. 









###### 14 




The Word became flesh and dwelt[^h] among us. We observed his glory, the glory as the one and only Son[^i] from the Father, full of grace and truth. 









###### 15 




(John testified concerning him and exclaimed, "This was the one of whom I said, 'The one coming after me ranks ahead of me, because he existed before me.'") 









###### 16 




Indeed, we have all received grace upon[^j] grace from his fullness, 









###### 17 




for the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. 









###### 18 




No one has ever seen God. The one and only Son, who is himself God and is at the Father's side[^k]--he has revealed him. ## John the Baptist's Testimony 









###### 19 




This was John's testimony when the Jews from Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him, "Who are you?" 









###### 20 




He didn't deny it but confessed, "I am not the Messiah." 









###### 21 




"What then?" they asked him. "Are you Elijah?" "I am not," he said. "Are you the Prophet?" "No," he answered. 









###### 22 




"Who are you, then?" they asked. "We need to give an answer to those who sent us. What can you tell us about yourself?" 









###### 23 




He said, "I am a <b class="quote">voice of one crying out in the wilderness: Make straight the way of the Lord**[^l]--just as Isaiah the prophet said." 









###### 24 




Now they had been sent from the Pharisees. 









###### 25 




So they asked him, "Why then do you baptize if you aren't the Messiah, or Elijah, or the Prophet?" 









###### 26 




"I baptize with[^m] water," John answered them. "Someone stands among you, but you don't know him. 









###### 27 




He is the one coming after me,[^n] whose sandal strap I'm not worthy to untie." 









###### 28 




All this happened in Bethany[^o] across the Jordan, where John was baptizing. ## The Lamb of God 









###### 29 




The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, "Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! 









###### 30 




This is the one I told you about: 'After me comes a man who ranks ahead of me, because he existed before me.' 









###### 31 




I didn't know him, but I came baptizing with water so that he might be revealed to Israel." 









###### 32 




And John testified, "I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and he rested on him. 









###### 33 




I didn't know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water told me, 'The one you see the Spirit descending and resting on--he is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.' 









###### 34 




I have seen and testified that this is the Son of God."[^p] 









###### 35 




The next day, John was standing with two of his disciples. 









###### 36 




When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, "Look, the Lamb of God!" 









###### 37 




The two disciples heard him say this and followed Jesus. 









###### 38 




When Jesus turned and noticed them following him, he asked them, "What are you looking for?" They said to him, "Rabbi" (which means "Teacher"), "where are you staying?" 









###### 39 




"Come and you'll see," he replied. So they went and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day. It was about four in the afternoon.[^q] 









###### 40 




Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard John and followed him. 









###### 41 




He first found his own brother Simon and told him, "We have found the Messiah"[^r] (which is translated "the Christ"), 









###### 42 




and he brought Simon to Jesus. When Jesus saw him, he said, "You are Simon, son of John.[^s] You will be called Cephas" (which is translated "Peter"[^t]). ## Philip and Nathanael 









###### 43 




The next day Jesus[^u] decided to leave for Galilee. He found Philip and told him, "Follow me." 









###### 44 




Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the hometown of Andrew and Peter. 









###### 45 




Philip found Nathanael and told him, "We have found the one Moses wrote about in the law (and so did the prophets): Jesus the son of Joseph, from Nazareth." 









###### 46 




"Can anything good come out of Nazareth?" Nathanael asked him. "Come and see," Philip answered. 









###### 47 




Then Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said about him, "Here truly is an Israelite in whom there is no deceit." 









###### 48 




"How do you know me?" Nathanael asked. "Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you," Jesus answered. 









###### 49 




"Rabbi," Nathanael replied, "You are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel!" 









###### 50 




Jesus responded to him, "Do you believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than this." 









###### 51 




Then he said, "Truly I tell you, you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

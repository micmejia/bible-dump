# John 14

***










###### 1 




"Don't let your heart be troubled. Believe[^a] in God; believe also in me. 









###### 2 




In my Father's house are many rooms. If it were not so, would I have told you that I am going to prepare a place for you? 









###### 3 




If I go away and prepare a place for you, I will come again and take you to myself, so that where I am you may be also. 









###### 4 




You know the way to where I am going."[^b] 









###### 5 




"Lord," Thomas said, "we don't know where you're going. How can we know the way?" 









###### 6 




Jesus told him, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. 









###### 7 




If you know me, you will also know[^c] my Father. From now on you do know him and have seen him." ## Jesus Reveals the Father 









###### 8 




"Lord," said Philip, "show us the Father, and that's enough for us." 









###### 9 




Jesus said to him, "Have I been among you all this time and you do not know me, Philip? The one who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, 'Show us the Father'? 









###### 10 




Don't you believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words I speak to you I do not speak on my own. The Father who lives in me does his works. 









###### 11 




Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me. Otherwise, believe[^d] because of the works themselves. ## Praying in Jesus's Name 









###### 12 




"Truly I tell you, the one who believes in me will also do the works that I do. And he will do even greater works than these, because I am going to the Father. 









###### 13 




Whatever you ask in my name, I will do it so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. 









###### 14 




If you ask me[^e] anything in my name, I will do it.[^f] ## Another Counselor Promised 









###### 15 




"If you love me, you will keep[^g] my commands. 









###### 16 




And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Counselor[^h] to be with you forever. 









###### 17 




He is the Spirit of truth. The world is unable to receive him because it doesn't see him or know him. But you do know him, because he remains with you and will be[^i] in you. ## The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit 









###### 18 




"I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you. 









###### 19 




In a little while the world will no longer see me, but you will see me. Because I live, you will live too. 









###### 20 




On that day you will know that I am in my Father, you are in me, and I am in you. 









###### 21 




The one who has my commands and keeps them is the one who loves me. And the one who loves me will be loved by my Father. I also will love him and will reveal myself to him." 









###### 22 




Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, "Lord, how is it you're going to reveal yourself to us and not to the world?" 









###### 23 




Jesus answered, "If anyone loves me, he will keep my word. My Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him. 









###### 24 




The one who doesn't love me will not keep my words. The word that you hear is not mine but is from the Father who sent me. 









###### 25 




"I have spoken these things to you while I remain with you. 









###### 26 




But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and remind you of everything I have told you. ## Jesus's Gift of Peace 









###### 27 




"Peace I leave with you. My peace I give to you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Don't let your heart be troubled or fearful. 









###### 28 




You have heard me tell you, 'I am going away and I am coming to you.' If you loved me, you would rejoice that I am going to the Father, because the Father is greater than I. 









###### 29 




I have told you now before it happens so that when it does happen you may believe. 









###### 30 




I will not talk with you much longer, because the ruler of the world is coming. He has no power over me.[^j] 









###### 31 




On the contrary, so that the world may know that I love the Father, I do as the Father commanded me.

# John 2

***










###### 1 




On the third day a wedding took place in Cana of Galilee. Jesus's mother was there, 









###### 2 




and Jesus and his disciples were invited to the wedding as well. 









###### 3 




When the wine ran out, Jesus's mother told him, "They don't have any wine." 









###### 4 




"What has this concern of yours to do with me,[^a] woman?" Jesus asked. "My hour has not yet come." 









###### 5 




"Do whatever he tells you," his mother told the servants. 









###### 6 




Now six stone water jars had been set there for Jewish purification. Each contained twenty or thirty gallons.[^b] 









###### 7 




"Fill the jars with water," Jesus told them. So they filled them to the brim. 









###### 8 




Then he said to them, "Now draw some out and take it to the headwaiter."[^c] And they did. 









###### 9 




When the headwaiter tasted the water (after it had become wine), he did not know where it came from--though the servants who had drawn the water knew. He called the groom 









###### 10 




and told him, "Everyone sets out the fine wine first, then, after people are drunk, the inferior. But you have kept the fine wine until now." 









###### 11 




Jesus did this, the first of his signs, in Cana of Galilee. He revealed his glory, and his disciples believed in him. 









###### 12 




After this, he went down to Capernaum, together with his mother, his brothers, and his disciples, and they stayed there only a few days. ## Cleansing the Temple 









###### 13 




The Jewish Passover was near, and so Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 









###### 14 




In the temple he found people selling oxen, sheep, and doves, and he also found the money changers sitting there. 









###### 15 




After making a whip out of cords, he drove everyone out of the temple with their sheep and oxen. He also poured out the money changers' coins and overturned the tables. 









###### 16 




He told those who were selling doves, "Get these things out of here! Stop turning my Father's house into a marketplace!"[^d] 









###### 17 




And his disciples remembered that it is written: <b class="quote">Zeal** <b class="quote">for your house will consume** <b class="quote">me.**[^e] 









###### 18 




So the Jews replied to him, "What sign will you show us for doing these things?" 









###### 19 




Jesus answered, "Destroy this temple,[^f] and I will raise it up in three days." 









###### 20 




Therefore the Jews said, "This temple took forty-six years to build,[^g] and will you raise it up in three days?" 









###### 21 




But he was speaking about the temple of his body. 









###### 22 




So when he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they believed the Scripture and the statement Jesus had made. 









###### 23 




While he was in Jerusalem during the Passover Festival, many believed in his name when they saw the signs he was doing. 









###### 24 




Jesus, however, would not entrust himself to them, since he knew them all 









###### 25 




and because he did not need anyone to testify about man; for he himself knew what was in man. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

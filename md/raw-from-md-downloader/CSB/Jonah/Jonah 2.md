# Jonah 2

***










###### 1 




Jonah prayed to the Lord his God from the belly of the fish: 









###### 2 




I called to the Lord in my distress, and he answered me. I cried out for help from deep inside[^a] Sheol; you heard my voice. 









###### 3 




When you threw me into the depths, into the heart of the seas, the current[^b] overcame me. All your breakers and your billows swept over me. 









###### 4 




And I said, "I have been banished from your sight, yet I will look[^c] once more toward your holy temple." 









###### 5 




The water engulfed me up to the neck;[^d] the watery depths overcame me; seaweed was wrapped around my head. 









###### 6 




I sank to the foundations of the mountains, the earth's gates shut behind me forever! Then you raised my life from the Pit, Lord my God! 









###### 7 




As my life was fading away, I remembered the Lord, and my prayer came to you, to your holy temple. 









###### 8 




Those who cherish worthless idols abandon their faithful love, 









###### 9 




but as for me, I will sacrifice to you with a voice of thanksgiving. I will fulfill what I have vowed. Salvation[^e] belongs to the Lord. 









###### 10 




Then the Lord commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

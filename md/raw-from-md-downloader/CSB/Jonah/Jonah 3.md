# Jonah 3

***










###### 1 




The word of the Lord came to Jonah a second time: 









###### 2 




"Get up! Go to the great city of Nineveh and preach the message that I tell you." 









###### 3 




Jonah got up and went to Nineveh according to the Lord's command. Now Nineveh was an extremely great city,[^a] a three-day walk. 









###### 4 




Jonah set out on the first day of his walk in the city and proclaimed, "In forty days Nineveh will be demolished!" 









###### 5 




Then the people of Nineveh believed God. They proclaimed a fast and dressed in sackcloth--from the greatest of them to the least. 









###### 6 




When word reached the king of Nineveh, he got up from his throne, took off his royal robe, covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in ashes. 









###### 7 




Then he issued a decree in Nineveh: By order of the king and his nobles: No person or animal, herd or flock, is to taste anything at all. They must not eat or drink water. 









###### 8 




Furthermore, both people and animals must be covered with sackcloth, and everyone must call out earnestly to God. Each must turn from his evil ways and from his wrongdoing.[^b] 









###### 9 




Who knows? God may turn and relent; he may turn from his burning anger so that we will not perish. 









###### 10 




God saw their actions--that they had turned from their evil ways--so God relented from the disaster he had threatened them with. And he did not do it. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Judges 5

***










###### 1 




On that day Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang: 









###### 2 




When the leaders lead[^a] in Israel, when the people volunteer, blessed be the Lord. 









###### 3 




Listen, kings! Pay attention, princes! I will sing to the Lord; I will sing praise to the Lord God of Israel. 









###### 4 




Lord, when you came from Seir, when you marched from the fields of Edom, the earth trembled, the skies poured rain, and the clouds poured water. 









###### 5 




The mountains melted before the Lord, even Sinai,[^b] before the Lord, the God of Israel. 









###### 6 




In the days of Shamgar son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the main roads were deserted because travelers kept to the side roads. 









###### 7 




Villages were deserted,[^c] they were deserted in Israel, until I,[^d] Deborah, arose, a mother in Israel. 









###### 8 




Israel chose new gods, then there was war in the city gates. Not a shield or spear was seen among forty thousand in Israel. 









###### 9 




My heart is with the leaders of Israel, with the volunteers of the people. Blessed be the Lord! 









###### 10 




You who ride on white[^e] donkeys, who sit on saddle blankets, and who travel on the road, give praise! 









###### 11 




Let them tell the righteous acts of the Lord, the righteous deeds of his villagers in Israel, with the voices of the singers at the watering places.[^f] Then the Lord's people went down to the city gates. 









###### 12 




"Awake! Awake, Deborah! Awake! Awake, sing a song! Arise, Barak, and take your prisoners, son of Abinoam!" 









###### 13 




Then the survivors came down to the nobles; the Lord's people came down to me[^g] against the warriors. 









###### 14 




Those with their roots in Amalek[^h] came from Ephraim; Benjamin came with your people after you. The leaders came down from Machir, and those who carry a marshal's staff came from Zebulun. 









###### 15 




The princes of Issachar were with Deborah; Issachar was with Barak; they were under his leadership[^i] in the valley. There was great searching[^j] of heart among the clans of Reuben. 









###### 16 




Why did you sit among the sheep pens[^k] listening to the playing of pipes for the flocks? There was great searching of heart among the clans of Reuben. 









###### 17 




Gilead remained beyond the Jordan. Dan, why did you linger at the ships? Asher remained at the seashore and stayed in his harbors. 









###### 18 




The people of Zebulun defied death, Naphtali also, on the heights of the battlefield. 









###### 19 




Kings came and fought. Then the kings of Canaan fought at Taanach by the Waters of Megiddo, but they did not plunder the silver. 









###### 20 




The stars fought from the heavens; the stars fought with Sisera from their paths. 









###### 21 




The river Kishon swept them away, the ancient river, the river Kishon. March on, my soul, in strength! 









###### 22 




The horses' hooves then hammered-- the galloping, galloping of his[^l] stallions. 









###### 23 




"Curse Meroz," says the angel of the Lord, "Bitterly curse her inhabitants, for they did not come to help the Lord, to help the Lord with the warriors." 









###### 24 




Most blessed of women is Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite; she is most blessed among tent-dwelling women. 









###### 25 




He asked for water; she gave him milk. She brought him cream in a majestic bowl. 









###### 26 




She reached for a tent peg, her right hand, for a workman's hammer. Then she hammered Sisera-- she crushed his head; she shattered and pierced his temple. 









###### 27 




He collapsed, he fell, he lay down between her feet; he collapsed, he fell between her feet; where he collapsed, there he fell--dead. 









###### 28 




Sisera's mother looked through the window; she peered through the lattice, crying out: "Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why don't I hear the hoofbeats of his horses?" [^m] 









###### 29 




Her wisest princesses answer her; she even answers herself: 









###### 30 




"Are they not finding and dividing the spoil-- a girl or two[^n] for each warrior, the spoil of colored garments for Sisera, the spoil of an embroidered garment or two for my neck?" [^o] 









###### 31 




Lord, may all your enemies perish as Sisera did.[^p] But may those who love him be like the rising of the sun in its strength. And the land had peace for forty years. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

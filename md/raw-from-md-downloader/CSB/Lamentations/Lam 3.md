# Lamentations 3

***










###### 1 




I am the man who has seen affliction under the rod of God's wrath. 









###### 2 




He has driven me away and forced me to walk in darkness instead of light. 









###### 3 




Yes, he repeatedly turns his hand against me all day long. 









###### 4 




He has worn away my flesh and skin; he has broken my bones. 









###### 5 




He has laid siege against me, encircling me with bitterness and hardship. 









###### 6 




He has made me dwell in darkness like those who have been dead for ages. 









###### 7 




He has walled me in so I cannot get out; he has weighed me down with chains. 









###### 8 




Even when I cry out and plead for help, he blocks out my prayer. 









###### 9 




He has walled in my ways with blocks of stone; he has made my paths crooked. 









###### 10 




He is[^a] a bear waiting in ambush, a lion in hiding. 









###### 11 




He forced me off my way and tore me to pieces; he left me desolate. 









###### 12 




He strung his bow and set me as the target for his arrow. 









###### 13 




He pierced my kidneys with shafts from his quiver. 









###### 14 




I am a laughingstock to all my people,[^b] mocked by their songs all day long. 









###### 15 




He filled me with bitterness, satiated me with wormwood. 









###### 16 




He ground my teeth with gravel and made me cower[^c] in the dust. 









###### 17 




I have been deprived[^d] of peace; I have forgotten what prosperity is. 









###### 18 




Then I thought, "My future[^e] is lost, as well as my hope from the Lord." 









###### 19 




Remember[^f] my affliction and my homelessness, the wormwood and the poison. 









###### 20 




I continually remember them and have become depressed.[^g] 









###### 21 




Yet I call this to mind, and therefore I have hope: 









###### 22 




Because of the Lord's faithful love we do not perish,[^h] for his mercies never end. 









###### 23 




They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness! 









###### 24 




I say, "The Lord is my portion, therefore I will put my hope in him." 









###### 25 




The Lord is good to those who wait for him, to the person who seeks him. 









###### 26 




It is good to wait quietly for salvation from the Lord. 









###### 27 




It is good for a man to bear the yoke while he is still young. 









###### 28 




Let him sit alone and be silent, for God has disciplined[^i] him. 









###### 29 




Let him put his mouth in the dust-- perhaps there is still hope. 









###### 30 




Let him offer his cheek to the one who would strike him; let him be filled with disgrace. 









###### 31 




For the Lord will not reject us forever. 









###### 32 




Even if he causes suffering, he will show compassion according to the abundance of his faithful love. 









###### 33 




For he does not enjoy bringing affliction or suffering on mankind. 









###### 34 




Crushing all the prisoners of the land[^j] beneath one's feet, 









###### 35 




denying justice to a man in the presence of the Most High, 









###### 36 




or subverting a person in his lawsuit-- the Lord does not approve of these things. 









###### 37 




Who is there who speaks and it happens, unless the Lord has ordained it? 









###### 38 




Do not both adversity and good come from the mouth of the Most High? 









###### 39 




Why should any living person complain, any man, because of the punishment for his sins? 









###### 40 




Let's examine and probe our ways, and turn back to the Lord. 









###### 41 




Let's lift up our hearts and our hands to God in heaven: 









###### 42 




"We have sinned and rebelled; you have not forgiven. 









###### 43 




"You have covered yourself in anger and pursued us; you have killed without compassion. 









###### 44 




You have covered yourself with a cloud so that no prayer can get through. 









###### 45 




You have made us disgusting filth among the peoples. 









###### 46 




"All our enemies open their mouths against us. 









###### 47 




We have experienced panic and pitfall, devastation and destruction." 









###### 48 




My eyes flow with streams of tears because of the destruction of my dear people. 









###### 49 




My eyes overflow unceasingly, without end, 









###### 50 




until the Lord looks down from heaven and sees. 









###### 51 




My eyes bring me grief because of the fate of all the women in my city. 









###### 52 




For no reason, my enemies[^k] hunted me like a bird. 









###### 53 




They smothered my life in[^l] a pit and threw stones on me. 









###### 54 




Water flooded over my head, and I thought, "I'm going to die!" 









###### 55 




I called on your name, Lord, from the depths of the pit. 









###### 56 




You heard my plea: Do not ignore my cry for relief. 









###### 57 




You came near whenever I called you; you said, "Do not be afraid." 









###### 58 




You championed my cause, Lord; you redeemed my life. 









###### 59 




Lord, you saw the wrong done to me; judge my case. 









###### 60 




You saw all their vengefulness, all their plots against me. 









###### 61 




Lord, you heard their insults, all their plots against me. 









###### 62 




The slander[^m] and murmuring of my opponents attack me all day long. 









###### 63 




When they sit and when they rise, look, I am mocked by their songs. 









###### 64 




You will pay them back what they deserve, Lord, according to the work of their hands. 









###### 65 




You will give them a heart filled with anguish.[^n] May your curse be on them! 









###### 66 




You will pursue them in anger and destroy them under your heavens.[^o] ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Lamentations 4

***










###### 1 




How the gold has become tarnished, the fine gold become dull! The stones of the temple[^a] lie scattered at the head of every street. 









###### 2 




Zion's precious children-- once worth their weight in pure gold-- how they are regarded as clay jars, the work of a potter's hands! 









###### 3 




Even jackals offer their breasts to nurse their young, but my dear people have become cruel like ostriches in the wilderness. 









###### 4 




The nursing baby's tongue clings to the roof of his mouth from thirst. Infants beg for food, but no one gives them any. 









###### 5 




Those who used to eat delicacies are destitute in the streets; those who were reared in purple garments huddle in trash heaps. 









###### 6 




The punishment of my dear people is greater than that of Sodom, which was overthrown in an instant without a hand laid on it. 









###### 7 




Her dignitaries were brighter than snow, whiter than milk; their bodies[^b] were more ruddy than coral, their appearance like lapis lazuli. 









###### 8 




Now they appear darker than soot; they are not recognized in the streets. Their skin has shriveled on their bones; it has become dry like wood. 









###### 9 




Those slain by the sword are better off than those slain by hunger, who waste away, pierced with pain because the fields lack produce. 









###### 10 




The hands of compassionate women have cooked their own children; they became their food during the destruction of my dear people. 









###### 11 




The Lord has exhausted his wrath, poured out his burning anger; he has ignited a fire in Zion, and it has consumed her foundations. 









###### 12 




The kings of the earth and all the world's inhabitants did not believe that an enemy or adversary could enter Jerusalem's gates. 









###### 13 




Yet it happened because of the sins of her prophets and the iniquities of her priests, who shed the blood of the righteous within her. 









###### 14 




Blind, they stumbled in the streets, defiled by this blood, so that no one dared to touch their garments. 









###### 15 




"Stay away! Unclean!" people shouted at them. "Away, away! Don't touch us!" So they wandered aimlessly. It was said among the nations, "They can stay here no longer." 









###### 16 




The Lord himself has scattered them; he no longer watches over them. The priests are not respected; the elders find no favor. 









###### 17 




All the while our eyes were failing as we looked in vain for help; we watched from our towers for a nation that would not save us. 









###### 18 




Our steps were closely followed so that we could not walk in our streets. Our end approached; our time ran out. Our end had come! 









###### 19 




Those who chased us were swifter than eagles in the sky; they relentlessly pursued us over the mountains and ambushed us in the wilderness. 









###### 20 




The Lord's anointed, the breath of our life,[^c] was captured in their traps. We had said about him, "We will live under his protection among the nations." 









###### 21 




So rejoice and be glad, Daughter Edom, you resident of the land of Uz! Yet the cup will pass to you as well; you will get drunk and expose yourself. 









###### 22 




Daughter Zion, your punishment is complete; he will not lengthen your exile.[^d] But he will punish your iniquity, Daughter Edom, and will expose your sins. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

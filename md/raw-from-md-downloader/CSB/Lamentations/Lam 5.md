# Lamentations 5

***










###### 1 




Lord, remember what has happened to us. Look, and see our disgrace! 









###### 2 




Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, our houses to foreigners. 









###### 3 




We have become orphans, fatherless; our mothers are widows. 









###### 4 




We must pay for the water we drink; our wood comes at a price. 









###### 5 




We are closely pursued; we are tired, and no one offers us rest. 









###### 6 




We made a treaty with[^a] Egypt and with Assyria, to get enough food. 









###### 7 




Our ancestors sinned; they no longer exist, but we bear their punishment. 









###### 8 




Slaves rule over us; no one rescues us from them. 









###### 9 




We secure our food at the risk of our lives because of the sword in the wilderness. 









###### 10 




Our skin is as hot[^b] as an oven from the ravages of hunger. 









###### 11 




Women have been raped in Zion, virgins in the cities of Judah. 









###### 12 




Princes have been hung up by their hands; elders are shown no respect. 









###### 13 




Young men labor at millstones; boys stumble under loads of wood. 









###### 14 




The elders have left the city gate, the young men, their music. 









###### 15 




Joy has left our hearts; our dancing has turned to mourning. 









###### 16 




The crown has fallen from our head. Woe to us, for we have sinned. 









###### 17 




Because of this, our heart is sick; because of these, our eyes grow dim: 









###### 18 




because of Mount Zion, which lies desolate and has jackals prowling in it. 









###### 19 




You, Lord, are enthroned forever; your throne endures from generation to generation. 









###### 20 




Why do you continually forget us, abandon us for our entire lives? 









###### 21 




Lord, bring us back to yourself, so we may return; renew our days as in former times, 









###### 22

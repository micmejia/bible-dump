# Leviticus 1

***










###### 1 




Then the Lord summoned Moses and spoke to him from the tent of meeting: 









###### 2 




"Speak to the Israelites and tell them: When any of you brings an offering to the Lord from the livestock, you may bring your offering from the herd or the flock. 









###### 3 




"If his offering is a burnt offering from the herd, he is to bring an unblemished male. He will bring it to the entrance to the tent of meeting so that he[^a] may be accepted by the Lord. 









###### 4 




He is to lay his hand on the head of the burnt offering so it can be accepted on his behalf to make atonement for him. 









###### 5 




He is to slaughter the bull before the Lord; Aaron's sons the priests are to present the blood and splatter it on all sides of the altar that is at the entrance to the tent of meeting. 









###### 6 




Then he is to skin the burnt offering and cut it into pieces.[^b] 









###### 7 




The sons of Aaron the priest will prepare a fire on the altar and arrange wood on the fire. 









###### 8 




Aaron's sons the priests are to arrange the pieces, the head, and the fat on top of the burning wood on the altar. 









###### 9 




The offerer is to wash its entrails and legs with water. Then the priest will burn all of it on the altar as a burnt offering, a food offering, a pleasing aroma to the Lord. 









###### 10 




"But if his offering for a burnt offering is from the flock, from sheep or goats, he is to present an unblemished male. 









###### 11 




He will slaughter it on the north side of the altar before the Lord. Aaron's sons the priests will splatter its blood against the altar on all sides. 









###### 12 




He will cut the animal into pieces with its head and its fat, and the priest will arrange them on top of the burning wood on the altar. 









###### 13 




But he is to wash the entrails and legs with water. The priest will then present all of it and burn it on the altar; it is a burnt offering, a food offering, a pleasing aroma to the Lord. 









###### 14 




"If his offering to the Lord is a burnt offering of birds, he is to present his offering from the turtledoves or young pigeons.[^c] 









###### 15 




Then the priest is to bring it to the altar, and will twist off its head and burn it on the altar; its blood should be drained at the side of the altar. 









###### 16 




He will remove its digestive tract,[^d] cutting off the tail feathers, and throw it on the east side of the altar at the place for ashes. 









###### 17 




He will tear it open by its wings without dividing the bird. Then the priest is to burn it on the altar on top of the burning wood. It is a burnt offering, a food offering, a pleasing aroma to the Lord. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

###### 1 




"When anyone presents a grain offering as an offering to the Lord, it is to consist of fine flour. He is to pour olive oil on it, put frankincense on it, 









###### 2 




and bring it to Aaron's sons the priests. The priest will take a handful of fine flour and oil from it, along with all its frankincense, and will burn this memorial portion of it on the altar, a food offering, a pleasing aroma to the Lord. 









###### 3 




But the rest of the grain offering will belong to Aaron and his sons; it is the holiest part of the food offerings to the Lord. 









###### 4 




"When you present a grain offering baked in an oven, it is to be made of fine flour, either unleavened cakes mixed with oil or unleavened wafers coated with oil. 









###### 5 




If your offering is a grain offering prepared on a griddle, it is to be unleavened bread made of fine flour mixed with oil. 









###### 6 




Break it into pieces and pour oil on it; it is a grain offering. 









###### 7 




If your offering is a grain offering prepared in a pan, it is to be made of fine flour with oil. 









###### 8 




When you bring to the Lord the grain offering made in any of these ways, it is to be presented to the priest, and he will take it to the altar. 









###### 9 




The priest will remove the memorial portion[^a] from the grain offering and burn it on the altar, a food offering, a pleasing aroma to the Lord. 









###### 10 




But the rest of the grain offering will belong to Aaron and his sons; it is the holiest part of the food offerings to the Lord. 









###### 11 




"No grain offering that you present to the Lord is to be made with yeast, for you are not to burn[^b] any yeast or honey as a food offering to the Lord. 









###### 12 




You may present them to the Lord as an offering of firstfruits, but they are not to be offered on the altar as a pleasing aroma. 









###### 13 




You are to season each of your grain offerings with salt; you must not omit from your grain offering the salt of the covenant with your God. You are to present salt with each of your offerings. 









###### 14 




"If you present a grain offering of firstfruits to the Lord, you are to present fresh heads of grain, crushed kernels, roasted on the fire, for your grain offering of firstfruits. 









###### 15 




You are to put oil and frankincense on it; it is a grain offering. 









###### 16 




The priest will then burn some of its crushed kernels and oil with all its frankincense as a food offering to the Lord. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

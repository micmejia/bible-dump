# Luke 15

***










###### 1 




All the tax collectors and sinners were approaching to listen to him. 









###### 2 




And the Pharisees and scribes were complaining, "This man welcomes sinners and eats with them." 









###### 3 




So he told them this parable: 









###### 4 




"What man among you, who has a hundred sheep and loses one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the open field[^a] and go after the lost one until he finds it? 









###### 5 




When he has found it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders, 









###### 6 




and coming home, he calls his friends and neighbors together, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, because I have found my lost sheep!' 









###### 7 




I tell you, in the same way, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who don't need repentance. ## The Parable of the Lost Coin 









###### 8 




"Or what woman who has ten silver coins,[^b][^c] if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp, sweep the house, and search carefully until she finds it? 









###### 9 




When she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors together, saying, 'Rejoice with me, because I have found the silver coin I lost!' 









###### 10 




I tell you, in the same way, there is joy in the presence of God's angels over one sinner who repents." ## The Parable of the Lost Son 









###### 11 




He also said, "A man had two sons. 









###### 12 




The younger of them said to his father, 'Father, give me the share of the estate I have coming to me.' So he distributed the assets[^d] to them. 









###### 13 




Not many days later, the younger son gathered together all he had and traveled to a distant country, where he squandered his estate in foolish living. 









###### 14 




After he had spent everything, a severe famine struck that country, and he had nothing.[^e] 









###### 15 




Then he went to work for one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed pigs. 









###### 16 




He longed to eat his fill from[^f] the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one would give him anything. 









###### 17 




When he came to his senses,[^g] he said, 'How many of my father's hired workers have more than enough food, and here I am dying of hunger![^h] 









###### 18 




I'll get up, go to my father, and say to him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight. 









###### 19 




I'm no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired workers."' 









###### 20 




So he got up and went to his father. But while the son was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion. He ran, threw his arms around his neck, and kissed him. 









###### 21 




The son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight. I'm no longer worthy to be called your son.' 









###### 22 




"But the father told his servants, 'Quick! Bring out the best robe and put it on him; put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. 









###### 23 




Then bring the fattened calf and slaughter it, and let's celebrate with a feast, 









###### 24 




because this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found!' So they began to celebrate. 









###### 25 




"Now his older son was in the field; as he came near the house, he heard music and dancing. 









###### 26 




So he summoned one of the servants, questioning what these things meant. 









###### 27 




'Your brother is here,' he told him, 'and your father has slaughtered the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.'[^i] 









###### 28 




"Then he became angry and didn't want to go in. So his father came out and pleaded with him. 









###### 29 




But he replied to his father, 'Look, I have been slaving many years for you, and I have never disobeyed your orders, yet you never gave me a goat so that I could celebrate with my friends. 









###### 30 




But when this son of yours came, who has devoured your assets[^j] with prostitutes, you slaughtered the fattened calf for him.' 









###### 31 




"'Son,'[^k] he said to him, 'you are always with me, and everything I have is yours. 









###### 32 




But we had to celebrate and rejoice, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.'" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

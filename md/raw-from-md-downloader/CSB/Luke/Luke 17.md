# Luke 17

***










###### 1 




He said to his disciples, "Offenses will certainly come,[^a] but woe to the one through whom they come! 









###### 2 




It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea than for him to cause one of these little ones to stumble. 









###### 3 




Be on your guard. If your brother sins,[^b] rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him. 









###### 4 




And if he sins against you seven times in a day, and comes back to you seven times, saying, 'I repent,' you must forgive him." ## Faith and Duty 









###### 5 




The apostles said to the Lord, "Increase our faith." 









###### 6 




"If you have faith the size of[^c] a mustard seed," the Lord said, "you can say to this mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted and planted in the sea,' and it will obey you. 









###### 7 




"Which one of you having a servant tending sheep or plowing will say to him when he comes in from the field, 'Come at once and sit down to eat'? 









###### 8 




Instead, will he not tell him, 'Prepare something for me to eat, get ready, and serve me while I eat and drink; later you can eat and drink'? 









###### 9 




Does he thank that servant because he did what was commanded?[^d] 









###### 10 




In the same way, when you have done all that you were commanded, you should say, 'We are unworthy servants; we've only done our duty.'" ## Ten Men Healed 









###### 11 




While traveling to Jerusalem, he passed between[^e] Samaria and Galilee. 









###### 12 




As he entered a village, ten men with leprosy[^f] met him. They stood at a distance 









###### 13 




and raised their voices, saying, "Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!" 









###### 14 




When he saw them, he told them, "Go and show yourselves to the priests." And while they were going, they were cleansed. 









###### 15 




But one of them, seeing that he was healed, returned and, with a loud voice, gave glory to God. 









###### 16 




He fell facedown at his feet, thanking him. And he was a Samaritan. 









###### 17 




Then Jesus said, "Were not ten cleansed? Where are the nine? 









###### 18 




Didn't any return to give glory to God except this foreigner?" 









###### 19 




And he told him, "Get up and go on your way. Your faith has saved you."[^g] ## The Coming of the Kingdom 









###### 20 




When he was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, he answered them, "The kingdom of God is not coming with something observable; 









###### 21 




no one will say,[^h] 'See here!' or 'There!' For you see, the kingdom of God is in your midst."[^i] 









###### 22 




Then he told the disciples, "The days are coming when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you won't see it. 









###### 23 




They will say to you, 'See there!' or 'See here!' Don't follow or run after them. 









###### 24 




For as the lightning flashes from horizon to horizon and lights up the sky, so the Son of Man will be in his day. 









###### 25 




But first it is necessary that he suffer many things and be rejected by this generation. 









###### 26 




"Just as it was in the days of Noah, so it will be in the days of the Son of Man: 









###### 27 




People went on eating, drinking, marrying and being given in marriage until the day Noah boarded the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all. 









###### 28 




It will be the same as it was in the days of Lot: People went on eating, drinking, buying, selling, planting, building. 









###### 29 




But on the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained from heaven and destroyed them all. 









###### 30 




It will be like that on the day the Son of Man is revealed. 









###### 31 




On that day, a man on the housetop, whose belongings are in the house, must not come down to get them. Likewise the man who is in the field must not turn back. 









###### 32 




Remember Lot's wife! 









###### 33 




Whoever tries to make his life secure[^j][^k] will lose it, and whoever loses his life will preserve it. 









###### 34 




I tell you, on that night two will be in one bed; one will be taken and the other will be left. 









###### 35 




Two women will be grinding grain together; one will be taken and the other left."[^l] 









###### 37 




"Where, Lord?" they asked him. He said to them, "Where the corpse is, there also the vultures will be gathered." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

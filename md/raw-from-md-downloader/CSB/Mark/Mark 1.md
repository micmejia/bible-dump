# Mark 1

***










###### 1 




The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.[^a] 









###### 2 




As it is written in Isaiah the prophet:[^b] <b class="quote">See, I am sending my messenger** <b class="quote">ahead of you;** <b class="quote">he will prepare your way.**[^c][^d] 









###### 3 




<b class="quote">A voice of one crying out in the wilderness:** <b class="quote">Prepare the way for the Lord;** <b class="quote">make his paths straight!**[^e] 









###### 4 




John came baptizing[^f] in the wilderness and proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. 









###### 5 




The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem were going out to him, and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins. 









###### 6 




John wore a camel-hair garment with a leather belt around his waist and ate locusts and wild honey. 









###### 7 




He proclaimed, "One who is more powerful than I am is coming after me. I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the strap of his sandals. 









###### 8 




I baptize you with[^g] water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." ## The Baptism of Jesus 









###### 9 




In those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized in the Jordan by John. 









###### 10 




As soon as he came up out of the water, he saw the heavens being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. 









###### 11 




And a voice came from heaven: "You are my beloved Son; with you I am well-pleased." ## The Temptation of Jesus 









###### 12 




Immediately the Spirit drove him into the wilderness. 









###### 13 




He was in the wilderness forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and the angels were serving him. ## Ministry in Galilee 









###### 14 




After John was arrested, Jesus went to Galilee, proclaiming the good news[^h][^i] of God: 









###### 15 




"The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!" ## The First Disciples 









###### 16 




As he passed alongside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew, Simon's brother, casting a net into the sea--for they were fishermen. 









###### 17 




"Follow me," Jesus told them, "and I will make you fish for[^j] people." 









###### 18 




Immediately they left their nets and followed him. 









###### 19 




Going on a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat putting their nets in order. 









###### 20 




Immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him. ## Driving Out an Unclean Spirit 









###### 21 




They went into Capernaum, and right away he entered the synagogue on the Sabbath and began to teach. 









###### 22 




They were astonished at his teaching because he was teaching them as one who had authority, and not like the scribes. 









###### 23 




Just then a man with an unclean spirit was in their synagogue. He cried out, 









###### 24 




"What do you have to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are--the Holy One of God!" 









###### 25 




Jesus rebuked him saying, "Be silent, and come out of him!" 









###### 26 




And the unclean spirit threw him into convulsions, shouted with a loud voice, and came out of him. 









###### 27 




They were all amazed, and so they began to ask each other, "What is this? A new teaching with authority![^k] He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him." 









###### 28 




At once the news about him spread throughout the entire vicinity of Galilee. ## Healings at Capernaum 









###### 29 




As soon as they left the synagogue, they went into Simon and Andrew's house with James and John. 









###### 30 




Simon's mother-in-law was lying in bed with a fever, and they told him about her at once. 









###### 31 




So he went to her, took her by the hand, and raised her up. The fever left her,[^l] and she began to serve them. 









###### 32 




When evening came, after the sun had set, they brought to him all those who were sick and demon-possessed. 









###### 33 




The whole town was assembled at the door, 









###### 34 




and he healed many who were sick with various diseases and drove out many demons. And he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him. ## Preaching in Galilee 









###### 35 




Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, he got up, went out, and made his way to a deserted place; and there he was praying. 









###### 36 




Simon and his companions searched for him, 









###### 37 




and when they found him they said, "Everyone is looking for you." 









###### 38 




And he said to them, "Let's go on to the neighboring villages so that I may preach there too. This is why I have come." ## A Man Cleansed 









###### 39 




He went into all of Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons. 









###### 40 




Then a man with leprosy[^m] came to him and, on his knees,[^n] begged him, "If you are willing, you can make me clean." 









###### 41 




Moved with compassion,[^o] Jesus reached out his hand and touched him. "I am willing," he told him. "Be made clean." 









###### 42 




Immediately the leprosy left him, and he was made clean. 









###### 43 




Then he sternly warned him and sent him away at once, 









###### 44 




telling him, "See that you say nothing to anyone; but go and show yourself to the priest, and offer what Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them."[^p] 









###### 45 




Yet he went out and began to proclaim it widely and to spread the news, with the result that Jesus could no longer enter a town openly. But he was out in deserted places, and they came to him from everywhere. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

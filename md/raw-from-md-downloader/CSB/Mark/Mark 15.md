# Mark 15

***










###### 1 




As soon as it was morning, having held a meeting with the elders, scribes, and the whole Sanhedrin, the chief priests tied Jesus up, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate. 









###### 2 




So Pilate asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?" He answered him, "You say so." 









###### 3 




And the chief priests accused him of many things. 









###### 4 




Pilate questioned him again, "Aren't you going to answer? Look how many things they are accusing you of!" 









###### 5 




But Jesus still did not answer, and so Pilate was amazed. ## Jesus or Barabbas 









###### 6 




At the festival Pilate used to release for the people a prisoner whom they requested. 









###### 7 




There was one named Barabbas, who was in prison with rebels who had committed murder during the rebellion. 









###### 8 




The crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do for them as was his custom. 









###### 9 




Pilate answered them, "Do you want me to release the king of the Jews for you?" 









###### 10 




For he knew it was because of envy that the chief priests had handed him over. 









###### 11 




But the chief priests stirred up the crowd so that he would release Barabbas to them instead. 









###### 12 




Pilate asked them again, "Then what do you want me to do with the one you call the king of the Jews?" 









###### 13 




Again they shouted, "Crucify him!" 









###### 14 




Pilate said to them, "Why? What has he done wrong?" But they shouted all the more, "Crucify him!" 









###### 15 




Wanting to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them; and after having Jesus flogged, he handed him over to be crucified. ## Mocked by the Military 









###### 16 




The soldiers led him away into the palace (that is, the governor's residence) and called the whole company together. 









###### 17 




They dressed him in a purple robe, twisted together a crown of thorns, and put it on him. 









###### 18 




And they began to salute him, "Hail, king of the Jews!" 









###### 19 




They were hitting him on the head with a stick and spitting on him. Getting down on their knees, they were paying him homage. 









###### 20 




After they had mocked him, they stripped him of the purple robe and put his clothes on him. ## Crucified Between Two Criminals They led him out to crucify him. 









###### 21 




They forced a man coming in from the country, who was passing by, to carry Jesus's cross. He was Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus. 









###### 22 




They brought Jesus to the place called <em>Golgotha</em> (which means Place of the Skull). 









###### 23 




They tried to give him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it. 









###### 24 




Then they crucified him and divided his clothes, casting lots for them to decide what each would get. 









###### 25 




Now it was nine in the morning[^a] when they crucified him. 









###### 26 




The inscription of the charge written against him was: The King of the Jews. 









###### 27 




They crucified two criminals[^b] with him, one on his right and one on his left.[^c] 









###### 29 




Those who passed by were yelling insults at[^d] him, shaking their heads, and saying, "Ha! The one who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, 









###### 30 




save yourself by coming down from the cross!" 









###### 31 




In the same way, the chief priests with the scribes were mocking him among themselves and saying, "He saved others, but he cannot save himself! 









###### 32 




Let the Messiah, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, so that we may see and believe." Even those who were crucified with him taunted him. ## The Death of Jesus 









###### 33 




When it was noon,[^e] darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon.[^f] 









###### 34 




And at three Jesus cried out with a loud voice, <i class="transliteration">"Eloi, Eloi, lemá sabachtháni?"_ which is translated, "My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?"[^g] 









###### 35 




When some of those standing there heard this, they said, "See, he's calling for Elijah." 









###### 36 




Someone ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, fixed it on a stick, offered him a drink, and said, "Let's see if Elijah comes to take him down." 









###### 37 




Jesus let out a loud cry and breathed his last. 









###### 38 




Then the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. 









###### 39 




When the centurion, who was standing opposite him, saw the way he[^h] breathed his last, he said, "Truly this man was the Son of God!" [^i] 









###### 40 




There were also women watching from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome. 









###### 41 




In Galilee these women followed him and took care of him. Many other women had come up with him to Jerusalem. ## The Burial of Jesus 









###### 42 




When it was already evening, because it was the day of preparation (that is, the day before the Sabbath), 









###### 43 




Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the Sanhedrin who was himself looking forward to the kingdom of God, came and boldly went to Pilate and asked for Jesus's body. 









###### 44 




Pilate was surprised that he was already dead. Summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he had already died. 









###### 45 




When he found out from the centurion, he gave the corpse to Joseph. 









###### 46 




After he bought some linen cloth, Joseph took him down and wrapped him in the linen. Then he laid him in a tomb cut out of the rock and rolled a stone against the entrance to the tomb. 









###### 47 




Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses were watching where he was laid. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

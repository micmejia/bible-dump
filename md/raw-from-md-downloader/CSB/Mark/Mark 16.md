# Mark 16

***










###### 1 




When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices, so that they could go and anoint him. 









###### 2 




Very early in the morning, on the first day of the week, they went to the tomb at sunrise. 









###### 3 




They were saying to one another, "Who will roll away the stone from the entrance to the tomb for us?" 









###### 4 




Looking up, they noticed that the stone--which was very large--had been rolled away. 









###### 5 




When they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side; they were alarmed. 









###### 6 




"Don't be alarmed," he told them. "You are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen! He is not here. See the place where they put him. 









###### 7 




But go, tell his disciples and Peter, 'He is going ahead of you to Galilee; you will see him there just as he told you.'" 









###### 8 




They went out and ran from the tomb, because trembling and astonishment overwhelmed them. And they said nothing to anyone, since they were afraid. ## The Longer Ending of Mark: Appearances of the Risen Lord [ 









###### 9 




Early on the first day of the week, after he had risen, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had driven seven demons. 









###### 10 




She went and reported to those who had been with him, as they were mourning and weeping. 









###### 11 




Yet, when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, they did not believe it. 









###### 12 




After this, he appeared in a different form to two of them walking on their way into the country. 









###### 13 




And they went and reported it to the rest, who did not believe them either. ## The Great Commission 









###### 14 




Later he appeared to the Eleven themselves as they were reclining at the table. He rebuked their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who saw him after he had risen. 









###### 15 




Then he said to them, "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation. 









###### 16 




Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned. 









###### 17 




And these signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues;[^b] 









###### 18 




they will pick up snakes; [^c] if they should drink anything deadly, it will not harm them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will get well." ## The Ascension 









###### 19 




So the Lord Jesus, after speaking to them, was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God. 









###### 20 




And they went out and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the word by the accompanying signs.] ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

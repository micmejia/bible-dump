So all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations; and from David until the exile to Babylon, fourteen generations; and from the exile to Babylon until the Messiah, fourteen generations. ## The Nativity of the Messiah 









###### 18 




The birth of Jesus Christ came about this way: After his mother Mary had been engaged[^g] to Joseph, it was discovered before they came together that she was pregnant from the Holy Spirit. 









###### 19 




So her husband, Joseph, being a righteous man, and not wanting to disgrace her publicly, decided to divorce her secretly. 









###### 20 




But after he had considered these things, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, don't be afraid to take Mary as your wife, because what has been conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. 









###### 21 




She will give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins." 









###### 22 




Now all this took place to fulfill what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet: 









###### 23 




<b class="quote">See, the virgin will become pregnant** <b class="quote">and give birth to a son,** <b class="quote">and they will name him Immanuel**,[^h] which is translated "God is with us." 









###### 24 




When Joseph woke up, he did as the Lord's angel had commanded him. He married her 









###### 25 




but did not have sexual relations with her until she gave birth to a son.[^i] And he named him Jesus. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

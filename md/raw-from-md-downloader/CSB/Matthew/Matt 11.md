# Matthew 11

***










###### 1 




When Jesus had finished giving instructions to his twelve disciples, he moved on from there to teach and preach in their towns. 









###### 2 




Now when John heard in prison what the Christ was doing, he sent a message through his disciples 









###### 3 




and asked him, "Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?" 









###### 4 




Jesus replied to them, "Go and report to John what you hear and see: 









###### 5 




The blind receive their sight, the lame walk, those with leprosy[^a] are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor are told the good news, 









###### 6 




and blessed is the one who isn't offended by me." 









###### 7 




As these men were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swaying in the wind? 









###### 8 




What then did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothes? See, those who wear soft clothes are in royal palaces. 









###### 9 




What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. 









###### 10 




This is the one about whom it is written: <b class="quote">See, I am sending my messenger ahead of you;** <b class="quote">he will prepare your way before you.**[^b] 









###### 11 




"Truly I tell you, among those born of women no one greater than John the Baptist has appeared,[^c] but the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. 









###### 12 




From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been suffering violence,[^d] and the violent have been seizing it by force. 









###### 13 




For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John. 









###### 14 




And if you're willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who is to come. 









###### 15 




Let anyone who has ears[^e] listen. ## An Unresponsive Generation 









###### 16 




"To what should I compare this generation? It's like children sitting in the marketplaces who call out to other children: 









###### 17 




We played the flute for you, but you didn't dance; we sang a lament, but you didn't mourn![^f] 









###### 18 




For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon!' 









###### 19 




The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' Yet wisdom is vindicated[^g] by her deeds."[^h] 









###### 20 




Then he proceeded to denounce the towns where most of his miracles were done, because they did not repent: 









###### 21 




"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented in sackcloth and ashes long ago. 









###### 22 




But I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you. 









###### 23 




And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will go down to Hades. For if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until today. 









###### 24 




But I tell you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you." ## The Son Gives Knowledge and Rest 









###### 25 




At that time Jesus said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and revealed them to infants. 









###### 26 




Yes, Father, because this was your good pleasure.[^i] 









###### 27 




All things have been entrusted to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son desires[^j] to reveal him. 









###### 28 




"Come to me, all of you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. 









###### 29 




Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, because I am lowly and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. 









###### 30 




For my yoke is easy and my burden is light." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

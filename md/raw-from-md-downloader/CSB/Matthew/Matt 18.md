# Matthew 18

***










###### 1 




At that time[^a] the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "So who is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?" 









###### 2 




He called a small child and had him stand among them. 









###### 3 




"Truly I tell you," he said, "unless you turn and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. 









###### 4 




Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this child--this one is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. 









###### 5 




And whoever welcomes[^b] one child like this in my name welcomes me. 









###### 6 




"But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to fall away--it would be better for him if a heavy millstone were hung around his neck and he were drowned in the depths of the sea. 









###### 7 




Woe to the world because of offenses. For offenses will inevitably come, but woe to that person by whom the offense comes. 









###### 8 




If your hand or your foot causes you to fall away, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or lame than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into the eternal fire. 









###### 9 




And if your eye causes you to fall away, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hellfire.[^c] ## The Parable of the Lost Sheep 









###### 10 




"See to it that you don't despise one of these little ones, because I tell you that in heaven their angels continually view the face of my Father in heaven.[^d] 









###### 12 




What do you think? If someone has a hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, won't he leave the ninety-nine on the hillside and go and search for the stray? 









###### 13 




And if he finds it, truly I tell you, he rejoices over that sheep[^e] more than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray. 









###### 14 




In the same way, it is not the will of your Father in heaven that one of these little ones perish. ## Restoring a Brother 









###### 15 




"If your brother sins against you,[^f] go tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have won your brother. 









###### 16 




But if he won't listen, take one or two others with you, so that <b class="quote">by the testimony**[^g] <b class="quote">of two or three witnesses every fact may be established.**[^h] 









###### 17 




If he doesn't pay attention to them, tell the church.[^i] If he doesn't pay attention even to the church, let him be like a Gentile and a tax collector to you. 









###### 18 




Truly I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will have been bound[^j] in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will have been loosed[^k] in heaven. 









###### 19 




Again, truly I tell you, if two of you on earth agree about any matter that you[^l] pray for, it will be done for you[^m] by my Father in heaven. 









###### 20 




For where two or three are gathered together in my name, I am there among them." ## The Parable of the Unforgiving Servant 









###### 21 




Then Peter approached him and asked, "Lord, how many times must I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? As many as seven times?" 









###### 22 




"I tell you, not as many as seven," Jesus replied, "but seventy times seven.[^n] 









###### 23 




"For this reason, the kingdom of heaven can be compared to a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants. 









###### 24 




When he began to settle accounts, one who owed ten thousand talents[^o] was brought before him. 









###### 25 




Since he did not have the money to pay it back, his master commanded that he, his wife, his children, and everything he had be sold to pay the debt. 









###### 26 




"At this, the servant fell facedown before him and said, 'Be patient with me, and I will pay you everything.' 









###### 27 




Then the master of that servant had compassion, released him, and forgave him the loan. 









###### 28 




"That servant went out and found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii.[^p] He grabbed him, started choking him, and said, 'Pay what you owe!' 









###### 29 




"At this, his fellow servant fell down[^q] and began begging him, 'Be patient with me, and I will pay you back.' 









###### 30 




But he wasn't willing. Instead, he went and threw him into prison until he could pay what was owed. 









###### 31 




When the other servants saw what had taken place, they were deeply distressed and went and reported to their master everything that had happened. 









###### 32 




Then, after he had summoned him, his master said to him, 'You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you begged me. 









###### 33 




Shouldn't you also have had mercy on your fellow servant, as I had mercy on you?' 









###### 34 




And because he was angry, his master handed him over to the jailers to be tortured until he could pay everything that was owed. 









###### 35 




So also my heavenly Father will do to you unless every one of you forgives his brother or sister[^r] from your heart." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

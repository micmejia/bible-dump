# Matthew 2

***










###### 1 




After Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of King Herod, wise men from the east arrived in Jerusalem, 









###### 2 




saying, "Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we saw his star at its rising and have come to worship him."[^a] 









###### 3 




When King Herod heard this, he was deeply disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him. 









###### 4 




So he assembled all the chief priests and scribes of the people and asked them where the Messiah would be born. 









###### 5 




"In Bethlehem of Judea," they told him, "because this is what was written by the prophet: 









###### 6 




<b class="quote">And you, Bethlehem,** in the land of Judah, are by no means <b class="quote">least among the rulers of Judah:** <b class="quote">Because out of you will come a ruler** <b class="quote">who will shepherd my people Israel.**"[^b] 









###### 7 




Then Herod secretly summoned the wise men and asked them the exact time the star appeared. 









###### 8 




He sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and search carefully for the child. When you find him, report back to me so that I too can go and worship him."[^c] 









###### 9 




After hearing the king, they went on their way. And there it was--the star they had seen at its rising. It led them until it came and stopped above the place where the child was. 









###### 10 




When they saw the star, they were overwhelmed with joy. 









###### 11 




Entering the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and falling to their knees, they worshiped him.[^d] Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh. 









###### 12 




And being warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their own country by another route. ## The Flight into Egypt 









###### 13 




After they were gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, "Get up! Take the child and his mother, flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you. For Herod is about to search for the child to kill him." 









###### 14 




So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night, and escaped to Egypt. 









###### 15 




He stayed there until Herod's death, so that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled: <b class="quote">Out of Egypt I called my Son.**[^e] ## The Massacre of the Innocents 









###### 16 




Then Herod, when he realized that he had been outwitted by the wise men, flew into a rage. He gave orders to massacre all the boys in and around Bethlehem who were two years old and under, in keeping with the time he had learned from the wise men. 









###### 17 




Then what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: 









###### 18 




<b class="quote">A voice was heard in Ramah,** <b class="quote">weeping,**[^f] <b class="quote">and great mourning,** <b class="quote">Rachel weeping for her children;** <b class="quote">and she refused to be consoled,** <b class="quote">because they are no more.**[^g] ## The Return to Nazareth 









###### 19 




After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, 









###### 20 




saying, "Get up, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, because those who intended to kill the child are dead." 









###### 21 




So he got up, took the child and his mother, and entered the land of Israel. 









###### 22 




But when he heard that Archelaus was ruling over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the region of Galilee. 









###### 23 




Then he went and settled in a town called Nazareth to fulfill what was spoken through the prophets, that he would be called a Nazarene. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

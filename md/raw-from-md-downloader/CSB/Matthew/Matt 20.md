# Matthew 20

***










###### 1 




"For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard. 









###### 2 




After agreeing with the workers on one denarius,[^a] he sent them into his vineyard for the day. 









###### 3 




When he went out about nine in the morning,[^b] he saw others standing in the marketplace doing nothing. 









###### 4 




He said to them, 'You also go into my vineyard, and I'll give you whatever is right.' So off they went. 









###### 5 




About noon and about three,[^c] he went out again and did the same thing. 









###### 6 




Then about five[^d] he went and found others standing around[^e] and said to them, 'Why have you been standing here all day doing nothing?' 









###### 7 




"'Because no one hired us,' they said to him. "'You also go into my vineyard,' he told them.[^f] 









###### 8 




When evening came, the owner of the vineyard told his foreman, 'Call the workers and give them their pay, starting with the last and ending with the first.' 









###### 9 




"When those who were hired about five came, they each received one denarius. 









###### 10 




So when the first ones came, they assumed they would get more, but they also received a denarius each. 









###### 11 




When they received it, they began to complain to the landowner: 









###### 12 




'These last men put in one hour, and you made them equal to us who bore the burden of the day's work and the burning heat.' 









###### 13 




"He replied to one of them, 'Friend, I'm doing you no wrong. Didn't you agree with me on a denarius? 









###### 14 




Take what's yours and go. I want to give this last man the same as I gave you. 









###### 15 




Don't I have the right to do what I want with what is mine? Are you jealous[^g] because I'm generous?'[^h] 









###### 16 




"So the last will be first, and the first last."[^i] ## The Third Prediction of His Death 









###### 17 




While going up to Jerusalem, Jesus took the twelve disciples aside privately and said to them on the way, 









###### 18 




"See, we are going up to Jerusalem. The Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death. 









###### 19 




They will hand him over to the Gentiles to be mocked, flogged,[^j] and crucified, and on the third day he will be raised."[^k] ## Suffering and Service 









###### 20 




Then the mother of Zebedee's sons approached him with her sons. She knelt down to ask him for something. 









###### 21 




"What do you want?" he asked her. "Promise,"[^l] she said to him, "that these two sons of mine may sit, one on your right and the other on your left, in your kingdom." 









###### 22 




Jesus answered, "You don't know what you're asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?"[^m] "We are able," they said to him. 









###### 23 




He told them, "You will indeed drink my cup,[^n] but to sit at my right and left is not mine to give; instead, it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father." 









###### 24 




When the ten disciples heard this, they became indignant with the two brothers. 









###### 25 




Jesus called them over and said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those in high positions act as tyrants over them. 









###### 26 




It must not be like that among you. On the contrary, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, 









###### 27 




and whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave; 









###### 28 




just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." ## Two Blind Men Healed 









###### 29 




As they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed him. 









###### 30 




There were two blind men sitting by the road. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, "Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!" 









###### 31 




The crowd demanded that they keep quiet, but they cried out all the more, "Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!" 









###### 32 




Jesus stopped, called them, and said, "What do you want me to do for you?" 









###### 33 




"Lord," they said to him, "open our eyes." 









###### 34 




Moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes. Immediately they could see, and they followed him. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

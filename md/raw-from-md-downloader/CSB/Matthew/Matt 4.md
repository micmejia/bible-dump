# Matthew 4

***










###### 1 




Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. 









###### 2 




After he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was hungry. 









###### 3 




Then the tempter approached him and said, "If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread." 









###### 4 




He answered, "It is written: <b class="quote">Man must not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.**"[^a] 









###### 5 




Then the devil took him to the holy city, had him stand on the pinnacle of the temple, 









###### 6 




and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down. For it is written: <b class="quote">He will give his angels** <b class="quote">orders concerning you**, and <b class="quote">they will support you with their hands** <b class="quote">so that you will not strike** <b class="quote">your foot against a stone.**"[^b] 









###### 7 




Jesus told him, "It is also written: <b class="quote">Do not test the Lord your God.**"[^c] 









###### 8 




Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor. 









###### 9 




And he said to him, "I will give you all these things if you will fall down and worship me."[^d] 









###### 10 




Then Jesus told him, "Go away,[^e] Satan! For it is written: <b class="quote">Worship the Lord your God, and serve only him.**"[^f] 









###### 11 




Then the devil left him, and angels came and began to serve him. ## Ministry in Galilee 









###### 12 




When he heard that John had been arrested, he withdrew into Galilee. 









###### 13 




He left Nazareth and went to live in Capernaum by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali. 









###### 14 




This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: 









###### 15 




<b class="quote">Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali,** <b class="quote">along the road by the sea, beyond the Jordan,** <b class="quote">Galilee of the Gentiles.** 









###### 16 




<b class="quote">The people who live in darkness** <b class="quote">have seen a great light,** <b class="quote">and for those living in the land of the shadow of death,** <b class="quote">a light has dawned.**[^g][^h] 









###### 17 




From then on Jesus began to preach, "Repent, because the kingdom of heaven has come near." ## The First Disciples 









###### 18 




As he was walking along the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon (who is called Peter), and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the sea--for they were fishermen. 









###### 19 




"Follow me," he told them, "and I will make you fish for[^i] people." 









###### 20 




Immediately they left their nets and followed him. 









###### 21 




Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat with Zebedee their father, preparing their nets, and he called them. 









###### 22 




Immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him. ## Teaching, Preaching, and Healing 









###### 23 




Now Jesus began to go all over Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing every[^j] disease and sickness[^k] among the people. 









###### 24 




Then the news about him spread throughout Syria. So they brought to him all those who were afflicted, those suffering from various diseases and intense pains, the demon-possessed, the epileptics, and the paralytics. And he healed them. 









###### 25 




Large crowds followed him from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and beyond the Jordan. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

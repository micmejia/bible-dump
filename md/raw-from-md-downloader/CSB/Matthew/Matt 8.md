# Matthew 8

***










###### 1 




When he came down from the mountain, large crowds followed him. 









###### 2 




Right away a man with leprosy[^a] came up and knelt before him, saying, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean." 









###### 3 




Reaching out his hand, Jesus touched him, saying, "I am willing; be made clean." Immediately his leprosy was cleansed. 









###### 4 




Then Jesus told him, "See that you don't tell anyone; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." ## A Centurion's Faith 









###### 5 




When he entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, pleading with him, 









###### 6 




"Lord, my servant is lying at home paralyzed, in terrible agony." 









###### 7 




He said to him, "Am I to come and heal him?"[^b] 









###### 8 




"Lord," the centurion replied, "I am not worthy to have you come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed. 









###### 9 




For I too am a man under authority, having soldiers under my command.[^c] I say to this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and to another, 'Come,' and he comes; and to my servant, 'Do this!' and he does it." 









###### 10 




Hearing this, Jesus was amazed and said to those following him, "Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with so great a faith. 









###### 11 




I tell you that many will come from east and west to share the banquet[^d] with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. 









###### 12 




But the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth." 









###### 13 




Then Jesus told the centurion, "Go. As you have believed, let it be done for you." And his servant was healed that very moment.[^e] ## Healings at Capernaum 









###### 14 




Jesus went into Peter's house and saw his mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever. 









###### 15 




So he touched her hand, and the fever left her. Then she got up and began to serve him. 









###### 16 




When evening came, they brought to him many who were demon-possessed. He drove out the spirits with a word and healed all who were sick, 









###### 17 




so that what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled: <b class="quote">He himself took our weaknesses** <b class="quote">and carried our diseases.**[^f] ## The Cost of Following Jesus 









###### 18 




When Jesus saw a large crowd[^g] around him, he gave the order to go to the other side of the sea. 









###### 19 




A scribe approached him and said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go." 









###### 20 




Jesus told him, "Foxes have dens, and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head." 









###### 21 




"Lord," another of his disciples said, "first let me go bury my father." 









###### 22 




But Jesus told him, "Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead." ## Wind and Waves Obey Jesus 









###### 23 




As he got into the boat, his disciples followed him. 









###### 24 




Suddenly, a violent storm arose on the sea, so that the boat was being swamped by the waves--but Jesus kept sleeping. 









###### 25 




So the disciples came and woke him up, saying, "Lord, save us! We're going to die!" 









###### 26 




He said to them, "Why are you afraid, you of little faith?" Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm. 









###### 27 




The men were amazed and asked, "What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the sea obey him!" ## Demons Driven Out by Jesus 









###### 28 




When he had come to the other side, to the region of the Gadarenes,[^h] two demon-possessed men met him as they came out of the tombs. They were so violent that no one could pass that way. 









###### 29 




Suddenly they shouted, "What do you have to do with us,[^i] Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?" 









###### 30 




A long way off from them, a large herd of pigs was feeding. 









###### 31 




"If you drive us out," the demons begged him, "send us into the herd of pigs." 









###### 32 




"Go!" he told them. So when they had come out, they entered the pigs, and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and perished in the water. 









###### 33 




Then the men who tended them fled. They went into the city and reported everything, especially what had happened to those who were demon-possessed. 









###### 34 




At that, the whole town went out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they begged him to leave their region. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Micah 2

***










###### 1 




Woe to those who dream up wickedness and prepare evil plans on their beds! At morning light they accomplish it because the power is in their hands. 









###### 2 




They covet fields and seize them; they also take houses. They deprive a man of his home, a person of his inheritance. 









###### 3 




Therefore, the Lord says: I am now planning a disaster against this nation; you cannot free your necks from it. Then you will not walk so proudly because it will be an evil time. 









###### 4 




In that day one will take up a taunt against you and lament mournfully, saying, "We are totally ruined! He measures out the allotted land of my people. How he removes it from me! He allots our fields to traitors." 









###### 5 




Therefore, there will be no one in the assembly of the Lord to divide the land by casting lots.[^a] ## God's Word Rejected 









###### 6 




"Quit your preaching," they[^b] preach. "They should not preach these things; shame will not overtake us."[^c] 









###### 7 




House of Jacob, should it be asked, "Is the Spirit of the Lord impatient? Are these the things he does?" Don't my words bring good to the one who walks uprightly? 









###### 8 




But recently my people have risen up like an enemy: You strip off the splendid robe from those who are passing through confidently, like those returning from war. 









###### 9 




You force the women of my people out of their comfortable homes, and you take my blessing[^d] from their children forever. 









###### 10 




Get up and leave, for this is not your place of rest because defilement brings destruction-- a grievous destruction! 









###### 11 




If a man comes and utters empty lies-- "I will preach to you about wine and beer"-- he would be just the preacher for this people! ## The Remnant Regathered 









###### 12 




I will indeed gather all of you, Jacob; I will collect the remnant of Israel. I will bring them together like sheep in a pen, like a flock in the middle of its pasture. It will be noisy with people. 









###### 13 




One who breaks open the way will advance before them; they will break out, pass through the city gate, and leave by it. Their King will pass through before them, the Lord as their leader. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

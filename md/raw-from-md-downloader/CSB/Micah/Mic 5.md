# Micah 5

***










###### 1 




Now, daughter who is under attack, you slash yourself in grief; a siege is set against us! They are striking the judge of Israel on the cheek with a rod. 









###### 2 




Bethlehem Ephrathah, you are small among the clans of Judah; one will come from you to be ruler over Israel for me. His origin[^a] is from antiquity, from ancient times. 









###### 3 




Therefore, Israel will be abandoned until the time when she who is in labor has given birth; then the rest of the ruler's brothers will return to the people of Israel. 









###### 4 




He will stand and shepherd them in the strength of the Lord, in the majestic name of the Lord his God. They will live securely, for then his greatness will extend to the ends of the earth. 









###### 5 




He will be their peace. When Assyria invades our land, when it marches against our fortresses, we will raise against it seven shepherds, even eight leaders of men. 









###### 6 




They will shepherd the land of Assyria with the sword, the land of Nimrod with a drawn blade.[^b] So he will rescue us from Assyria when it invades our land, when it marches against our territory. ## The Glorious and Purified Remnant 









###### 7 




Then the remnant of Jacob will be among many peoples like dew from the Lord, like showers on the grass, which do not wait for anyone or linger for mankind. 









###### 8 




Then the remnant of Jacob will be among the nations, among many peoples, like a lion among animals of the forest, like a young lion among flocks of sheep, which tramples and tears as it passes through, and there is no one to rescue them. 









###### 9 




Your hand will be lifted up against your adversaries, and all your enemies will be destroyed. 









###### 10 




In that day-- this is the Lord's declaration-- I will remove your horses from you and wreck your chariots. 









###### 11 




I will remove the cities of your land and tear down all your fortresses. 









###### 12 




I will remove sorceries from your hands, and you will not have any more fortune-tellers. 









###### 13 




I will remove your carved images and sacred pillars from you so that you will no longer worship the work of your hands. 









###### 14 




I will pull up the Asherah poles from among you and demolish your cities.[^c] 









###### 15 




I will take vengeance in anger and wrath against the nations that have not obeyed me. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

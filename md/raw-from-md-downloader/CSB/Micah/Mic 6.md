# Micah 6

***










###### 1 




Now listen to what the Lord is saying: Rise, plead your case before the mountains, and let the hills hear your complaint.[^a] 









###### 2 




Listen to the Lord's lawsuit, you mountains and enduring foundations of the earth, because the Lord has a case against his people, and he will argue it against Israel. 









###### 3 




My people, what have I done to you, or how have I wearied you? Testify against me! 









###### 4 




Indeed, I brought you up from the land of Egypt and redeemed you from that place of slavery. I sent Moses, Aaron, and Miriam ahead of you. 









###### 5 




My people, remember what King Balak of Moab proposed, what Balaam son of Beor answered him, and what happened from the Acacia Grove[^b] to Gilgal so that you may acknowledge the Lord's righteous acts. 









###### 6 




What should I bring before the Lord when I come to bow before God on high? Should I come before him with burnt offerings, with year-old calves? 









###### 7 




Would the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams or with ten thousand streams of oil? Should I give my firstborn for my transgression, the offspring of my body for my own sin? 









###### 8 




Mankind, he has told each of you what is good and what it is the Lord requires of you: to act justly, to love faithfulness, and to walk humbly with your God. ## Verdict of Judgment 









###### 9 




The voice of the Lord calls out to the city[^c] (and it is wise to fear your name): "Pay attention to the rod and the one who ordained it.[^d] 









###### 10 




Are there still[^e] the treasures of wickedness and the accursed short measure in the house of the wicked? 









###### 11 




Can I excuse wicked scales or bags of deceptive weights? 









###### 12 




For the wealthy of the city are full of violence, and its residents speak lies; the tongues in their mouths are deceitful. 









###### 13 




"As a result, I have begun to strike you severely,[^f] bringing desolation because of your sins. 









###### 14 




You will eat but not be satisfied, for there will be hunger within you. What you acquire, you cannot save, and what you do save, I will give to the sword.[^g] 









###### 15 




You will sow but not reap; you will press olives but not anoint yourself with oil; and you will tread grapes but not drink the wine. 









###### 16 




The statutes of Omri and all the practices of Ahab's house have been observed; you have followed their policies. Therefore, I will make you a desolate place and the city's[^h] residents an object of contempt;[^i] you will bear the scorn of my people."[^j] ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

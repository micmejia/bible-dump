# Nahum 1

***










###### 1 




The pronouncement concerning Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite. ## God's Vengeance 









###### 2 




The Lord is a jealous and avenging God; the Lord takes vengeance and is fierce in[^a] wrath. The Lord takes vengeance against his foes; he is furious with his enemies. 









###### 3 




The Lord is slow to anger but great in power; the Lord will never leave the guilty unpunished. His path is in the whirlwind and storm, and clouds are the dust beneath his feet. 









###### 4 




He rebukes the sea and dries it up, and he makes all the rivers run dry. Bashan and Carmel wither; even the flower of Lebanon withers. 









###### 5 




The mountains quake before him, and the hills melt; the earth trembles[^b][^c] at his presence-- the world and all who live in it. 









###### 6 




Who can withstand his indignation? Who can endure his burning anger? His wrath is poured out like fire; even rocks are shattered before him. ## Destruction of Nineveh 









###### 7 




The Lord is good, a stronghold in a day of distress; he cares for those who take refuge in him. 









###### 8 




But he will completely destroy Nineveh[^d] with an overwhelming flood, and he will chase his enemies into darkness. 









###### 9 




Whatever you[^e] plot against the Lord, he will bring it to complete destruction; oppression will not rise up a second time. 









###### 10 




For they will be consumed like entangled thorns, like the drink of a drunkard and like straw that is fully dry.[^f] 









###### 11 




One has gone out from you,[^g] who plots evil against the Lord, and is a wicked counselor. ## Promise of Judah's Deliverance 









###### 12 




This is what the Lord says: Though they are strong[^h] and numerous, they will still be mowed down, and he[^i] will pass away. Though I have punished you,[^j] I will punish you no longer. 









###### 13 




For I will now break off his yoke from you and tear off your shackles. ## The Assyrian King's Demise 









###### 14 




The Lord has issued an order concerning you: There will be no offspring to carry on your name.[^k] I will eliminate the carved idol and cast image from the house of your gods; I will prepare your grave, for you are contemptible. 









###### 15 




Look to the mountains-- the feet of the herald, who proclaims peace. Celebrate your festivals, Judah; fulfill your vows. For the wicked one will never again march through you; he will be entirely wiped out. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

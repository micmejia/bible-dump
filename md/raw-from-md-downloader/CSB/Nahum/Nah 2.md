# Nahum 2

***










###### 1 




One who scatters is coming up against you. Man the fortifications! Watch the road! Brace[^a] yourself! Summon all your strength! 









###### 2 




For the Lord will restore the majesty of Jacob, yes,[^b] the majesty of Israel, though ravagers have ravaged them and ruined their vine branches. 









###### 3 




The shields of his[^c] warriors are dyed red; the valiant men are dressed in scarlet. The fittings of the chariot flash like fire on the day of its battle preparations, and the spears are brandished. 









###### 4 




The chariots dash madly through the streets; they rush around in the plazas. They look like torches; they dart back and forth like lightning. 









###### 5 




He gives orders to his officers; they stumble as they advance. They race to its wall; the protective shield is set in place. 









###### 6 




The river gates are opened, and the palace erodes away. 









###### 7 




Beauty[^d] is stripped;[^e] she is carried away; her ladies-in-waiting moan like the sound of doves and beat their breasts. 









###### 8 




Nineveh has been like a pool of water from her first days,[^f] but they are fleeing. "Stop! Stop!" they cry, but no one turns back. 









###### 9 




"Plunder the silver! Plunder the gold!" There is no end to the treasure, an abundance of every precious thing. 









###### 10 




Desolation, decimation, devastation! Hearts melt, knees tremble, insides churn, every face grows pale! 









###### 11 




Where is the lions' lair, or the feeding ground of the young lions, where the lion and lioness prowled, and the lion's cub, with nothing to frighten them away? 









###### 12 




The lion mauled whatever its cubs needed and strangled prey for its lionesses. It filled up its dens with the kill, and its lairs with mauled prey. 









###### 13 




Beware, I am against you. This is the declaration of the Lord of Armies. I will make your chariots go up in smoke,[^g] and the sword will devour your young lions. I will cut off your prey from the earth, and the sound of your messengers will never be heard again. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

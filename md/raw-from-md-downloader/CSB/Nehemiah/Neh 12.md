The Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah-- he and his relatives were in charge of the songs of praise.

In the days of Joiakim, the heads of the priestly families were 









###### 22 




In the days of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua, the heads of the families of the Levites and priests were recorded while Darius the Persian ruled. 









###### 23 




Levi's descendants, the family heads, were recorded in the Book of the Historical Events during the days of Johanan son of Eliashib. 









###### 24 




The heads of the Levites--Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua son of Kadmiel, along with their relatives opposite them--gave praise and thanks, division by division, as David the man of God had prescribed. 









###### 25 




This included Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, and Obadiah. Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub were gatekeepers who guarded the storerooms at the city gates. 









###### 26 




These served in the days of Joiakim son of Jeshua, son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor and Ezra the priest and scribe. ## Dedication of the Wall 









###### 27 




At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, they sent for the Levites wherever they lived and brought them to Jerusalem to celebrate the joyous dedication with thanksgiving and singing accompanied by cymbals, harps, and lyres. 









###### 28 




The singers gathered from the region around Jerusalem, from the settlements of the Netophathites, 









###### 29 




from Beth-gilgal, and from the fields of Geba and Azmaveth, for they had built settlements for themselves around Jerusalem. 









###### 30 




After the priests and Levites had purified themselves, they purified the people, the city gates, and the wall. 









###### 31 




Then I brought the leaders of Judah up on top of the wall, and I appointed two large processions that gave thanks. One went to the right on the wall, toward the Dung Gate. 









###### 32 




Hoshaiah and half the leaders of Judah followed, 









###### 33 




along with Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam, 









###### 34 




Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah, 









###### 35 




and some of the priests' sons with trumpets, and Zechariah son of Jonathan, son of Shemaiah, son of Mattaniah, son of Micaiah, son of Zaccur, son of Asaph followed 









###### 36 




as well as his relatives--Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani, with the musical instruments of David, the man of God. Ezra the scribe went in front of them. 









###### 37 




At the Fountain Gate they climbed the steps of the city of David on the ascent of the wall and went above the house of David to the Water Gate on the east. 









###### 38 




The second thanksgiving procession went to the left, and I followed it with half the people along the top of the wall, past the Tower of the Ovens to the Broad Wall, 









###### 39 




above the Ephraim Gate, and by the Old Gate, the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel, and the Tower of the Hundred, to the Sheep Gate. They stopped at the Gate of the Guard. 









###### 40 




The two thanksgiving processions stood in the house of God. So did I and half of the officials accompanying me, 









###### 41 




as well as the priests: Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets; 









###### 42 




and Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer. Then the singers sang, with Jezrahiah as the leader. 









###### 43 




On that day they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced because God had given them great joy. The women and children also celebrated, and Jerusalem's rejoicing was heard far away. ## Support of the Levites' Ministry 









###### 44 




On that same day men were placed in charge of the rooms that housed the supplies, contributions, firstfruits, and tenths. The legally required portions for the priests and Levites were gathered from the village fields, because Judah was grateful to the priests and Levites who were serving. 









###### 45 




They performed the service of their God and the service of purification, along with the singers and gatekeepers, as David and his son Solomon had prescribed. 









###### 46 




For long ago, in the days of David and Asaph, there were heads[^c] of the singers and songs of praise and thanksgiving to God. 









###### 47 




So in the days of Zerubbabel and Nehemiah, all Israel contributed the daily portions for the singers and gatekeepers. They also set aside daily portions for the Levites, and the Levites set aside daily portions for Aaron's descendants. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

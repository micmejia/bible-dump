# Nehemiah 6

***










###### 1 




When Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and the rest of our enemies heard that I had rebuilt the wall and that no gap was left in it--though at that time I had not installed the doors in the city gates-- 









###### 2 




Sanballat and Geshem sent me a message: "Come, let's meet together in the villages of[^a] the Ono Valley." They were planning to harm me. 









###### 3 




So I sent messengers to them, saying, "I am doing important work and cannot come down. Why should the work cease while I leave it and go down to you?" 









###### 4 




Four times they sent me the same proposal, and I gave them the same reply. 









###### 5 




Sanballat sent me this same message a fifth time by his aide, who had an open letter in his hand. 









###### 6 




In it was written: It is reported among the nations--and Geshem[^b] agrees--that you and the Jews plan to rebel. This is the reason you are building the wall. According to these reports, you are to become their king 









###### 7 




and have even set up the prophets in Jerusalem to proclaim on your behalf, "There is a king in Judah." These rumors will be heard by the king. So come, let's confer together. 









###### 8 




Then I replied to him, "There is nothing to these rumors you are spreading; you are inventing them in your own mind." 









###### 9 




For they were all trying to intimidate us, saying, "They will drop their hands from[^c] the work, and it will never be finished." But now, my God, strengthen my hands. ## Attempts to Intimidate Nehemiah 









###### 10 




I went to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, son of Mehetabel, who was restricted to his house. He said: Let's meet at the house of God, inside the temple. Let's shut the temple doors because they're coming to kill you. They're coming to kill you tonight![^d] 









###### 11 




But I said, "Should a man like me run away? How can someone like me enter the temple and live? I will not go." 









###### 12 




I realized that God had not sent him, because of the prophecy he spoke against me. Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. 









###### 13 




He was hired, so that I would be intimidated, do as he suggested, sin, and get a bad reputation, in order that they could discredit me. 









###### 14 




My God, remember Tobiah and Sanballat for what they have done, and also the prophetess Noadiah and the other prophets who wanted to intimidate me. ## The Wall Completed 









###### 15 




The wall was completed in fifty-two days, on the twenty-fifth day of the month Elul. 









###### 16 




When all our enemies heard this, all the surrounding nations were intimidated and lost their confidence,[^e] for they realized that this task had been accomplished by our God. 









###### 17 




During those days, the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and Tobiah's letters came to them. 









###### 18 




For many in Judah were bound by oath to him, since he was a son-in-law of Shecaniah son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berechiah. 









###### 19 




These nobles kept mentioning Tobiah's good deeds to me, and they reported my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to intimidate me. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

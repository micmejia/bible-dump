# Numbers 17

***










###### 1 




The Lord instructed Moses, 









###### 2 




"Speak to the Israelites and take one staff from them for each ancestral tribe,[^a] twelve staffs from all the leaders of their tribes.[^b] Write each man's name on his staff. 









###### 3 




Write Aaron's name on Levi's staff, because there is to be one staff for the head of each tribe. 









###### 4 




Then place them in the tent of meeting in front of the testimony where I meet with you. 









###### 5 




The staff of the man I choose will sprout, and I will rid myself of the Israelites' complaints that they have been making about you." 









###### 6 




So Moses spoke to the Israelites, and each of their leaders gave him a staff, one for each of the leaders of their tribes, twelve staffs in all. Aaron's staff was among them. 









###### 7 




Moses placed the staffs before the Lord in the tent of the testimony. 









###### 8 




The next day Moses entered the tent of the testimony and saw that Aaron's staff, representing the house of Levi, had sprouted, formed buds, blossomed, and produced almonds! 









###### 9 




Moses then brought out all the staffs from the Lord's presence to all the Israelites. They saw them, and each man took his own staff. 









###### 10 




The Lord told Moses, "Put Aaron's staff back in front of the testimony to be kept as a sign for the rebels, so that you may put an end to their complaints before me, or else they will die." 









###### 11 




So Moses did as the Lord commanded him. 









###### 12 




Then the Israelites declared to Moses, "Look, we're perishing! We're lost; we're all lost! 









###### 13 




Anyone who comes near the Lord's tabernacle will die. Will we all perish?" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Numbers 23

***










###### 1 




Then Balaam said to Balak, "Build me seven altars here and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me." 









###### 2 




So Balak did as Balaam directed, and they offered a bull and a ram on each altar. 









###### 3 




Balaam said to Balak, "Stay here by your burnt offering while I am gone. Maybe the Lord will meet with me. I will tell you whatever he reveals to me." So he went to a barren hill. 









###### 4 




God met with him and Balaam said to him, "I have arranged seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar." 









###### 5 




Then the Lord put a message in Balaam's mouth and said, "Return to Balak and say what I tell you." 









###### 6 




So he returned to Balak, who was standing there by his burnt offering with all the officials of Moab. ## Balaam's First Oracle 









###### 7 




Balaam proclaimed his poem: Balak brought me from Aram; the king of Moab, from the eastern mountains: "Come, put a curse on Jacob for me; come, denounce Israel!" 









###### 8 




How can I curse someone God has not cursed? How can I denounce someone the Lord has not denounced? 









###### 9 




I see them from the top of rocky cliffs, and I watch them from the hills. There is a people living alone; it does not consider itself among the nations. 









###### 10 




Who has counted the dust of Jacob or numbered even one-fourth of Israel? Let me die the death of the upright; let the end of my life be like theirs. 









###### 11 




"What have you done to me?" Balak asked Balaam. "I brought you to curse my enemies, but look, you have only blessed them!" 









###### 12 




He answered, "Shouldn't I say exactly what the Lord puts in my mouth?" ## Balaam's Second Oracle 









###### 13 




Then Balak said to him, "Please come with me to another place where you can see them. You will only see the outskirts of their camp; you won't see all of them. From there, put a curse on them for me." 









###### 14 




So Balak took him to Lookout Field[^a] on top of Pisgah, built seven altars, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar. 









###### 15 




Balaam said to Balak, "Stay here by your burnt offering while I seek the Lord over there." 









###### 16 




The Lord met with Balaam and put a message in his mouth. Then he said, "Return to Balak and say what I tell you." 









###### 17 




So he returned to Balak, who was standing there by his burnt offering with the officials of Moab. Balak asked him, "What did the Lord say?" 









###### 18 




Balaam proclaimed his poem: Balak, get up and listen; son of Zippor, pay attention to what I say! 









###### 19 




God is not a man, that he might lie, or a son of man, that he might change his mind. Does he speak and not act, or promise and not fulfill? 









###### 20 




I have indeed received a command to bless; since he has blessed,[^b] I cannot change it. 









###### 21 




He considers no disaster for Jacob; he sees no trouble for Israel.[^c] The Lord their God is with them, and there is rejoicing over the King among them. 









###### 22 




God brought them out of Egypt; he is like the horns of a wild ox for them.[^d] 









###### 23 




There is no magic curse against Jacob and no divination against Israel. It will now be said about Jacob and Israel, "What great things God has done!" 









###### 24 




A people rise up like a lioness; they rouse themselves like a lion. They will not lie down until they devour the prey and drink the blood of the slain. 









###### 25 




Then Balak told Balaam, "Don't curse them and don't bless them!" 









###### 26 




But Balaam answered him, "Didn't I tell you: Whatever the Lord says, I must do?" ## Balaam's Third Oracle 









###### 27 




Again Balak said to Balaam, "Please come. I will take you to another place. Maybe it will be agreeable to God that you can put a curse on them for me there." 









###### 28 




So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, which overlooks the wasteland.[^e] 









###### 29 




Balaam told Balak, "Build me seven altars here and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me." 









###### 30 




So Balak did as Balaam said and offered a bull and a ram on each altar. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

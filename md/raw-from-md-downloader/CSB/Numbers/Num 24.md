# Numbers 24

***










###### 1 




Since Balaam saw that it pleased the Lord to bless Israel, he did not go to seek omens as on previous occasions, but turned[^a] toward the wilderness. 









###### 2 




When Balaam looked up and saw Israel encamped tribe by tribe, the Spirit of God came on him, 









###### 3 




and he proclaimed his poem: The oracle of Balaam son of Beor, the oracle of the man whose eyes are opened, 









###### 4 




the oracle of one who hears the sayings of God, who sees a vision from the Almighty, who falls into a trance with his eyes uncovered: 









###### 5 




How beautiful are your tents, Jacob, your dwellings, Israel. 









###### 6 




They stretch out like river valleys,[^b] like gardens beside a stream, like aloes the Lord has planted, like cedars beside the water. 









###### 7 




Water will flow from his buckets, and his seed will be by abundant water. His king will be greater than Agag, and his kingdom will be exalted. 









###### 8 




God brought him out of Egypt; he is like[^c] the horns of a wild ox for them. He will feed on enemy nations and gnaw their bones; he will strike them with his arrows. 









###### 9 




He crouches, he lies down like a lion or a lioness--who dares to rouse him? Those who bless you will be blessed, and those who curse you will be cursed. 









###### 10 




Then Balak became furious with Balaam, struck his hands together, and said to him, "I summoned you to put a curse on my enemies, but instead, you have blessed them these three times. 









###### 11 




Now go to your home! I said I would reward you richly, but look, the Lord has denied you a reward." 









###### 12 




Balaam answered Balak, "Didn't I previously tell the messengers you sent me: 









###### 13 




If Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go against the Lord's command, to do anything good or bad of my own will? I will say whatever the Lord says. 









###### 14 




Now I am going back to my people, but first, let me warn you what these people will do to your people in the future." ## Balaam's Fourth Oracle 









###### 15 




Then he proclaimed his poem: The oracle of Balaam son of Beor, the oracle of the man whose eyes are opened; 









###### 16 




the oracle of one who hears the sayings of God and has knowledge from the Most High, who sees a vision from the Almighty, who falls into a trance with his eyes uncovered: 









###### 17 




I see him, but not now; I perceive him, but not near. A star will come from Jacob, and a scepter will arise from Israel. He will smash the forehead[^d] of Moab and strike down[^e] all the Shethites.[^f] 









###### 18 




Edom will become a possession; Seir will become a possession of its enemies, but Israel will be triumphant. 









###### 19 




One who comes from Jacob will rule; he will destroy the city's survivors. 









###### 20 




Then Balaam saw Amalek and proclaimed his poem: Amalek was first among the nations, but his future is destruction. 









###### 21 




Next he saw the Kenites and proclaimed his poem: Your dwelling place is enduring; your nest is set in the cliffs. 









###### 22 




Kain will be destroyed when Asshur takes you captive. 









###### 23 




Once more he proclaimed his poem: Ah, who can live when God does this? 









###### 24 




Ships will come from the coast of Kittim; they will carry out raids against Asshur and Eber, but they too will come to destruction. 









###### 25 




Balaam then arose and went back to his homeland, and Balak also went his way. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

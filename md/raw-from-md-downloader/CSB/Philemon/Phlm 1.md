# Philemon 1

***










###### 1 




Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother: To Philemon our dear friend and coworker, 









###### 2 




to Apphia our sister,[^a] to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church that meets in your home. 









###### 3 




Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. ## Philemon's Love and Faith 









###### 4 




I always thank my God when I mention you in my prayers, 









###### 5 




because I hear of your love for all the saints and the faith that you have in the Lord Jesus. 









###### 6 




I pray that your participation in the faith may become effective through knowing every good thing that is in us[^b] for the glory of Christ. 









###### 7 




For I have great joy and encouragement from your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother. ## An Appeal for Onesimus 









###### 8 




For this reason, although I have great boldness in Christ to command you to do what is right, 









###### 9 




I appeal to you, instead, on the basis of love. I, Paul, as an elderly man[^c] and now also as a prisoner of Christ Jesus, 









###### 10 




appeal to you for my son, Onesimus.[^d] I became his father while I was in chains. 









###### 11 




Once he was useless to you, but now he is useful both to you and to me. 









###### 12 




I am sending him back to you--I am sending my very own heart.[^e][^f] 









###### 13 




I wanted to keep him with me, so that in my imprisonment for the gospel he might serve me in your place. 









###### 14 




But I didn't want to do anything without your consent, so that your good deed might not be out of obligation, but of your own free will. 









###### 15 




For perhaps this is why he was separated from you for a brief time, so that you might get him back permanently, 









###### 16 




no longer as a slave, but more than a slave--as a dearly loved brother. He is especially so to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord. 









###### 17 




So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would me. 









###### 18 




And if he has wronged you in any way, or owes you anything, charge that to my account. 









###### 19 




I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it--not to mention to you that you owe me even your very self. 









###### 20 




Yes, brother, may I benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ. 









###### 21 




Since I am confident of your obedience, I am writing to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say. 









###### 22 




Meanwhile, also prepare a guest room for me, since I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you. ## Final Greetings 









###### 23 




Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings, and so do 









###### 24 




Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my coworkers. 









###### 25 




The grace of the Lord[^g] Jesus Christ be with your spirit. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

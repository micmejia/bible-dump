# Philippians 4

***










###### 1 




So then, my dearly loved and longed for brothers and sisters, my joy and crown, in this manner stand firm in the Lord, dear friends. ## Practical Counsel 









###### 2 




I urge Euodia and I urge Syntyche to agree in the Lord. 









###### 3 




Yes, I also ask you, true partner,[^a] to help these women who have contended for the gospel at my side, along with Clement and the rest of my coworkers whose names are in the book of life. 









###### 4 




Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice! 









###### 5 




Let your graciousness[^b] be known to everyone. The Lord is near. 









###### 6 




Don't worry about anything, but in everything, through prayer and petition with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. 









###### 7 




And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus. 









###### 8 




Finally[^c] brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable--if there is any moral excellence and if there is anything praiseworthy--dwell on these things. 









###### 9 




Do what you have learned and received and heard from me, and seen in me, and the God of peace will be with you. ## Appreciation of Support 









###### 10 




I rejoiced in the Lord greatly because once again you renewed your care for me. You were, in fact, concerned about me but lacked the opportunity to show it. 









###### 11 




I don't say this out of need, for I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances I find myself. 









###### 12 




I know how to make do with little, and I know how to make do with a lot. In any and all circumstances I have learned the secret of being content--whether well fed or hungry, whether in abundance or in need. 









###### 13 




I am able to do all things through him[^d] who strengthens me. 









###### 14 




Still, you did well by partnering with me in my hardship. 









###### 15 




And you Philippians know that in the early days of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving except you alone. 









###### 16 




For even in Thessalonica you sent gifts for my need several times. 









###### 17 




Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the profit[^e] that is increasing to your account. 









###### 18 




But I have received everything in full, and I have an abundance. I am fully supplied,[^f] having received from Epaphroditus what you provided--a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God. 









###### 19 




And my God will supply all your needs according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus. 









###### 20 




Now to our God and Father be glory forever and ever. Amen. ## Final Greetings 









###### 21 




Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me send you greetings. 









###### 22 




All the saints send you greetings, especially those who belong to Caesar's household. 









###### 23 




The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.[^g] ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

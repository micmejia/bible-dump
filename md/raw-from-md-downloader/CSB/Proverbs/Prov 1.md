# Proverbs 1

***










###### 1 




The proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel: 









###### 2 




For learning wisdom and discipline; for understanding insightful sayings; 









###### 3 




for receiving prudent instruction in righteousness, justice, and integrity; 









###### 4 




for teaching shrewdness to the inexperienced,[^a] knowledge and discretion to a young man-- 









###### 5 




let a wise person listen and increase learning, and let a discerning person obtain guidance-- 









###### 6 




for understanding a proverb or a parable,[^b] the words of the wise, and their riddles. 









###### 7 




The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and discipline. ## Avoid the Path of the Violent 









###### 8 




Listen, my son, to your father's instruction, and don't reject your mother's teaching, 









###### 9 




for they will be a garland of favor on your head and pendants[^c] around your neck. 









###### 10 




My son, if sinners entice you, don't be persuaded. 









###### 11 




If they say--"Come with us! Let's set an ambush and kill someone.[^d] Let's attack some innocent person just for fun![^e] 









###### 12 




Let's swallow them alive, like Sheol, whole, like those who go down to the Pit. 









###### 13 




We'll find all kinds of valuable property and fill our houses with plunder. 









###### 14 




Throw in your lot with us, and we'll all share the loot"[^f]-- 









###### 15 




my son, don't travel that road with them or set foot on their path, 









###### 16 




because their feet run toward evil and they hurry to shed blood. 









###### 17 




It is useless to spread a net where any bird can see it, 









###### 18 




but they set an ambush to kill themselves;[^g] they attack their own lives. 









###### 19 




Such are the paths of all who make profit dishonestly; it takes the lives of those who receive it.[^h] ## Wisdom's Plea 









###### 20 




Wisdom calls out in the street; she makes her voice heard in the public squares. 









###### 21 




She cries out above[^i] the commotion; she speaks at the entrance of the city gates: 









###### 22 




"How long, inexperienced ones, will you love ignorance? How long will you mockers enjoy mocking and you fools hate knowledge? 









###### 23 




If you respond to my warning,[^j] then I will pour out my spirit on you and teach you my words. 









###### 24 




Since I called out and you refused, extended my hand and no one paid attention, 









###### 25 




since you neglected all my counsel and did not accept my correction, 









###### 26 




I, in turn, will laugh at your calamity. I will mock when terror strikes you, 









###### 27 




when terror strikes you like a storm and your calamity comes like a whirlwind, when trouble and stress overcome you. 









###### 28 




Then they will call me, but I won't answer; they will search for me, but won't find me. 









###### 29 




Because they hated knowledge, didn't choose to fear the Lord, 









###### 30 




were not interested in my counsel, and rejected all my correction, 









###### 31 




they will eat the fruit of their way and be glutted with their own schemes. 









###### 32 




For the apostasy of the inexperienced will kill them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them. 









###### 33 




But whoever listens to me will live securely and be undisturbed by the dread of danger." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

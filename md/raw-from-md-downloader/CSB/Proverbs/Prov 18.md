# Proverbs 18

***










###### 1 




One who isolates himself pursues selfish desires; he rebels against all sound wisdom.

###### 3 




When a wicked person comes, contempt also comes, and along with dishonor, derision. 









###### 4 




The words of a person's mouth are deep waters, a flowing river, a fountain of wisdom.[^b] 









###### 5 




It is not good to show partiality to the guilty, denying an innocent person justice. 









###### 6 




A fool's lips lead to strife, and his mouth provokes a beating. 









###### 7 




A fool's mouth is his devastation, and his lips are a trap for his life. 









###### 8 




A gossip's words are like choice food that goes down to one's innermost being.[^c] 









###### 9 




The one who is lazy in his work is brother to a vandal.[^d] 









###### 10 




The name of the Lord is a strong tower; the righteous run to it and are protected.[^e] 









###### 11 




The wealth of the rich is his fortified city; in his imagination it is like a high wall. 









###### 12 




Before his downfall a person's heart is proud, but humility comes before honor. 









###### 13 




The one who gives an answer before he listens-- this is foolishness and disgrace for him.

A person's gift opens doors[^f] for him and brings him before the great. 









###### 17 




The first to state his case seems right until another comes and cross-examines him. 









###### 18 




Casting the lot ends quarrels and separates powerful opponents. 









###### 19 




An offended brother is harder to reach[^g] than a fortified city, and quarrels are like the bars of a fortress. 









###### 20 




From the fruit of a person's mouth his stomach is satisfied; he is filled with the product of his lips. 









###### 21 




Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and those who love it will eat its fruit. 









###### 22 




A man who finds a wife finds a good thing and obtains favor from the Lord. 









###### 23 




The poor person pleads, but the rich one answers roughly. 









###### 24 




One with many friends may be harmed,[^h] but there is a friend who stays closer than a brother. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

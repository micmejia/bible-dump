# Proverbs 19

***










###### 1 




Better a poor person who lives with integrity than someone who has deceitful lips and is a fool. 









###### 2 




Even zeal is not good without knowledge, and the one who acts hastily[^a] sins. 









###### 3 




A person's own foolishness leads him astray, yet his heart rages against the Lord. 









###### 4 




Wealth attracts many friends, but a poor person is separated from his friend. 









###### 5 




A false witness will not go unpunished, and one who utters lies will not escape. 









###### 6 




Many seek a ruler's favor, and everyone is a friend of one who gives gifts. 









###### 7 




All the brothers of a poor person hate him; how much more do his friends keep their distance from him! He may pursue them with words, but they are not there.[^b] 









###### 8 




The one who acquires good sense[^c] loves himself; one who safeguards understanding finds success. 









###### 9 




A false witness will not go unpunished, and one who utters lies perishes. 









###### 10 




Luxury is not appropriate for a fool-- how much less for a slave to rule over princes! 









###### 11 




A person's insight gives him patience, and his virtue is to overlook an offense. 









###### 12 




A king's rage is like the roaring of a lion, but his favor is like dew on the grass. 









###### 13 




A foolish son is his father's ruin, and a wife's nagging is an endless dripping. 









###### 14 




A house and wealth are inherited from fathers, but a prudent wife is from the Lord. 









###### 15 




Laziness induces deep sleep, and a lazy person will go hungry. 









###### 16 




The one who keeps commands preserves himself; one who disregards[^d] his ways will die. 









###### 17 




Kindness to the poor is a loan to the Lord, and he will give a reward to the lender.[^e] 









###### 18 




Discipline your son while there is hope; don't set your heart on being the cause of his death.[^f] 









###### 19 




A person with intense anger bears the penalty; if you rescue him, you'll have to do it again. 









###### 20 




Listen to counsel and receive instruction so that you may be wise later in life.[^g] 









###### 21 




Many plans are in a person's heart, but the Lord's decree will prevail. 









###### 22 




What is desirable in a person is his fidelity; better to be a poor person than a liar. 









###### 23 




The fear of the Lord leads to life; one will sleep at night[^h] without danger. 









###### 24 




The slacker buries his hand in the bowl; he doesn't even bring it back to his mouth! 









###### 25 




Strike a mocker, and the inexperienced learn a lesson; rebuke the discerning, and he gains knowledge. 









###### 26 




The one who plunders his father and evicts his mother is a disgraceful and shameful son. 









###### 27 




If you stop listening to correction, my son, you will stray from the words of knowledge. 









###### 28 




A worthless witness mocks justice, and a wicked mouth swallows iniquity. 









###### 29 




Judgments are prepared for mockers, and beatings for the backs of fools. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

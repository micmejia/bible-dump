# Proverbs 2

***










###### 1 




My son, if you accept my words and store up my commands within you, 









###### 2 




listening closely[^a] to wisdom and directing your heart to understanding; 









###### 3 




furthermore, if you call out to insight and lift your voice to understanding, 









###### 4 




if you seek it like silver and search for it like hidden treasure, 









###### 5 




then you will understand the fear of the Lord and discover the knowledge of God. 









###### 6 




For the Lord gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding. 









###### 7 




He stores up success[^b] for the upright; He is a shield for those who live with integrity 









###### 8 




so that he may guard the paths of justice and protect the way of his faithful followers. 









###### 9 




Then you will understand righteousness, justice, and integrity--every good path. 









###### 10 




For wisdom will enter your heart, and knowledge will delight you. 









###### 11 




Discretion will watch over you, and understanding will guard you. 









###### 12 




It will rescue you from the way of evil-- from anyone who says perverse things, 









###### 13 




from those who abandon the right paths to walk in ways of darkness, 









###### 14 




from those who enjoy doing evil and celebrate perversion, 









###### 15 




whose paths are crooked, and whose ways are devious. 









###### 16 




It will rescue you from a forbidden woman, from a wayward woman with her flattering talk, 









###### 17 




who abandons the companion of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God; 









###### 18 




for her house sinks down to death and her ways to the land of the departed spirits. 









###### 19 




None return who go to her; none reach the paths of life. 









###### 20 




So follow the way of the good, and keep to the paths of the righteous. 









###### 21 




For the upright will inhabit the land, and those of integrity will remain in it; 









###### 22 




but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the treacherous ripped out of it. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

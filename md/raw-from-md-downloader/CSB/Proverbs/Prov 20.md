# Proverbs 20

***










###### 1 




Wine is a mocker, beer is a brawler; whoever goes astray[^a] because of them is not wise. 









###### 2 




A king's terrible wrath is like the roaring of a lion; anyone who provokes him endangers himself. 









###### 3 




Honor belongs to the person who ends a dispute, but any fool can get himself into a quarrel. 









###### 4 




The slacker does not plow during planting season;[^b] at harvest time he looks,[^c] and there is nothing. 









###### 5 




Counsel in a person's heart is deep water; but a person of understanding draws it out. 









###### 6 




Many a person proclaims his own loyalty, but who can find a trustworthy person? 









###### 7 




A righteous person acts with integrity; his children who come after him will be happy. 









###### 8 




A king sitting on a throne to judge separates out all evil with his eyes. 









###### 9 




Who can say, "I have kept my heart pure; I am cleansed from my sin"? 









###### 10 




Differing weights and varying measures[^d]-- both are detestable to the Lord. 









###### 11 




Even a young man is known by his actions-- by whether his behavior is pure and upright. 









###### 12 




The hearing ear and the seeing eye-- the Lord made them both. 









###### 13 




Don't love sleep, or you will become poor; open your eyes, and you'll have enough to eat. 









###### 14 




"It's worthless, it's worthless!" the buyer says, but after he is on his way, he gloats. 









###### 15 




There is gold and a multitude of jewels, but knowledgeable lips are a rare treasure. 









###### 16 




Take his garment, for he has put up security for a stranger; get collateral if it is for foreigners. 









###### 17 




Food gained by fraud is sweet to a person, but afterward his mouth is full of gravel. 









###### 18 




Finalize plans with counsel, and wage war with sound guidance. 









###### 19 




The one who reveals secrets is a constant gossip; avoid someone with a big mouth. 









###### 20 




Whoever curses his father or mother-- his lamp will go out in deep darkness. 









###### 21 




An inheritance gained prematurely will not be blessed ultimately. 









###### 22 




Don't say, "I will avenge this evil!" Wait on the Lord, and he will rescue you. 









###### 23 




Differing weights[^e] are detestable to the Lord, and dishonest scales are unfair. 









###### 24 




Even a courageous person's steps are determined by the Lord, so how can anyone understand his own way? 









###### 25 




It is a trap for anyone to dedicate something rashly and later to reconsider his vows. 









###### 26 




A wise king separates out the wicked and drives the threshing wheel over them. 









###### 27 




The Lord's lamp sheds light on a person's life,[^f] searching the innermost parts.[^g] 









###### 28 




Loyalty and faithfulness guard a king; through loyalty he maintains his throne. 









###### 29 




The glory of young men is their strength, and the splendor of old men is gray hair. 









###### 30 




Lashes and wounds purge away evil, and beatings cleanse the innermost parts.[^h] ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Proverbs 21

***










###### 1 




A king's heart is like channeled water in the Lord's hand: He directs it wherever he chooses. 









###### 2 




All a person's ways seem right to him, but the Lord weighs hearts. 









###### 3 




Doing what is righteous and just is more acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice. 









###### 4 




The lamp that guides the wicked-- haughty eyes and an arrogant heart--is sin. 









###### 5 




The plans of the diligent certainly lead to profit, but anyone who is reckless certainly becomes poor. 









###### 6 




Making a fortune through a lying tongue is a vanishing mist,[^a] a pursuit of death.[^b][^c] 









###### 7 




The violence of the wicked sweeps them away because they refuse to act justly. 









###### 8 




A guilty one's conduct is crooked, but the behavior of the innocent is upright. 









###### 9 




Better to live on the corner of a roof than to share a house with a nagging wife. 









###### 10 




A wicked person desires evil; he has no consideration[^d] for his neighbor. 









###### 11 




When a mocker is punished, the inexperienced become wiser; when one teaches a wise man, he acquires knowledge. 









###### 12 




The Righteous One[^e] considers the house of the wicked; he brings the wicked to ruin. 









###### 13 




The one who shuts his ears to the cry of the poor will himself also call out and not be answered. 









###### 14 




A secret gift soothes anger, and a covert bribe, fierce rage. 









###### 15 




Justice executed is a joy to the righteous but a terror to evildoers. 









###### 16 




The person who strays from the way of prudence will come to rest in the assembly of the departed spirits. 









###### 17 




The one who loves pleasure will become poor; whoever loves wine and oil will not get rich. 









###### 18 




The wicked are a ransom for the righteous, and the treacherous, for[^f] the upright. 









###### 19 




Better to live in a wilderness than with a nagging and hot-tempered wife. 









###### 20 




Precious treasure and oil are in the dwelling of a wise person, but a fool consumes them.[^g] 









###### 21 




The one who pursues righteousness and faithful love will find life, righteousness, and honor. 









###### 22 




A wise person went up against a city of warriors and brought down its secure fortress. 









###### 23 




The one who guards his mouth and tongue keeps himself out of trouble. 









###### 24 




The arrogant and proud person, named "Mocker," acts with excessive arrogance. 









###### 25 




A slacker's craving will kill him because his hands refuse to work. 









###### 26 




He is filled with craving[^h] all day long, but the righteous give and don't hold back. 









###### 27 




The sacrifice of a wicked person is detestable-- how much more so when he brings it with ulterior motives! 









###### 28 




A lying witness will perish, but the one who listens will speak successfully. 









###### 29 




A wicked person puts on a bold face, but the upright one considers his way. 









###### 30 




No wisdom, no understanding, and no counsel will prevail against the Lord. 









###### 31 




A horse is prepared for the day of battle, but victory comes from the Lord. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

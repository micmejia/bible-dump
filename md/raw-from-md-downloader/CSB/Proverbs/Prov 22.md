# Proverbs 22

***










###### 1 




A good name is to be chosen over great wealth; favor is better than silver and gold. 









###### 2 




Rich and poor have this in common:[^a] the Lord makes them all. 









###### 3 




A sensible person sees danger and takes cover, but the inexperienced keep going and are punished. 









###### 4 




Humility, the fear of the Lord, results in wealth, honor, and life. 









###### 5 




There are thorns and snares on the way of the crooked; the one who guards himself stays far from them. 









###### 6 




Start a youth out on his way; even when he grows old he will not depart from it. 









###### 7 




The rich rule over the poor, and the borrower is a slave to the lender. 









###### 8 




The one who sows injustice will reap disaster, and the rod of his fury will be destroyed. 









###### 9 




A generous person[^b] will be blessed, for he shares his food with the poor. 









###### 10 




Drive out a mocker, and conflict goes too; then quarreling and dishonor will cease. 









###### 11 




The one who loves a pure heart and gracious lips--the king is his friend. 









###### 12 




The Lord's eyes keep watch over knowledge, but he overthrows the words of the treacherous. 









###### 13 




The slacker says, "There's a lion outside! I'll be killed in the public square!" 









###### 14 




The mouth of the forbidden woman is a deep pit; a man cursed by the Lord will fall into it. 









###### 15 




Foolishness is bound to the heart of a youth; a rod of discipline will separate it from him. 









###### 16 




Oppressing the poor to enrich oneself, and giving to the rich--both lead only to poverty. ## Words of the Wise 









###### 17 




Listen closely,[^c] pay attention to the words of the wise, and apply your mind to my knowledge. 









###### 18 




For it is pleasing if you keep them within you and if they are[^d] constantly on your lips. 









###### 19 




I have instructed you today--even you-- so that your confidence may be in the Lord. 









###### 20 




Haven't I written for you thirty sayings[^e] about counsel and knowledge, 









###### 21 




in order to teach you true and reliable words, so that you may give a dependable report[^f] to those who sent you? 









###### 22 




Don't rob a poor person because he is poor, and don't crush the oppressed at the city gate, 









###### 23 




for the Lord will champion their cause and will plunder those who plunder them. 









###### 24 




Don't make friends with an angry person,[^g] and don't be a companion of a hot-tempered one, 









###### 25 




or you will learn his ways and entangle yourself in a snare. 









###### 26 




Don't be one of those who enter agreements,[^h] who put up security for loans. 









###### 27 




If you have nothing with which to pay, even your bed will be taken from under you. 









###### 28 




Don't move an ancient boundary marker that your ancestors set up. 









###### 29 




Do you see a person skilled in his work? He will stand in the presence of kings. He will not stand in the presence of the unknown. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

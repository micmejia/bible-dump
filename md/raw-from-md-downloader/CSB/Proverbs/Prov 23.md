# Proverbs 23

***










###### 1 




When you sit down to dine with a ruler, consider carefully what[^a] is before you, 









###### 2 




and put a knife to your throat if you have a big[^b] appetite; 









###### 3 




don't desire his choice food, for that food is deceptive. 









###### 4 




Don't wear yourself out to get rich; because you know better, stop! 









###### 5 




As soon as your eyes fly to it, it disappears, for it makes wings for itself and flies like an eagle to the sky. 









###### 6 




Don't eat a stingy person's bread,[^c] and don't desire his choice food, 









###### 7 




for it's like someone calculating inwardly.[^d] "Eat and drink," he says to you, but his heart is not with you. 









###### 8 




You will vomit the little you've eaten and waste your pleasant words. 









###### 9 




Don't speak to[^e] a fool, for he will despise the insight of your words. 









###### 10 




Don't move an ancient boundary marker, and don't encroach on the fields of the fatherless, 









###### 11 




for their Redeemer is strong, and he will champion their cause against you. 









###### 12 




Apply yourself to discipline and listen to words of knowledge. 









###### 13 




Don't withhold discipline from a youth; if you punish him with a rod, he will not die. 









###### 14 




Punish him with a rod, and you will rescue his life from Sheol. 









###### 15 




My son, if your heart is wise, my heart will indeed rejoice. 









###### 16 




My innermost being will celebrate when your lips say what is right. 









###### 17 




Don't let your heart envy sinners; instead, always fear the Lord. 









###### 18 




For then you will have a future, and your hope will not be dashed. 









###### 19 




Listen, my son, and be wise; keep your mind on the right course. 









###### 20 




Don't associate with those who drink too much wine or with those who gorge themselves on meat. 









###### 21 




For the drunkard and the glutton will become poor, and grogginess will clothe them in rags. 









###### 22 




Listen to your father who gave you life, and don't despise your mother when[^f] she is old. 









###### 23 




Buy--and do not sell--truth, wisdom, instruction, and understanding. 









###### 24 




The father of a righteous son will rejoice greatly, and one who fathers a wise son will delight in him. 









###### 25 




Let your father and mother have joy, and let her who gave birth to you rejoice. 









###### 26 




My son, give me your heart, and let your eyes observe my ways. 









###### 27 




For a prostitute is a deep pit, and a wayward woman is a narrow well; 









###### 28 




indeed, she sets an ambush like a robber and increases the number of unfaithful people. 









###### 29 




Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has conflicts? Who has complaints? Who has wounds for no reason? Who has red eyes? 









###### 30 




Those who linger over wine; those who go looking for mixed wine. 









###### 31 




Don't gaze at wine because it is red, because it gleams in the cup and goes down smoothly. 









###### 32 




In the end it bites like a snake and stings like a viper. 









###### 33 




Your eyes will see strange things, and you will say absurd things.[^g] 









###### 34 




You'll be like someone sleeping out at sea or lying down on the top of a ship's mast. 









###### 35 




"They struck me, but[^h] I feel no pain! They beat me, but I didn't know it! When will I wake up? I'll look for another drink." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

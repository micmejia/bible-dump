# Proverbs 25

***










###### 1 




These too are proverbs of Solomon, which the men of King Hezekiah of Judah copied. 









###### 2 




It is the glory of God to conceal a matter and the glory of kings to investigate a matter. 









###### 3 




As the heavens are high and the earth is deep, so the hearts of kings cannot be investigated. 









###### 4 




Remove impurities from silver, and material will be produced[^a] for a silversmith.[^b] 









###### 5 




Remove the wicked from the king's presence, and his throne will be established in righteousness. 









###### 6 




Don't boast about yourself before the king, and don't stand in the place of the great; 









###### 7 




for it is better for him to say to you, "Come up here!" than to demote you in plain view of a noble.[^c] 









###### 8 




Don't take a matter to court hastily. Otherwise, what will you do afterward if your opponent[^d] humiliates you? 









###### 9 




Make your case with your opponent without revealing another's secret; 









###### 10 




otherwise, the one who hears will disgrace you, and you'll never live it down.[^e] 









###### 11 




A word spoken at the right time is like gold apples in silver settings. 









###### 12 




A wise correction to a receptive ear is like a gold ring or an ornament of gold. 









###### 13 




To those who send him, a trustworthy envoy is like the coolness of snow on a harvest day; he refreshes the life of his masters. 









###### 14 




The one who boasts about a gift that does not exist is like clouds and wind without rain. 









###### 15 




A ruler can be persuaded through patience, and a gentle tongue can break a bone. 









###### 16 




If you find honey, eat only what you need; otherwise, you'll get sick from it and vomit. 









###### 17 




Seldom set foot in your neighbor's house; otherwise, he'll get sick of you and hate you. 









###### 18 




A person giving false testimony against his neighbor is like a club, a sword, or a sharp arrow. 









###### 19 




Trusting an unreliable person in a difficult time is like a rotten tooth or a faltering foot. 









###### 20 




Singing songs to a troubled heart is like taking off clothing on a cold day or like pouring vinegar on soda.[^f] 









###### 21 




If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat, and if he is thirsty, give him water to drink, 









###### 22 




for you will heap burning coals on his head, and the Lord will reward you. 









###### 23 




The north wind produces rain, and a backbiting tongue, angry looks. 









###### 24 




Better to live on the corner of a roof than to share a house with a nagging wife. 









###### 25 




Good news from a distant land is like cold water to a parched throat.[^g] 









###### 26 




A righteous person who yields to the wicked is like a muddied spring or a polluted well. 









###### 27 




It is not good to eat too much honey or to seek glory after glory.[^h] 









###### 28 




A person who does not control his temper is like a city whose wall is broken down. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

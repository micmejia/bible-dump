# Proverbs 26

***










###### 1 




Like snow in summer and rain at harvest, honor is inappropriate for a fool. 









###### 2 




Like a flitting sparrow or a fluttering swallow, an undeserved curse goes nowhere. 









###### 3 




A whip for the horse, a bridle for the donkey, and a rod for the backs of fools. 









###### 4 




Don't answer a fool according to his foolishness or you'll be like him yourself. 









###### 5 




Answer a fool according to his foolishness or he'll become wise in his own eyes. 









###### 6 




The one who sends a message by a fool's hand cuts off his own feet and drinks violence. 









###### 7 




A proverb in the mouth of a fool is like lame legs that hang limp. 









###### 8 




Giving honor to a fool is like binding a stone in a sling. 









###### 9 




A proverb in the mouth of a fool is like a stick with thorns, brandished by[^a] the hand of a drunkard. 









###### 10 




The one who hires a fool or who hires those passing by is like an archer who wounds everyone indiscriminately. 









###### 11 




As a dog returns to its vomit, so also a fool repeats his foolishness. 









###### 12 




Do you see a person who is wise in his own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than for him. 









###### 13 




The slacker says, "There's a lion in the road-- a lion in the public square!" 









###### 14 




A door turns on its hinges, and a slacker, on his bed. 









###### 15 




The slacker buries his hand in the bowl; he is too weary to bring it to his mouth! 









###### 16 




In his own eyes, a slacker is wiser than seven who can answer sensibly. 









###### 17 




A person who is passing by and meddles in a quarrel that's not his is like one who grabs a dog by the ears. 









###### 18 




Like a madman who throws flaming darts and deadly arrows, 









###### 19 




so is the person who deceives his neighbor and says, "I was only joking!" 









###### 20 




Without wood, fire goes out; without a gossip, conflict dies down. 









###### 21 




As charcoal for embers and wood for fire, so is a quarrelsome person for kindling strife. 









###### 22 




A gossip's words are like choice food that goes down to one's innermost being.[^b] 









###### 23 




Smooth[^c] lips with an evil heart are like glaze on an earthen vessel. 









###### 24 




A hateful person disguises himself with his speech and harbors deceit within. 









###### 25 




When he speaks graciously, don't believe him, for there are seven detestable things in his heart. 









###### 26 




Though his hatred is concealed by deception, his evil will be revealed in the assembly. 









###### 27 




The one who digs a pit will fall into it, and whoever rolls a stone-- it will come back on him. 









###### 28 




A lying tongue hates those it crushes, and a flattering mouth causes ruin. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

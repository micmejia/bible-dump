# Proverbs 27

***










###### 1 




Don't boast about tomorrow, for you don't know what a day might bring. 









###### 2 




Let another praise you, and not your own mouth-- a stranger, and not your own lips. 









###### 3 




A stone is heavy, and sand a burden, but aggravation from a fool outweighs them both. 









###### 4 




Fury is cruel, and anger a flood, but who can withstand jealousy? 









###### 5 




Better an open reprimand than concealed love. 









###### 6 




The wounds of a friend are trustworthy, but the kisses of an enemy are excessive. 









###### 7 




A person who is full tramples on a honeycomb, but to a hungry person, any bitter thing is sweet. 









###### 8 




Anyone wandering from his home is like a bird wandering from its nest. 









###### 9 




Oil and incense bring joy to the heart, and the sweetness of a friend is better than self-counsel.[^a] 









###### 10 




Don't abandon your friend or your father's friend, and don't go to your brother's house in your time of calamity; better a neighbor nearby than a brother far away. 









###### 11 




Be wise, my son, and bring my heart joy, so that I can answer anyone who taunts me. 









###### 12 




A sensible person sees danger and takes cover; the inexperienced keep going and are punished. 









###### 13 




Take his garment, for he has put up security for a stranger; get collateral if it is for foreigners.[^b] 









###### 14 




If one blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the morning, it will be counted as a curse to him. 









###### 15 




An endless dripping on a rainy day and a nagging wife are alike; 









###### 16 




the one who controls her controls the wind and grasps oil with his right hand. 









###### 17 




Iron sharpens iron, and one person sharpens another.[^c] 









###### 18 




Whoever tends a fig tree will eat its fruit, and whoever looks after his master will be honored. 









###### 19 




As water reflects the face, so the heart reflects the person. 









###### 20 




Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied, and people's eyes are never satisfied. 









###### 21 




As a crucible refines silver, and a smelter refines gold, so a person should refine his praise. 









###### 22 




Though you grind a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with grain, you will not separate his foolishness from him. 









###### 23 




Know well the condition of your flock, and pay attention to your herds, 









###### 24 




for wealth is not forever; not even a crown lasts for all time. 









###### 25 




When hay is removed and new growth appears and the grain from the hills is gathered in, 









###### 26 




lambs will provide your clothing, and goats, the price of a field; 









###### 27 




there will be enough goat's milk for your food-- food for your household and nourishment for your female servants. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

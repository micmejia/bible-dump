# Proverbs 28

***










###### 1 




The wicked flee when no one is pursuing them, but the righteous are as bold as a lion. 









###### 2 




When a land is in rebellion, it has many rulers, but with a discerning and knowledgeable person, it endures. 









###### 3 




A destitute leader[^a] who oppresses the poor is like a driving rain that leaves no food. 









###### 4 




Those who reject the law praise the wicked, but those who keep the law pit themselves against them. 









###### 5 




The evil do not understand justice, but those who seek the Lord understand everything. 









###### 6 




Better the poor person who lives with integrity than the rich one who distorts right and wrong.[^b] 









###### 7 




A discerning son keeps the law, but a companion of gluttons humiliates his father. 









###### 8 




Whoever increases his wealth through excessive interest collects it for one who is kind to the poor. 









###### 9 




Anyone who turns his ear away from hearing the law-- even his prayer is detestable. 









###### 10 




The one who leads the upright into an evil way will fall into his own pit, but the blameless will inherit what is good. 









###### 11 




A rich person is wise in his own eyes, but a poor one who has discernment sees through him. 









###### 12 




When the righteous triumph, there is great rejoicing,[^c] but when the wicked come to power, people hide. 









###### 13 




The one who conceals his sins will not prosper, but whoever confesses and renounces them will find mercy. 









###### 14 




Happy is the one who is always reverent, but one who hardens his heart falls into trouble. 









###### 15 




A wicked ruler over a helpless people is like a roaring lion or a charging bear. 









###### 16 




A leader who lacks understanding is very oppressive, but one who hates dishonest profit prolongs his life. 









###### 17 




Someone burdened by bloodguilt[^d] will be a fugitive until death. Let no one help him. 









###### 18 




The one who lives with integrity will be helped, but one who distorts right and wrong[^e] will suddenly fall. 









###### 19 




The one who works his land will have plenty of food, but whoever chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty. 









###### 20 




A faithful person will have many blessings, but one in a hurry to get rich will not go unpunished. 









###### 21 




It is not good to show partiality-- yet even a courageous person may sin for a piece of bread. 









###### 22 




A greedy one[^f] is in a hurry for wealth; he doesn't know that poverty will come to him. 









###### 23 




One who rebukes a person will later find more favor than one who flatters with his tongue. 









###### 24 




The one who robs his father or mother and says, "That's no sin," is a companion to a person who destroys. 









###### 25 




A greedy person stirs up conflict, but whoever trusts in the Lord will prosper. 









###### 26 




The one who trusts in himself[^g] is a fool, but one who walks in wisdom will be safe. 









###### 27 




The one who gives to the poor will not be in need, but one who turns his eyes away[^h] will receive many curses. 









###### 28 




When the wicked come to power, people hide, but when they are destroyed, the righteous flourish. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Proverbs 3

***










###### 1 




My son, don't forget my teaching, but let your heart keep my commands; 









###### 2 




for they will bring you many days, a full life,[^a] and well-being. 









###### 3 




Never let loyalty and faithfulness leave you. Tie them around your neck; write them on the tablet of your heart. 









###### 4 




Then you will find favor and high regard with God and people. 









###### 5 




Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not rely on your own understanding; 









###### 6 




in all your ways know him, and he will make your paths straight. 









###### 7 




Don't be wise in your own eyes; fear the Lord and turn away from evil. 









###### 8 




This will be healing for your body[^b] and strengthening for your bones. 









###### 9 




Honor the Lord with your possessions and with the first produce of your entire harvest; 









###### 10 




then your barns will be completely filled, and your vats will overflow with new wine. 









###### 11 




Do not despise the Lord's instruction, my son, and do not loathe his discipline; 









###### 12 




for the Lord disciplines the one he loves, just as a father disciplines the son in whom he delights. ## Wisdom Brings Happiness 









###### 13 




Happy is a man who finds wisdom and who acquires understanding, 









###### 14 




for she is more profitable than silver, and her revenue is better than gold. 









###### 15 




She is more precious than jewels; nothing you desire can equal her. 









###### 16 




Long life[^c] is in her right hand; in her left, riches and honor. 









###### 17 




Her ways are pleasant, and all her paths, peaceful. 









###### 18 




She is a tree of life to those who embrace her, and those who hold on to her are happy. 









###### 19 




The Lord founded the earth by wisdom and established the heavens by understanding. 









###### 20 




By his knowledge the watery depths broke open, and the clouds dripped with dew. 









###### 21 




Maintain sound wisdom and discretion. My son, don't lose sight of them. 









###### 22 




They will be life for you[^d] and adornment[^e] for your neck. 









###### 23 




Then you will go safely on your way; your foot will not stumble. 









###### 24 




When you lie[^f] down, you will not be afraid; you will lie down, and your sleep will be pleasant. 









###### 25 




Don't fear sudden danger or the ruin of the wicked when it comes, 









###### 26 




for the Lord will be your confidence[^g] and will keep your foot from a snare. ## Treat Others Fairly 









###### 27 




When it is in your power,[^h] don't withhold good from the one to whom it belongs. 









###### 28 




Don't say to your neighbor, "Go away! Come back later. I'll give it tomorrow"--when it is there with you. 









###### 29 




Don't plan any harm against your neighbor, for he trusts you and lives near you. 









###### 30 




Don't accuse anyone without cause, when he has done you no harm. 









###### 31 




Don't envy a violent man or choose any of his ways; 









###### 32 




for the devious are detestable to the Lord, but he is a friend[^i] to the upright. 









###### 33 




The Lord's curse is on the household of the wicked, but he blesses the home of the righteous; 









###### 34 




He mocks those who mock but gives grace to the humble. 









###### 35 




The wise will inherit honor, but he holds up fools to dishonor.[^j] ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

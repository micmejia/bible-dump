# Proverbs 30

***










###### 1 




The words of Agur son of Jakeh. The pronouncement.[^a] The man's oration to Ithiel, to Ithiel and Ucal:[^b] 









###### 2 




I am more stupid than any other person,[^c] and I lack a human's ability to understand. 









###### 3 




I have not gained wisdom, and I have no knowledge of the Holy One. 









###### 4 




Who has gone up to heaven and come down? Who has gathered the wind in his hands? Who has bound up the waters in a cloak? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is his name, and what is the name of his son-- if you know? 









###### 5 




Every word of God is pure;[^d] he is a shield to those who take refuge in him. 









###### 6 




Don't add to his words, or he will rebuke you, and you will be proved a liar. 









###### 7 




Two things I ask of you; don't deny them to me before I die: 









###### 8 




Keep falsehood and deceitful words far from me. Give me neither poverty nor wealth; feed me with the food I need. 









###### 9 




Otherwise, I might have too much and deny you, saying, "Who is the Lord?" or I might have nothing and steal, profaning[^e] the name of my God. 









###### 10 




Don't slander a servant to his master or he will curse you, and you will become guilty. 









###### 11 




There is a generation that curses its father and does not bless its mother. 









###### 12 




There is a generation that is pure in its own eyes, yet is not washed from its filth. 









###### 13 




There is a generation--how haughty its eyes and pretentious its looks.[^f] 









###### 14 




There is a generation whose teeth are swords, whose fangs are knives, devouring the oppressed from the land and the needy from among mankind. 









###### 15 




The leech has two daughters: "Give, Give!" Three things are never satisfied; four never say, "Enough!": 









###### 16 




Sheol; a childless womb; earth, which is never satisfied with water; and fire, which never says, "Enough!" 









###### 17 




As for the eye that ridicules a father and despises obedience to a mother, may ravens of the valley pluck it out and young vultures eat it. 









###### 18 




Three things are too wondrous for me; four I can't understand: 









###### 19 




the way of an eagle in the sky, the way of a snake on a rock, the way of a ship at sea, and the way of a man with a young woman. 









###### 20 




This is the way of an adulteress: she eats and wipes her mouth and says, "I've done nothing wrong." 









###### 21 




The earth trembles under three things; it cannot bear up under four: 









###### 22 




a servant when he becomes king, a fool when he is stuffed with food, 









###### 23 




an unloved woman when she marries, and a servant girl when she ousts her queen. 









###### 24 




Four things on earth are small, yet they are extremely wise: 









###### 25 




ants are not a strong people, yet they store up their food in the summer; 









###### 26 




hyraxes are not a mighty people, yet they make their homes in the cliffs; 









###### 27 




locusts have no king, yet all of them march in ranks; 









###### 28 




a lizard[^g] can be caught in your hands, yet it lives in kings' palaces. 









###### 29 




Three things are stately in their stride; four are stately in their walk: 









###### 30 




a lion, which is mightiest among beasts and doesn't retreat before anything; 









###### 31 




a strutting rooster;[^h] a goat; and a king at the head of his army.[^i] 









###### 32 




If you have been foolish by exalting yourself or if you've been scheming, put your hand over your mouth. 









###### 33 




For the churning of milk produces butter, and twisting a nose draws blood, and stirring up anger produces strife. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Proverbs 31

***










###### 1 




The words of King Lemuel, a pronouncement[^a] that his mother taught him: 









###### 2 




What should I say, my son? What, son of my womb? What, son of my vows? 









###### 3 




Don't spend your energy on women or your efforts on those who destroy kings. 









###### 4 




It is not for kings, Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine or for rulers to desire beer. 









###### 5 




Otherwise, he will drink, forget what is decreed, and pervert justice for all the oppressed.[^b] 









###### 6 




Give beer to one who is dying and wine to one whose life is bitter. 









###### 7 




Let him drink so that he can forget his poverty and remember his trouble no more. 









###### 8 




Speak up[^c] for those who have no voice,[^d] for the justice of all who are dispossessed.[^e] 









###### 9 




Speak up, judge righteously, and defend the cause of the oppressed and needy. ## In Praise of a Wife of Noble Character 









###### 10 




Who can find a wife of noble character?[^f] She is far more precious than jewels.[^g] 









###### 11 




The heart of her husband trusts in her, and he will not lack anything good. 









###### 12 




She rewards him with good, not evil, all the days of her life. 









###### 13 




She selects wool and flax and works with willing hands. 









###### 14 




She is like the merchant ships, bringing her food from far away. 









###### 15 




She rises while it is still night and provides food for her household and portions[^h] for her female servants. 









###### 16 




She evaluates a field and buys it; she plants a vineyard with her earnings.[^i] 









###### 17 




She draws on her strength[^j] and reveals that her arms are strong. 









###### 18 




She sees that her profits are good, and her lamp never goes out at night. 









###### 19 




She extends her hands to the spinning staff, and her hands hold the spindle. 









###### 20 




Her hands reach[^k] out to the poor, and she extends her hands to the needy. 









###### 21 




She is not afraid for her household when it snows, for all in her household are doubly clothed.[^l] 









###### 22 




She makes her own bed coverings; her clothing is fine linen and purple. 









###### 23 




Her husband is known at the city gates, where he sits among the elders of the land. 









###### 24 




She makes and sells linen garments; she delivers belts[^m] to the merchants. 









###### 25 




Strength and honor are her clothing, and she can laugh at the time to come. 









###### 26 




Her mouth speaks wisdom, and loving instruction[^n] is on her tongue. 









###### 27 




She watches over the activities of her household and is never idle.[^o] 









###### 28 




Her children rise up and call her blessed; her husband also praises her: 









###### 29 




"Many women[^p] have done noble deeds, but you surpass them all!" 









###### 30 




Charm is deceptive and beauty is fleeting, but a woman who fears the Lord will be praised. 









###### 31 




Give her the reward of her labor,[^q] and let her works praise her at the city gates. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Proverbs 4

***










###### 1 




Listen, sons, to a father's discipline, and pay attention so that you may gain understanding, 









###### 2 




for I am giving you good instruction. Don't abandon my teaching. 









###### 3 




When I was a son with my father, tender and precious to my mother, 









###### 4 




he taught me and said, "Your heart must hold on to my words. Keep my commands and live. 









###### 5 




Get wisdom, get understanding; don't forget or turn away from the words from my mouth. 









###### 6 




Don't abandon wisdom, and she will watch over you; love her, and she will guard you. 









###### 7 




Wisdom is supreme--so get wisdom. And whatever else you get, get understanding. 









###### 8 




Cherish her, and she will exalt you; if you embrace her, she will honor you. 









###### 9 




She will place a garland of favor on your head; she will give you a crown of beauty." ## Two Ways of Life 









###### 10 




Listen, my son. Accept my words, and you will live many years. 









###### 11 




I am teaching you the way of wisdom; I am guiding you on straight paths. 









###### 12 




When you walk, your steps will not be hindered; when you run, you will not stumble. 









###### 13 




Hold on to instruction; don't let go. Guard it, for it is your life. 









###### 14 




Keep off the path of the wicked; don't proceed on the way of evil ones. 









###### 15 




Avoid it; don't travel on it. Turn away from it, and pass it by. 









###### 16 




For they can't sleep unless they have done what is evil; they are robbed of sleep unless they make someone stumble. 









###### 17 




They eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence. 









###### 18 




The path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, shining brighter and brighter until midday. 









###### 19 




But the way of the wicked is like the darkest gloom; they don't know what makes them stumble. ## The Straight Path 









###### 20 




My son, pay attention to my words; listen closely to my sayings. 









###### 21 




Don't lose sight of them; keep them within your heart. 









###### 22 




For they are life to those who find them, and health to one's whole body. 









###### 23 




Guard your heart above all else,[^a] for it is the source of life. 









###### 24 




Don't let your mouth speak dishonestly, and don't let your lips talk deviously. 









###### 25 




Let your eyes look forward; fix your gaze[^b] straight ahead. 









###### 26 




Carefully consider the path[^c] for your feet, and all your ways will be established. 









###### 27 




Don't turn to the right or to the left; keep your feet away from evil. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Proverbs 5

***










###### 1 




My son, pay attention to my wisdom; listen closely[^a] to my understanding 









###### 2 




so that you may maintain discretion and your lips safeguard knowledge. 









###### 3 




Though the lips of the forbidden woman drip honey and her words are[^b] smoother than oil, 









###### 4 




in the end she's as bitter as wormwood and as sharp as a double-edged sword. 









###### 5 




Her feet go down to death; her steps head straight for Sheol. 









###### 6 




She doesn't consider the path of life; she doesn't know that her ways are unstable. 









###### 7 




So now, sons, listen to me, and don't turn away from the words from my mouth. 









###### 8 




Keep your way far from her. Don't go near the door of her house. 









###### 9 




Otherwise, you will give up your vitality to others and your years to someone cruel; 









###### 10 




strangers will drain your resources, and your hard-earned pay will end up in a foreigner's house. 









###### 11 




At the end of your life, you will lament when your physical body has been consumed, 









###### 12 




and you will say, "How I hated discipline, and how my heart despised correction. 









###### 13 




I didn't obey my teachers or listen closely[^c] to my instructors. 









###### 14 




I am on the verge of complete ruin before the entire community." ## Enjoy Marriage 









###### 15 




Drink water from your own cistern, water flowing from your own well. 









###### 16 




Should your springs flow in the streets, streams in the public squares? 









###### 17 




They should be for you alone and not for you to share with strangers. 









###### 18 




Let your fountain be blessed, and take pleasure in the wife of your youth. 









###### 19 




A loving deer, a graceful doe[^d]-- let her breasts always satisfy you; be lost in her love forever. 









###### 20 




Why, my son, would you lose yourself with a forbidden woman or embrace a wayward woman? 









###### 21 




For a man's ways are before the Lord's eyes, and he considers all his paths. 









###### 22 




A wicked man's iniquities will trap him; he will become tangled in the ropes of his own sin. 









###### 23 




He will die because there is no discipline, and be lost because of his great stupidity. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Proverbs 7

***










###### 1 




My son, obey my words, and treasure my commands. 









###### 2 




Keep my commands and live, and guard my instructions as you would the pupil of your eye. 









###### 3 




Tie them to your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart. 









###### 4 




Say to wisdom, "You are my sister," and call understanding your relative. 









###### 5 




She will keep you from a forbidden woman, a wayward woman with her flattering talk. ## A Story of Seduction 









###### 6 




At the window of my house I looked through my lattice. 









###### 7 




I saw among the inexperienced,[^a] I noticed among the youths, a young man lacking sense. 









###### 8 




Crossing the street near her corner, he strolled down the road to her house 









###### 9 




at twilight, in the evening, in the dark of the night. 









###### 10 




A woman came to meet him dressed like a prostitute, having a hidden agenda.[^b] 









###### 11 




She is loud and defiant; her feet do not stay at home. 









###### 12 




Now in the street, now in the squares, she lurks at every corner. 









###### 13 




She grabs him and kisses him; she brazenly says[^c] to him, 









###### 14 




"I've made fellowship offerings; today I've fulfilled my vows. 









###### 15 




So I came out to meet you, to search for you, and I've found you. 









###### 16 




I've spread coverings on my bed-- richly colored linen from Egypt. 









###### 17 




I've perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 









###### 18 




Come, let's drink deeply of lovemaking until morning. Let's feast on each other's love! 









###### 19 




My husband isn't home; he went on a long journey. 









###### 20 




He took a bag of silver with him and will come home at the time of the full moon." 









###### 21 




She seduces him with her persistent pleading; she lures with her flattering talk. 









###### 22 




He follows her impulsively like an ox going to the slaughter, like a deer bounding toward a trap[^d] 









###### 23 




until an arrow pierces its[^e] liver, like a bird darting into a snare-- he doesn't know it will cost him his life. 









###### 24 




Now, sons, listen to me, and pay attention to the words from my mouth. 









###### 25 




Don't let your heart turn aside to her ways; don't stray onto her paths. 









###### 26 




For she has brought many down to death; her victims are countless.[^f] 









###### 27 




Her house is the road to Sheol, descending to the chambers of death. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

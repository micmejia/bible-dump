# Psalms 1

***










###### 1 




How happy is the one who does not walk in the advice of the wicked or stand in the pathway with sinners or sit in the company of mockers! 









###### 2 




Instead, his delight is in the Lord's instruction, and he meditates on it day and night. 









###### 3 




He is like a tree planted beside flowing streams[^a] that bears its fruit in its season, and its leaf does not wither. Whatever he does prospers. 









###### 4 




The wicked are not like this; instead, they are like chaff that the wind blows away. 









###### 5 




Therefore the wicked will not stand up in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous. 









###### 6 




For the Lord watches over the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked leads to ruin. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

Hallelujah! Give praise, servants of the Lord; praise the name of the Lord. 









###### 2 




Let the name of the Lord be blessed both now and forever. 









###### 3 




From the rising of the sun to its setting, let the name of the Lord be praised. 









###### 4 




The Lord is exalted above all the nations, his glory above the heavens. 









###### 5 




Who is like the Lord our God-- the one enthroned on high, 









###### 6 




who stoops down to look on the heavens and the earth? 









###### 7 




He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the trash heap 









###### 8 




in order to seat them with nobles-- with the nobles of his people.

He gives the childless woman a household, making her the joyful mother of children.

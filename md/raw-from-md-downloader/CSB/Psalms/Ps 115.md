# Psalms 115

***










###### 1 




Not to us, Lord, not to us, but to your name give glory because of your faithful love, because of your truth. 









###### 2 




Why should the nations say, "Where is their God?" 









###### 3 




Our God is in heaven and does whatever he pleases. 









###### 4 




Their idols are silver and gold, made by human hands. 









###### 5 




They have mouths but cannot speak, eyes, but cannot see. 









###### 6 




They have ears but cannot hear, noses, but cannot smell. 









###### 7 




They have hands but cannot feel, feet, but cannot walk. They cannot make a sound with their throats. 









###### 8 




Those who make them are[^a] just like them, as are all who trust in them. 









###### 9 




Israel,[^b] trust in the Lord! He is their help and shield. 









###### 10 




House of Aaron, trust in the Lord! He is their help and shield. 









###### 11 




You who fear the Lord, trust in the Lord! He is their help and shield. 









###### 12 




The Lord remembers us and will bless us. He will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron; 









###### 13 




he will bless those who fear the Lord-- small and great alike. 









###### 14 




May the Lord add to your numbers, both yours and your children's. 









###### 15 




May you be blessed by the Lord, the Maker of heaven and earth. 









###### 16 




The heavens are the Lord's,[^c] but the earth he has given to the human race. 









###### 17 




It is not the dead who praise the Lord, nor any of those descending into the silence of death. 









###### 18 




But we will bless the Lord, both now and forever.

# Psalms 120

***










###### 1 




In my distress I called to the Lord, and he answered me. 









###### 2 




"Lord, rescue me from lying lips and a deceitful tongue." 









###### 3 




What will he give you, and what will he do to you, you deceitful tongue? 









###### 4 




A warrior's sharp arrows with burning charcoal![^a] 









###### 5 




What misery that I have stayed in Meshech,[^b] that I have lived among the tents of Kedar![^c] 









###### 6 




I have dwelt too long with those who hate peace. 









###### 7 




I am for peace; but when I speak, they are for war. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

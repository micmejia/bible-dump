# Psalms 122

***










###### 1 




I rejoiced with those who said to me, "Let's go to the house of the Lord." 









###### 2 




Our feet were standing within your gates, Jerusalem-- 









###### 3 




Jerusalem, built as a city should be, solidly united, 









###### 4 




where the tribes, the Lord's tribes, go up to give thanks to the name of the Lord. (This is an ordinance for Israel.) 









###### 5 




There, thrones for judgment are placed, thrones of the house of David. 









###### 6 




Pray for the well-being[^a] of Jerusalem: "May those who love you be secure; 









###### 7 




may there be peace within your walls, security within your fortresses." 









###### 8 




Because of my brothers and friends, I will say, "May peace be in you."[^b] 









###### 9 




Because of the house of the Lord our God, I will pursue your prosperity. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

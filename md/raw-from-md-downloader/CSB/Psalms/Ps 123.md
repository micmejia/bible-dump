# Psalms 123

***










###### 1 




I lift my eyes to you, the one enthroned in heaven. 









###### 2 




Like a servant's eyes on his master's hand, like a servant girl's eyes on her mistress's hand, so our eyes are on the Lord our God until he shows us favor. 









###### 3 




Show us favor, Lord, show us favor, for we've had more than enough contempt. 









###### 4 




We've had more than enough scorn from the arrogant and contempt from the proud. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

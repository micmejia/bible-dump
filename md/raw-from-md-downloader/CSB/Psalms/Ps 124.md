# Psalms 124

***










###### 1 




If the Lord had not been on our side-- let Israel say-- 









###### 2 




if the Lord had not been on our side when people attacked us, 









###### 3 




then they would have swallowed us alive in their burning anger against us. 









###### 4 




Then the water would have engulfed us; the torrent would have swept over us; 









###### 5 




the raging water would have swept over us. 









###### 6 




Blessed be the Lord, who has not let us be ripped apart by their teeth. 









###### 7 




We have escaped like a bird from the hunter's net; the net is torn, and we have escaped. 









###### 8

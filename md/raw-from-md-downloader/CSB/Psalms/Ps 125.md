# Psalms 125

***










###### 1 




Those who trust in the Lord are like Mount Zion. It cannot be shaken; it remains forever. 









###### 2 




The mountains surround Jerusalem and the Lord surrounds his people, both now and forever. 









###### 3 




The scepter of the wicked will not remain over the land allotted to the righteous, so that the righteous will not apply their hands to injustice. 









###### 4 




Do what is good, Lord, to the good, to those whose hearts are upright. 









###### 5 




But as for those who turn aside to crooked ways, the Lord will banish them with the evildoers. Peace be with Israel. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

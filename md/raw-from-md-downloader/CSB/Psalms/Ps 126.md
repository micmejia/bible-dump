# Psalms 126

***










###### 1 




When the Lord restored the fortunes of Zion,[^a] we were like those who dream. 









###### 2 




Our mouths were filled with laughter then, and our tongues with shouts of joy. Then they said among the nations, "The Lord has done great things for them." 









###### 3 




The Lord had done great things for us; we were joyful. 









###### 4 




Restore our fortunes,[^b] Lord, like watercourses in the Negev. 









###### 5 




Those who sow in tears will reap with shouts of joy. 









###### 6 




Though one goes along weeping, carrying the bag of seed, he will surely come back with shouts of joy, carrying his sheaves. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Psalms 129

***










###### 1 




Since my youth they have often attacked me-- let Israel say-- 









###### 2 




since my youth they have often attacked me, but they have not prevailed against me. 









###### 3 




Plowmen plowed over my back; they made their furrows long. 









###### 4 




The Lord is righteous; he has cut the ropes of the wicked. 









###### 5 




Let all who hate Zion be driven back in disgrace. 









###### 6 




Let them be like grass on the rooftops, which withers before it grows up[^a] 









###### 7 




and can't even fill the hands of the reaper or the arms of the one who binds sheaves. 









###### 8 




Then none who pass by will say, "May the Lord's blessing be on you. We bless you in the name of the Lord." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

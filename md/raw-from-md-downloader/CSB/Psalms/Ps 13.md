# Psalms 13

***










###### 1 




How long, Lord? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me? 









###### 2 




How long will I store up anxious concerns[^a] within me, agony in my mind every day? How long will my enemy dominate me? 









###### 3 




Consider me and answer, Lord my God. Restore brightness to my eyes; otherwise, I will sleep in death. 









###### 4 




My enemy will say, "I have triumphed over him," and my foes will rejoice because I am shaken. 









###### 5 




But I have trusted in your faithful love; my heart will rejoice in your deliverance. 









###### 6 




I will sing to the Lord because he has treated me generously. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

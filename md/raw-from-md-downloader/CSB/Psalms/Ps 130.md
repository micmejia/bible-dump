# Psalms 130

***










###### 1 




Out of the depths I call to you, Lord! 









###### 2 




Lord, listen to my voice; let your ears be attentive to my cry for help. 









###### 3 




Lord, if you kept an account of iniquities, Lord, who could stand? 









###### 4 




But with you there is forgiveness, so that you may be revered. 









###### 5 




I wait for the Lord; I wait and put my hope in his word. 









###### 6 




I wait for the Lord more than watchmen for the morning-- more than watchmen for the morning. 









###### 7 




Israel, put your hope in the Lord. For there is faithful love with the Lord, and with him is redemption in abundance. 









###### 8 




And he will redeem Israel from all its iniquities. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Psalms 131

***










###### 1 




Lord, my heart is not proud; my eyes are not haughty. I do not get involved with things too great or too wondrous for me. 









###### 2 




Instead, I have calmed and quieted my soul like a weaned child with its mother; my soul is like a weaned child. 









###### 3 




Israel, put your hope in the Lord, both now and forever. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

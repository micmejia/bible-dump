# Psalms 142

***










###### 1 




I cry aloud to the Lord; I plead aloud to the Lord for mercy. 









###### 2 




I pour out my complaint before him; I reveal my trouble to him. 









###### 3 




Although my spirit is weak within me, you know my way. Along this path I travel they have hidden a trap for me. 









###### 4 




Look to the right and see:[^a] no one stands up for me; there is no refuge for me; no one cares about me. 









###### 5 




I cry to you, Lord; I say, "You are my shelter, my portion in the land of the living." 









###### 6 




Listen to my cry, for I am very weak. Rescue me from those who pursue me, for they are too strong for me. 









###### 7 




Free me from prison so that I can praise your name. The righteous will gather around me because you deal generously with me. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

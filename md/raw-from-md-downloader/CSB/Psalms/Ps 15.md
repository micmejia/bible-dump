# Psalms 15

***










###### 1 




Lord, who can dwell in your tent? Who can live on your holy mountain? 









###### 2 




The one who lives blamelessly, practices righteousness, and acknowledges the truth in his heart-- 









###### 3 




who does not slander with his tongue, who does not harm his friend or discredit his neighbor, 









###### 4 




who despises the one rejected by the Lord[^a] but honors those who fear the Lord, who keeps his word whatever the cost, 









###### 5 




who does not lend his silver at interest or take a bribe against the innocent-- the one who does these things will never be shaken. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

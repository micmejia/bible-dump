# Psalms 150

***










###### 1 




Hallelujah! Praise God in his sanctuary. Praise him in his mighty expanse. 









###### 2 




Praise him for his powerful acts; praise him for his abundant greatness. 









###### 3 




Praise him with the blast of a ram's horn; praise him with harp and lyre. 









###### 4 




Praise him with tambourine and dance; praise him with strings and flute. 









###### 5 




Praise him with resounding cymbals; praise him with clashing cymbals. 









###### 6 




Let everything that breathes praise the Lord.

# Psalms 2

***










###### 1 




Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain? 









###### 2 




The kings of the earth take their stand, and the rulers conspire together against the Lord and his Anointed One:[^a] 









###### 3 




"Let's tear off their chains and throw their ropes off of us." 









###### 4 




The one enthroned[^b] in heaven laughs; the Lord ridicules them. 









###### 5 




Then he speaks to them in his anger and terrifies them in his wrath: 









###### 6 




"I have installed my king on Zion, my holy mountain." 









###### 7 




I will declare the Lord's decree. He said to me, "You are my Son;[^c] today I have become your Father. 









###### 8 




Ask of me, and I will make the nations your inheritance and the ends of the earth your possession. 









###### 9 




You will break them with an iron scepter; you will shatter them like pottery." 









###### 10 




So now, kings, be wise; receive instruction, you judges of the earth. 









###### 11 




Serve the Lord with reverential awe and rejoice with trembling. 









###### 12 




Pay homage to[^d] the Son or he will be angry and you will perish in your rebellion,[^e] for his anger may ignite at any moment. All who take refuge in him are happy. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Psalms 23

***










###### 1 




The Lord is my shepherd; I have what I need. 









###### 2 




He lets me lie down in green pastures; he leads me beside quiet waters. 









###### 3 




He renews my life; he leads me along the right paths[^a] for his name's sake. 









###### 4 




Even when I go through the darkest valley,[^b] I fear no danger, for you are with me; your rod and your staff--they comfort me. 









###### 5 




You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; you anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. 









###### 6 




Only goodness and faithful love will pursue me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in[^c] the house of the Lord as long as I live.[^d] ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

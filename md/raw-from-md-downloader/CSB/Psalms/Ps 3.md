# Psalms 3

***










###### 1 




Lord, how my foes increase! There are many who attack me. 









###### 2 




Many say about me, "There is no help for him in God."<i class="selah">Selah_ 









###### 3 




But you, Lord, are a shield around me, my glory, and the one who lifts up my head. 









###### 4 




I cry aloud to the Lord, and he answers me from his holy mountain.<i class="selah">Selah_ 









###### 5 




I lie down and sleep; I wake again because the Lord sustains me. 









###### 6 




I will not be afraid of thousands of people who have taken their stand against me on every side. 









###### 7 




Rise up, Lord! Save me, my God! You strike all my enemies on the cheek; you break the teeth of the wicked. 









###### 8 




Salvation belongs to the Lord; may your blessing be on your people.<i class="selah">Selah_ ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Psalms 4

***










###### 1 




Answer me when I call, God, who vindicates me.[^a] You freed me from affliction; be gracious to me and hear my prayer. 









###### 2 




How long, exalted ones,[^b] will my honor be insulted? How long will you love what is worthless and pursue a lie? <i class="selah">Selah_ 









###### 3 




Know that the Lord has set apart the faithful for himself; the Lord will hear when I call to him. 









###### 4 




Be angry[^c] and do not sin; reflect in your heart while on your bed and be silent. <i class="selah">Selah_ 









###### 5 




Offer sacrifices in righteousness[^d] and trust in the Lord. 









###### 6 




Many are asking, "Who can show us anything good?" Let the light of your face shine on us, Lord. 









###### 7 




You have put more joy in my heart than they have when their grain and new wine abound. 









###### 8 




I will both lie down and sleep in peace, for you alone, Lord, make me live in safety. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Psalms 43

***










###### 1 




Vindicate me, God, and champion my cause against an unfaithful nation; rescue me from the deceitful and unjust person. 









###### 2 




For you are the God of my refuge. Why have you rejected me? Why must I go about in sorrow because of the enemy's oppression? 









###### 3 




Send your light and your truth; let them lead me. Let them bring me to your holy mountain, to your dwelling place. 









###### 4 




Then I will come to the altar of God, to God, my greatest joy. I will praise you with the lyre, God, my God. 









###### 5 




Why, my soul, are you so dejected? Why are you in such turmoil? Put your hope in God, for I will still praise him, my Savior and my God. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

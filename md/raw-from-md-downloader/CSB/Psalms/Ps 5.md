# Psalms 5

***










###### 1 




Listen to my words, Lord; consider my sighing. 









###### 2 




Pay attention to the sound of my cry, my King and my God, for I pray to you. 









###### 3 




In the morning, Lord, you hear my voice; in the morning I plead my case to you and watch expectantly. 









###### 4 




For you are not a God who delights in wickedness; evil cannot dwell with you. 









###### 5 




The boastful cannot stand in your sight; you hate all evildoers. 









###### 6 




You destroy those who tell lies; the Lord abhors violent and treacherous people. 









###### 7 




But I enter your house by the abundance of your faithful love; I bow down toward your holy temple in reverential awe of you. 









###### 8 




Lord, lead me in your righteousness because of my adversaries; make your way straight before me. 









###### 9 




For there is nothing reliable in what they say; destruction is within them; their throat is an open grave; they flatter with their tongues. 









###### 10 




Punish them, God; let them fall by their own schemes. Drive them out because of their many crimes, for they rebel against you. 









###### 11 




But let all who take refuge in you rejoice; let them shout for joy forever. May you shelter them, and may those who love your name boast about you. 









###### 12 




For you, Lord, bless the righteous one; you surround him with favor like a shield. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

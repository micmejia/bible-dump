# Psalms 53

***










###### 1 




The fool says in his heart, "There's no God." They are corrupt, and they do vile deeds. There is no one who does good. 









###### 2 




God looks down from heaven on the human race[^a] to see if there is one who is wise, one who seeks God. 









###### 3 




All have turned away; all alike have become corrupt. There is no one who does good, not even one. 









###### 4 




Will evildoers never understand? They consume my people as they consume bread; they do not call on God. 









###### 5 




Then they will be filled with dread-- dread like no other-- because God will scatter the bones of those who besiege you. You will put them to shame, for God has rejected them. 









###### 6 




Oh, that Israel's deliverance would come from Zion! When God restores the fortunes of his people,[^b] let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

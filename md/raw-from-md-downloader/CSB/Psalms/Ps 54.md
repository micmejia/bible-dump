# Psalms 54

***










###### 1 




God, save me by your name, and vindicate me by your might! 









###### 2 




God, hear my prayer; listen to the words from my mouth. 









###### 3 




For strangers rise up against me, and violent men intend to kill me. They do not let God guide them.[^a]<i class="selah">Selah_ 









###### 4 




God is my helper; the Lord is the sustainer of my life.[^b] 









###### 5 




He will repay my adversaries for their evil. Because of your faithfulness, annihilate them. 









###### 6 




I will sacrifice a freewill offering to you. I will praise your name, Lord, because it is good. 









###### 7 




For he has rescued me from every trouble, and my eye has looked down on my enemies. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

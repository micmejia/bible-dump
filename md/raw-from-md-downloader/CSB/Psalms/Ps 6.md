# Psalms 6

***










###### 1 




Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger; do not discipline me in your wrath. 









###### 2 




Be gracious to me, Lord, for I am weak;[^a] heal me, Lord, for my bones are shaking; 









###### 3 




my whole being is shaken with terror. And you, Lord--how long? 









###### 4 




Turn, Lord! Rescue me; save me because of your faithful love. 









###### 5 




For there is no remembrance of you in death; who can thank you in Sheol? 









###### 6 




I am weary from my groaning; with my tears I dampen my bed and drench my couch every night. 









###### 7 




My eyes are swollen from grief; they grow old because of all my enemies. 









###### 8 




Depart from me, all evildoers, for the Lord has heard the sound of my weeping. 









###### 9 




The Lord has heard my plea for help; the Lord accepts my prayer. 









###### 10 




All my enemies will be ashamed and shake with terror; they will turn back and suddenly be disgraced. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

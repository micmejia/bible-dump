# Psalms 61

***










###### 1 




God, hear my cry; pay attention to my prayer. 









###### 2 




I call to you from the ends of the earth when my heart is without strength. Lead me to a rock that is high above me, 









###### 3 




for you have been a refuge for me, a strong tower in the face of the enemy. 









###### 4 




I will dwell in your tent forever and take refuge under the shelter of your wings.<i class="selah">Selah_ 









###### 5 




God, you have heard my vows; you have given a heritage to those who fear your name. 









###### 6 




Add days to the king's life; may his years span many generations. 









###### 7 




May he sit enthroned before God forever. Appoint faithful love and truth to guard him. 









###### 8 




Then I will continually sing of your name, fulfilling my vows day by day. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Psalms 62

***










###### 1 




I am at rest in God alone; my salvation comes from him. 









###### 2 




He alone is my rock and my salvation, my stronghold; I will never be shaken. 









###### 3 




How long will you threaten a man? Will all of you attack[^a] as if he were a leaning wall or a tottering fence?

###### 9

###### 10

###### 11 




God has spoken once; I have heard this twice: strength belongs to God, 









###### 12 




and faithful love belongs to you, Lord.

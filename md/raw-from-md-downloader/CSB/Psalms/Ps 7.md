# Psalms 7

***










###### 1 




Lord my God, I seek refuge in you; save me from all my pursuers and rescue me, 









###### 2 




or they[^a] will tear me like a lion, ripping me apart with no one to rescue me. 









###### 3 




Lord my God, if I have done this, if there is injustice on my hands, 









###### 4 




if I have done harm to one at peace with me or have plundered[^b] my adversary without cause, 









###### 5 




may an enemy pursue and overtake me; may he trample me to the ground and leave my honor in the dust.<i class="selah">Selah_ 









###### 6 




Rise up, Lord, in your anger; lift yourself up against the fury of my adversaries; awake for me;[^c] you have ordained a judgment. 









###### 7 




Let the assembly of peoples gather around you; take your seat on high over it. 









###### 8 




The Lord judges the peoples; vindicate me, Lord, according to my righteousness and my integrity. 









###### 9 




Let the evil of the wicked come to an end, but establish the righteous. The one who examines the thoughts and emotions[^d] is a righteous God. 









###### 10 




My shield is with God, who saves the upright in heart. 









###### 11 




God is a righteous judge and a God who shows his wrath every day. 









###### 12 




If anyone does not repent, he will sharpen his sword; he has strung his bow and made it ready. 









###### 13 




He has prepared his deadly weapons; he tips his arrows with fire. 









###### 14 




See, the wicked one is pregnant with evil, conceives trouble, and gives birth to deceit. 









###### 15 




He dug a pit and hollowed it out but fell into the hole he had made. 









###### 16 




His trouble comes back on his own head; his own violence comes down on top of his head. 









###### 17 




I will thank the Lord for his righteousness; I will sing about the name of the Lord Most High. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

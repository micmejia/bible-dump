# Psalms 70

***










###### 1 




God, hurry to rescue me. Lord, hurry to help me! 









###### 2 




Let those who seek to kill me be disgraced and confounded; let those who wish me harm be turned back and humiliated. 









###### 3 




Let those who say, "Aha, aha!" retreat because of their shame. 









###### 4 




Let all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; let those who love your salvation continually say, "God is great!" 









###### 5 




I am oppressed and needy; hurry to me, God. You are my help and my deliverer; Lord, do not delay. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

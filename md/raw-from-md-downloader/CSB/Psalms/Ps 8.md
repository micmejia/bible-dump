# Psalms 8

***










###### 1 




Lord, our Lord, how magnificent is your name throughout the earth! You have covered the heavens with your majesty.[^a] 









###### 2 




From the mouths of infants and nursing babies, you have established a stronghold[^b] on account of your adversaries in order to silence the enemy and the avenger. 









###### 3 




When I observe your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you set in place, 









###### 4 




what is a human being that you remember him, a son of man[^c] that you look after him? 









###### 5 




You made him little less than God[^d][^e] and crowned him with glory and honor. 









###### 6 




You made him ruler over the works of your hands; you put everything under his feet: 









###### 7 




all the sheep and oxen, as well as the animals in the wild, 









###### 8 




the birds of the sky, and the fish of the sea that pass through the currents of the seas. 









###### 9

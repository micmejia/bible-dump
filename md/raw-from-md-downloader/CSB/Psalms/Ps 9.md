# Psalms 9

***










###### 1 




I will thank the Lord with all my heart; I will declare all your wondrous works. 









###### 2 




I will rejoice and boast about you; I will sing about your name, Most High. 









###### 3 




When my enemies retreat, they stumble and perish before you. 









###### 4 




For you have upheld my just cause; you are seated on your throne as a righteous judge. 









###### 5 




You have rebuked the nations: You have destroyed the wicked; you have erased their name forever and ever. 









###### 6 




The enemy has come to eternal ruin; you have uprooted the cities, and the very memory of them has perished. 









###### 7 




But the Lord sits enthroned forever; he has established his throne for judgment. 









###### 8 




And he judges the world with righteousness; he executes judgment on the nations with fairness. 









###### 9 




The Lord is a refuge for the persecuted, a refuge in times of trouble. 









###### 10 




Those who know your name trust in you because you have not abandoned those who seek you, Lord. 









###### 11 




Sing to the Lord, who dwells in Zion; proclaim his deeds among the nations. 









###### 12 




For the one who seeks an accounting for bloodshed remembers them; he does not forget the cry of the oppressed. 









###### 13 




Be gracious to me, Lord; consider my affliction at the hands of those who hate me. Lift me up from the gates of death, 









###### 14 




so that I may declare all your praises. I will rejoice in your salvation within the gates of Daughter Zion. 









###### 15 




The nations have fallen into the pit they made; their foot is caught in the net they have concealed. 









###### 16 




The Lord has made himself known; he has executed justice, snaring the wicked by the work of their hands.<em>Higgaion</em>. <i class="selah">Selah_ 









###### 17 




The wicked will return to Sheol-- all the nations that forget God. 









###### 18 




For the needy will not always be forgotten; the hope of the oppressed[^a] will not perish forever. 









###### 19 




Rise up, Lord! Do not let mere humans prevail; let the nations be judged in your presence. 









###### 20 




Put terror in them, Lord; let the nations know they are only humans.<i class="selah">Selah_ ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

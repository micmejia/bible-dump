# Psalms 93

***










###### 1 




The Lord reigns! He is robed in majesty; the Lord is robed, enveloped in strength. The world is firmly established; it cannot be shaken. 









###### 2 




Your throne has been established from the beginning;[^a] you are from eternity. 









###### 3 




The floods have lifted up, Lord, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their pounding waves. 









###### 4 




Greater than the roar of a huge torrent-- the mighty breakers of the sea-- the Lord on high is majestic. 









###### 5 




Lord, your testimonies are completely reliable; holiness adorns your house for all the days to come. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

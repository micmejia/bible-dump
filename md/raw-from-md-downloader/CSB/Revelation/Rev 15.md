# Revelation 15

***










###### 1 




Then I saw another great and awe-inspiring sign[^a] in heaven: seven angels with the seven last plagues; for with them God's wrath will be completed. 









###### 2 




I also saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire, and those who had won the victory over the beast, its image,[^b] and the number of its name, were standing on the sea of glass with harps from God. 









###### 3 




They sang the song of God's servant Moses and the song of the Lamb: Great and awe-inspiring are your works, Lord God, the Almighty; just and true are your ways, King of the nations.[^c] 









###### 4 




Lord, who will not fear and glorify your name? For you alone are holy. All the nations will come and worship before you because your righteous acts have been revealed. 









###### 5 




After this I looked, and the heavenly temple--the tabernacle of testimony--was opened. 









###### 6 




Out of the temple came the seven angels with the seven plagues, dressed in pure, bright linen, with golden sashes wrapped around their chests. 









###### 7 




One of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls filled with the wrath of God who lives forever and ever. 









###### 8 




Then the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power, and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Revelation 21

***










###### 1 




Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more. 









###### 2 




I also saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared like a bride adorned for her husband. 









###### 3 




Then I heard a loud voice from the throne:[^a] Look, God's dwelling[^b] is with humanity, and he will live with them. They will be his peoples,[^c] and God himself will be with them and will be their God.[^d] 









###### 4 




He will wipe away every tear from their eyes. Death will be no more; grief, crying, and pain will be no more, because the previous things[^e] have passed away. 









###### 5 




Then the one seated on the throne said, "Look, I am making everything new." He also said, "Write, because these words[^f] are faithful and true." 









###### 6 




Then he said to me, "It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will freely give to the thirsty from the spring of the water of life. 









###### 7 




The one who conquers will inherit these things, and I will be his God, and he will be my son. 









###### 8 




But the cowards, faithless,[^g] detestable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars--their share will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death." ## The New Jerusalem 









###### 9 




Then one of the seven angels, who had held the seven bowls filled with the seven last plagues, came and spoke with me: "Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb." 









###### 10 




He then carried me away in the Spirit[^h] to a great, high mountain and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, 









###### 11 




arrayed with God's glory. Her radiance was like a precious jewel, like a jasper stone, clear as crystal. 









###### 12 




The city had a massive high wall, with twelve gates. Twelve angels were at the gates; the names of the twelve tribes of Israel's sons were inscribed on the gates. 









###### 13 




There were three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west. 









###### 14 




The city wall had twelve foundations, and the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb were on the foundations. 









###### 15 




The one who spoke with me had a golden measuring rod to measure the city, its gates, and its wall. 









###### 16 




The city is laid out in a square; its length and width are the same. He measured the city with the rod at 12,000 <em>stadia</em>.[^i] Its length, width, and height are equal. 









###### 17 




Then he measured its wall, 144 cubits according to human measurement, which the angel used. 









###### 18 




The building material of its wall was jasper, and the city was pure gold clear as glass. 









###### 19 




The foundations of the city wall were adorned with every kind of jewel: the first foundation is jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald, 









###### 20 




the fifth sardonyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst. 









###### 21 




The twelve gates are twelve pearls; each individual gate was made of a single pearl. The main street[^j] of the city was pure gold, transparent as glass. 









###### 22 




I did not see a temple in it, because the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are its temple. 









###### 23 




The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, because the glory of God illuminates it, and its lamp is the Lamb. 









###### 24 




The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it.[^k] 









###### 25 




Its gates will never close by day because it will never be night there. 









###### 26 




They will bring the glory and honor of the nations into it.[^l] 









###### 27 




Nothing unclean will ever enter it, nor anyone who does what is detestable or false, but only those written in the Lamb's book of life. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

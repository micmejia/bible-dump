# Revelation 4

***










###### 1 




After this I looked, and there in heaven was an open door. The first voice that I had heard speaking to me like a trumpet said, "Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after this." 









###### 2 




Immediately I was in the Spirit, and there was a throne in heaven and someone was seated on it. 









###### 3 




The one seated[^a] there had the appearance of jasper and carnelian stone. A rainbow that had the appearance of an emerald surrounded the throne. 









###### 4 




Around the throne were twenty-four thrones, and on the thrones sat twenty-four elders dressed in white clothes, with golden crowns on their heads. 









###### 5 




Flashes of lightning and rumblings and peals of thunder came from the throne. Seven fiery torches were burning before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God. 









###### 6 




Something like a sea of glass, similar to crystal, was also before the throne. Four living creatures covered with eyes in front and in back were around the throne on each side. 









###### 7 




The first living creature was like a lion; the second living creature was like an ox; the third living creature had a face like a man; and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle. 









###### 8 




Each of the four living creatures had six wings; they were covered with eyes around and inside. Day and night they never stop,[^b] saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God, the Almighty, who was, who is, and who is to come. 









###### 9 




Whenever the living creatures give glory, honor, and thanks to the one seated on the throne, the one who lives forever and ever, 









###### 10 




the twenty-four elders fall down before the one seated on the throne and worship the one who lives forever and ever. They cast their crowns before the throne and say, 









###### 11

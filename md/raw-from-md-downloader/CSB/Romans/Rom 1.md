# Romans 1

***










###### 1 




Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle[^a] and set apart for the gospel of God-- 









###### 2 




which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures-- 









###### 3 




concerning his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, who was a descendant of David[^b] according to the flesh 









###### 4 




and was appointed to be the powerful Son of God according to the Spirit of holiness[^c] by the resurrection of the dead. 









###### 5 




Through him we have received grace and apostleship to bring about[^d] the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the Gentiles,[^e] 









###### 6 




including you who are also called by Jesus Christ. 









###### 7 




To all who are in Rome, loved by God, called as saints. Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. ## Paul's Desire to Visit Rome 









###### 8 




First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you because the news of your faith[^f] is being reported in all the world. 









###### 9 




God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in telling the good news about his Son--that I constantly mention you, 









###### 10 




always asking in my prayers that if it is somehow in God's will, I may now at last succeed in coming to you. 









###### 11 




For I want very much to see you, so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you, 









###### 12 




that is, to be mutually encouraged by each other's faith, both yours and mine. 









###### 13 




Now I don't want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, that I often planned to come to you (but was prevented until now) in order that I might have a fruitful ministry[^g] among you, just as I have had among the rest of the Gentiles. 









###### 14 




I am obligated both to Greeks and barbarians,[^h] both to the wise and the foolish. 









###### 15 




So I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome. ## The Righteous Will Live by Faith 









###### 16 




For I am not ashamed of the gospel,[^i] because it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, first to the Jew, and also to the Greek. 









###### 17 




For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith,[^j] just as it is written: <b class="quote">The righteous will live by faith.**[^k][^l] ## The Guilt of the Gentile World 









###### 18 




For God's wrath is revealed from heaven against all godlessness and unrighteousness of people who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth, 









###### 19 




since what can be known[^m] about God is evident among them, because God has shown it to them. 









###### 20 




For his invisible attributes, that is, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen since the creation of the world, being understood through what he has made. As a result, people are without excuse. 









###### 21 




For though they knew God, they did not glorify him as God or show gratitude. Instead, their thinking became worthless, and their senseless hearts were darkened. 









###### 22 




Claiming to be wise, they became fools 









###### 23 




and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man, birds, four-footed animals, and reptiles. 









###### 24 




Therefore God delivered them over in the desires of their hearts to sexual impurity, so that their bodies were degraded among themselves. 









###### 25 




They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served what has been created instead of the Creator, who is praised forever. Amen. ## From Idolatry to Depravity 









###### 26 




For this reason God delivered them over to disgraceful passions. Their women[^n] exchanged natural sexual relations[^o] for unnatural ones. 









###### 27 




The men[^p] in the same way also left natural relations with women and were inflamed in their lust for one another. Men committed shameless acts with men and received in their own persons[^q] the appropriate penalty of their error. 









###### 28 




And because they did not think it worthwhile to acknowledge God, God delivered them over to a corrupt mind so that they do what is not right. 









###### 29 




They are filled with all unrighteousness,[^r] evil, greed, and wickedness. They are full of envy, murder, quarrels, deceit, and malice. They are gossips, 









###### 30 




slanderers, God-haters, arrogant, proud, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, 









###### 31 




senseless, untrustworthy, unloving,[^s] and unmerciful. 









###### 32 




Although they know God's just sentence--that those who practice such things deserve to die[^t]--they not only do them, but even applaud[^u] others who practice them. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

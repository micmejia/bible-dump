# Romans 10

***










###### 1 




Brothers and sisters, my heart's desire and prayer to God concerning them[^a] is for their salvation. 









###### 2 




I can testify about them that they have zeal for God, but not according to knowledge. 









###### 3 




Since they are ignorant of the righteousness of God and attempted to establish their own righteousness, they have not submitted to God's righteousness. 









###### 4 




For Christ is the end[^b] of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes, 









###### 5 




since Moses writes about the righteousness that is from the law: <b class="quote">The one who does these things will live by them.**[^c] 









###### 6 




But the righteousness that comes from faith speaks like this: <b class="quote">Do not say in your heart, "Who will go up to heaven?"**[^d] that is, to bring Christ down 









###### 7 




or, <b class="quote">"Who will go down into the abyss?"**[^e] that is, to bring Christ up from the dead. 









###### 8 




On the contrary, what does it say? <b class="quote">The message is near you, in your mouth and in your heart.**[^f] This is the message of faith that we proclaim: 









###### 9 




If you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 









###### 10 




One believes with the heart, resulting in righteousness, and one confesses with the mouth, resulting in salvation. 









###### 11 




For the Scripture says, <b class="quote">Everyone who believes on him will not be put to shame,**[^g] 









###### 12 




since there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, because the same Lord of all richly blesses all who call on him. 









###### 13 




For <b class="quote">everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.**[^h] ## Israel's Rejection of the Message 









###### 14 




How, then, can they call on him they have not believed in? And how can they believe without hearing about him? And how can they hear without a preacher? 









###### 15 




And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written: <b class="quote">How beautiful**[^i] <b class="quote">are the feet of those who bring good news.**[^j] 









###### 16 




But not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, <b class="quote">Lord, who has believed our message?**[^k] 









###### 17 




So faith comes from what is heard, and what is heard comes through the message about Christ.[^l] 









###### 18 




But I ask, "Did they not hear?" Yes, they did: <b class="quote">Their voice has gone out to the whole earth,** <b class="quote">and their words to the ends of the world.**[^m] 









###### 19 




But I ask, "Did Israel not understand?" First, Moses said, <b class="quote">I will make you jealous** <b class="quote">of those who are not a nation;** <b class="quote">I will make you angry by a nation** <b class="quote">that lacks understanding.**[^n] 









###### 20 




And Isaiah says boldly, <b class="quote">I was found** <b class="quote">by those who were not looking for me;** <b class="quote">I revealed myself** <b class="quote">to those who were not asking for me.**[^o] 









###### 21 




But to Israel he says, <b class="quote">All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and defiant people.**[^p] ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Romans 11

***










###### 1 




I ask, then, has God rejected his people? Absolutely not! For I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin. 









###### 2 




God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Or don't you know what the Scripture says in the passage about Elijah--how he pleads with God against Israel? 









###### 3 




<b class="quote">Lord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars. I am the only one left, and they are trying to take my life!**[^a] 









###### 4 




But what was God's answer to him? <b class="quote">I have left seven thousand for myself who have not bowed down to Baal.**[^b] 









###### 5 




In the same way, then, there is also at the present time a remnant chosen by grace. 









###### 6 




Now if by grace, then it is not by works; otherwise grace ceases to be grace.[^c] 









###### 7 




What then? Israel did not find what it was looking for, but the elect did find it. The rest were hardened, 









###### 8 




as it is written, <b class="quote">God gave them a spirit of stupor,** <b class="quote">eyes that cannot see** <b class="quote">and ears that cannot hear,** <b class="quote">to this day**.[^d] 









###### 9 




And David says, <b class="quote">Let their table become a snare and a trap,** <b class="quote">a pitfall and a retribution to them.** 









###### 10 




<b class="quote">Let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see,** <b class="quote">and their backs be bent continually.**[^e] ## Israel's Rejection Not Final 









###### 11 




I ask, then, have they stumbled so as to fall? Absolutely not! On the contrary, by their transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel jealous. 









###### 12 




Now if their transgression brings riches for the world, and their failure riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their fullness bring! 









###### 13 




Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Insofar as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry, 









###### 14 




if I might somehow make my own people[^f] jealous and save some of them. 









###### 15 




For if their rejection brings reconciliation to the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead? 









###### 16 




Now if the firstfruits are holy, so is the whole batch. And if the root is holy, so are the branches. 









###### 17 




Now if some of the branches were broken off, and you, though a wild olive branch, were grafted in among them and have come to share in the rich root[^g] of the cultivated olive tree, 









###### 18 




do not boast that you are better than those branches. But if you do boast--you do not sustain the root, but the root sustains you. 









###### 19 




Then you will say, "Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in." 









###### 20 




True enough; they were broken off because of unbelief, but you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but beware,[^h] 









###### 21 




because if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either. 









###### 22 




Therefore, consider God's kindness and severity: severity toward those who have fallen but God's kindness toward you--if you remain in his kindness. Otherwise you too will be cut off. 









###### 23 




And even they, if they do not remain in unbelief, will be grafted in, because God has the power to graft them in again. 









###### 24 




For if you were cut off from your native wild olive tree and against nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these--the natural branches--be grafted into their own olive tree? 









###### 25 




I don't want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers and sisters, so that you will not be conceited: A partial hardening has come upon Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in. 









###### 26 




And in this way all[^i] Israel will be saved, as it is written, <b class="quote">The Deliverer will come from Zion;** <b class="quote">he will turn godlessness away from Jacob.** 









###### 27 




<b class="quote">And this will be my covenant with them**[^j] <b class="quote">when I take away their sins.**[^k] 









###### 28 




Regarding the gospel, they are enemies for your advantage, but regarding election, they are loved because of the patriarchs, 









###### 29 




since God's gracious gifts and calling are irrevocable.[^l] 









###### 30 




As you once disobeyed God but now have received mercy through their disobedience, 









###### 31 




so they too have now disobeyed, resulting in mercy to you, so that they also may now[^m] receive mercy. 









###### 32 




For God has imprisoned all in disobedience so that he may have mercy on all. ## A Hymn of Praise 









###### 33 




Oh, the depth of the riches and the wisdom and the knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments and untraceable his ways! 









###### 34 




<b class="quote">For who has known the mind of the Lord?** <b class="quote">Or who has been his counselor?** 









###### 35 




<b class="quote">And who has ever given to God,** <b class="quote">that he should be repaid?**[^n] 









###### 36 




For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be the glory forever. Amen. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

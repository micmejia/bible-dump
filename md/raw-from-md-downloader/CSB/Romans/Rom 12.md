# Romans 12

***










###### 1 




Therefore, brothers and sisters, in view of the mercies of God, I urge you to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God; this is your true worship.[^a] 









###### 2 




Do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may discern what is the good, pleasing, and perfect will of God. ## Many Gifts but One Body 









###### 3 




For by the grace given to me, I tell everyone among you not to think of himself more highly than he should think. Instead, think sensibly, as God has distributed a measure of faith to each one. 









###### 4 




Now as we have many parts in one body, and all the parts do not have the same function, 









###### 5 




in the same way we who are many are one body in Christ and individually members of one another. 









###### 6 




According to the grace given to us, we have different gifts: If prophecy, use it according to the proportion of one's[^b] faith; 









###### 7 




if service, use it in service; if teaching, in teaching; 









###### 8 




if exhorting, in exhortation; giving, with generosity; leading, with diligence; showing mercy, with cheerfulness. ## Christian Ethics 









###### 9 




Let love be without hypocrisy. Detest evil; cling to what is good. 









###### 10 




Love one another deeply as brothers and sisters. Take the lead in honoring one another. 









###### 11 




Do not lack diligence in zeal; be fervent in the Spirit;[^c] serve the Lord. 









###### 12 




Rejoice in hope; be patient in affliction; be persistent in prayer. 









###### 13 




Share with the saints in their needs; pursue hospitality. 









###### 14 




Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse. 









###### 15 




Rejoice with those who rejoice; weep with those who weep. 









###### 16 




Live in harmony with one another. Do not be proud; instead, associate with the humble. Do not be wise in your own estimation. 









###### 17 




Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Give careful thought to do what is honorable in everyone's eyes. 









###### 18 




If possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone. 









###### 19 




Friends, do not avenge yourselves; instead, leave room for God's wrath, because it is written, <b class="quote">Vengeance belongs to me; I will repay,**[^d] says the Lord. 









###### 20 




But <b class="quote">If your enemy is hungry, feed him.** <b class="quote">If he is thirsty, give him something to drink.** <b class="quote">For in so doing** <b class="quote">you will be heaping fiery coals on his head.**[^e] 









###### 21 




Do not be conquered by evil, but conquer evil with good. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

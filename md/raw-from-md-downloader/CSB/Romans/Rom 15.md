# Romans 15

***










###### 1 




Now we who are strong have an obligation to bear the weaknesses of those without strength, and not to please ourselves. 









###### 2 




Each one of us is to please his neighbor for his good, to build him up. 









###### 3 




For even Christ did not please himself. On the contrary, as it is written, <b class="quote">The insults of those who insult you have fallen on me.**[^a] 









###### 4 




For whatever was written in the past was written for our instruction, so that we may have hope through endurance and through the encouragement from the Scriptures. 









###### 5 




Now may the God who gives[^b] endurance and encouragement grant you to live in harmony with one another, according to Christ Jesus, 









###### 6 




so that you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ with one mind and one voice. ## Glorifying God Together 









###### 7 




Therefore welcome one another, just as[^c] Christ also welcomed you, to the glory of God. 









###### 8 




For I say that Christ became a servant of the circumcised[^d] on behalf of God's truth, to confirm the promises to the fathers, 









###### 9 




and so that Gentiles may glorify God for his mercy. As it is written, <b class="quote">Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles,** <b class="quote">and I will sing praise to your name.**[^e] 









###### 10 




Again it says, <b class="quote">Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people!**[^f] 









###### 11 




And again, <b class="quote">Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles;** <b class="quote">let all the peoples praise him!**[^g] 









###### 12 




And again, Isaiah says, <b class="quote">The root of Jesse** <b class="quote">will appear,** <b class="quote">the one who rises to rule the Gentiles;** <b class="quote">the Gentiles will hope in him.**[^h] 









###### 13 




Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you believe so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit. ## From Jerusalem to Illyricum 









###### 14 




My brothers and sisters, I myself am convinced about you that you also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, and able to instruct one another. 









###### 15 




Nevertheless, I have written to remind you more boldly on some points[^i] because of the grace given me by God 









###### 16 




to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, serving as a priest of the gospel of God. God's purpose is that the Gentiles may be an acceptable offering, sanctified by the Holy Spirit. 









###### 17 




Therefore I have reason to boast in Christ Jesus regarding what pertains to God. 









###### 18 




For I would not dare say anything except what Christ has accomplished through me by word and deed for the obedience of the Gentiles, 









###### 19 




by the power of miraculous signs and wonders, and by the power of God's Spirit. As a result, I have fully proclaimed the gospel of Christ from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum.[^j] 









###### 20 




My aim is to preach the gospel where Christ has not been named, so that I will not build on someone else's foundation, 









###### 21 




but, as it is written, <b class="quote">Those who were not told about him will see,** <b class="quote">and those who have not heard will understand.**[^k] ## Paul's Travel Plans 









###### 22 




That is why I have been prevented many times from coming to you. 









###### 23 




But now I no longer have any work to do in these regions,[^l] and I have strongly desired for many years to come to you 









###### 24 




whenever I travel to Spain.[^m] For I hope to see you when I pass through and to be assisted by you for my journey there, once I have first enjoyed your company for a while. 









###### 25 




Right now I am traveling to Jerusalem to serve the saints, 









###### 26 




because Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem. 









###### 27 




Yes, they were pleased, and indeed are indebted to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual benefits, then they are obligated to minister to them in material needs. 









###### 28 




So when I have finished this and safely delivered the funds[^n] to them,[^o] I will visit you on the way to Spain. 









###### 29 




I know that when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing[^p] of Christ. 









###### 30 




Now I appeal to you, brothers and sisters, through our Lord Jesus Christ and through the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in prayers to God on my behalf. 









###### 31 




Pray that I may be rescued from the unbelievers in Judea, that my ministry to[^q] Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints, 









###### 32 




and that, by God's will, I may come to you with joy and be refreshed together with you. 









###### 33 




May the God of peace be with all of you. Amen. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

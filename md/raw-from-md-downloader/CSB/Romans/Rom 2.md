# Romans 2

***










###### 1 




Therefore, every one of you[^a] who judges is without excuse. For when you judge another, you condemn yourself, since you, the judge, do the same things. 









###### 2 




Now we know that God's judgment on those who do such things is based on the truth. 









###### 3 




Do you think--anyone of you who judges those who do such things yet do the same--that you will escape God's judgment? 









###### 4 




Or do you despise the riches of his kindness, restraint, and patience, not recognizing[^b] that God's kindness is intended to lead you to repentance? 









###### 5 




Because of your hardened and unrepentant heart you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of wrath, when God's righteous judgment is revealed. 









###### 6 




<b class="quote">He will repay each one according to his works**:[^c] 









###### 7 




eternal life to those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor, and immortality; 









###### 8 




but wrath and anger to those who are self-seeking and disobey the truth while obeying unrighteousness. 









###### 9 




There will be affliction and distress for every human being who does evil, first to the Jew, and also to the Greek; 









###### 10 




but glory, honor, and peace for everyone who does what is good, first to the Jew, and also to the Greek. 









###### 11 




For there is no favoritism with God. 









###### 12 




For all who sin without the law will also perish without the law, and all who sin under[^d] the law will be judged by the law. 









###### 13 




For the hearers of the law are not righteous before God, but the doers of the law will be justified.[^e] 









###### 14 




So, when Gentiles, who do not by nature have the law, do[^f] what the law demands, they are a law to themselves even though they do not have the law. 









###### 15 




They show that the work of the law[^g] is written on their hearts. Their consciences confirm this. Their competing thoughts either accuse or even excuse them[^h] 









###### 16 




on the day when God judges what people have kept secret, according to my gospel through Christ Jesus. ## Jewish Violation of the Law 









###### 17 




Now if[^i] you call yourself a Jew, and rely on the law, and boast in God, 









###### 18 




and know his will, and approve the things that are superior, being instructed from the law, 









###### 19 




and if you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind, a light to those in darkness, 









###### 20 




an instructor of the ignorant, a teacher of the immature, having the embodiment of knowledge and truth in the law-- 









###### 21 




you then, who teach another, don't you teach yourself? You who preach, "You must not steal"--do you steal? 









###### 22 




You who say, "You must not commit adultery"--do you commit adultery? You who detest idols, do you rob temples? 









###### 23 




You who boast in the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law?[^j] 









###### 24 




For, as it is written: <b class="quote">The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.**[^k] ## Circumcision of the Heart 









###### 25 




Circumcision benefits you if you observe the law, but if you are a lawbreaker, your circumcision has become uncircumcision. 









###### 26 




So if an uncircumcised man keeps the law's requirements, will not his uncircumcision be counted as circumcision? 









###### 27 




A man who is physically uncircumcised, but who keeps the law, will judge you who are a lawbreaker in spite of having the letter of the law and circumcision. 









###### 28 




For a person is not a Jew who is one outwardly, and true circumcision is not something visible in the flesh. 









###### 29 




On the contrary, a person is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is of the heart--by the Spirit, not the letter.[^l] That person's praise is not from people but from God. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

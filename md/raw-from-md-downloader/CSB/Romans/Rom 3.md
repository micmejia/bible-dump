# Romans 3

***










###### 1 




So what advantage does the Jew have? Or what is the benefit of circumcision? 









###### 2 




Considerable in every way. First, they were entrusted with the very words of God. 









###### 3 




What then? If some were unfaithful, will their unfaithfulness nullify God's faithfulness? 









###### 4 




Absolutely not! Let God be true, even though everyone is a liar, as it is written: <b class="quote">That you may be justified in your words** <b class="quote">and triumph when you judge.**[^a] 









###### 5 




But if our unrighteousness highlights[^b] God's righteousness, what are we to say? I am using a human argument:[^c] Is God unrighteous to inflict wrath? 









###### 6 




Absolutely not! Otherwise, how will God judge the world? 









###### 7 




But if by my lie God's truth abounds to his glory, why am I also still being judged as a sinner? 









###### 8 




And why not say, just as some people slanderously claim we say, "Let us do what is evil so that good may come"? Their condemnation is deserved! ## The Whole World Guilty before God 









###### 9 




What then? Are we any better off?[^d] Not at all! For we have already charged that both Jews and Greeks are all under sin,[^e] 









###### 10 




as it is written: <b class="quote">There is no one righteous, not even one.** 









###### 11 




<b class="quote">There is no one who understands;** <b class="quote">there is no one who seeks God.** 









###### 12 




<b class="quote">All have turned away;** <b class="quote">all alike have become worthless.** <b class="quote">There is no one who does what is good,** <b class="quote">not even one.**[^f] 









###### 13 




<b class="quote">Their throat is an open grave;** <b class="quote">they deceive with their tongues.**[^g] <b class="quote">Vipers' venom is under their lips.**[^h] 









###### 14 




<b class="quote">Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.**[^i] 









###### 15 




<b class="quote">Their feet are swift to shed blood;** 









###### 16 




<b class="quote">ruin and wretchedness are in their paths,** 









###### 17 




<b class="quote">and the path of peace they have not known.**[^j] 









###### 18 




<b class="quote">There is no fear of God before their eyes.**[^k] 









###### 19 




Now we know that whatever the law says, it speaks to those who are subject to the law,[^l] so that every mouth may be shut and the whole world may become subject to God's judgment.[^m] 









###### 20 




For no one will be justified[^n] in his sight by the works of the law, because the knowledge of sin comes through the law. ## The Righteousness of God through Faith 









###### 21 




But now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been revealed, attested by the Law and the Prophets.[^o] 









###### 22 




The righteousness of God is through faith in Jesus Christ[^p] to all who believe, since there is no distinction. 









###### 23 




For all have sinned and fall short of the[^q] glory of God; 









###### 24 




they are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus. 









###### 25 




God presented him as the mercy seat[^r] by his blood, through faith, to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his restraint God passed over the sins previously committed. 









###### 26 




God presented him to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so that he would be just and justify the one who has faith in Jesus. ## Boasting Excluded 









###### 27 




Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law?[^s] By one of works? No, on the contrary, by a law[^t] of faith. 









###### 28 




For we conclude that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law. 









###### 29 




Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles too? Yes, of Gentiles too, 









###### 30 




since there is one God who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith. 









###### 31 




Do we then nullify the law through faith? Absolutely not! On the contrary, we uphold the law. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Romans 9

***










###### 1 




I speak the truth in Christ--I am not lying; my conscience testifies to me through the Holy Spirit[^a]-- 









###### 2 




that I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart. 









###### 3 




For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off[^b] from Christ for the benefit of my brothers and sisters, my own flesh and blood. 









###### 4 




They are Israelites, and to them belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the temple service, and the promises. 









###### 5 




The ancestors are theirs, and from them, by physical descent,[^c] came the Christ, who is God over all, praised forever.[^d] Amen. ## God's Gracious Election of Israel 









###### 6 




Now it is not as though the word of God has failed, because not all who are descended from Israel are Israel. 









###### 7 




Neither is it the case that all of Abraham's children are his descendants.[^e] On the contrary, <b class="quote">your offspring will be traced**[^f] <b class="quote">through Isaac.**[^g] 









###### 8 




That is, it is not the children by physical descent[^h] who are God's children, but the children of the promise are considered to be the offspring. 









###### 9 




For this is the statement of the promise: <b class="quote">At this time I will come, and Sarah will have a son.**[^i] 









###### 10 




And not only that, but Rebekah conceived children through one man, our father Isaac. 









###### 11 




For though her sons had not been born yet or done anything good or bad, so that God's purpose according to election might stand-- 









###### 12 




not from works but from the one who calls--she was told, <b class="quote">The older will serve the younger.**[^j] 









###### 13 




As it is written: <b class="quote">I have loved Jacob, but I have hated Esau.**[^k] ## God's Selection Is Just 









###### 14 




What should we say then? Is there injustice with God? Absolutely not! 









###### 15 




For he tells Moses, <b class="quote">I will show mercy to whom I will show mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.**[^l] 









###### 16 




So then, it does not depend on human will or effort but on God who shows mercy. 









###### 17 




For the Scripture tells Pharaoh, <b class="quote">I raised you up for this reason so that I may display my power in you and that my name may be proclaimed in the whole earth.**[^m] 









###### 18 




So then, he has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy and he hardens whom he wants to harden. 









###### 19 




You will say to me, therefore, "Why then does he still find fault? For who resists his will?" 









###### 20 




On the contrary, who are you, a human being, to talk back to God? Will what is formed say to the one who formed it, "Why did you make me like this?" 









###### 21 




Or has the potter no right over the clay, to make from the same lump one piece of pottery for honor and another for dishonor? 









###### 22 




And what if God, wanting to display his wrath and to make his power known, endured with much patience objects of wrath prepared for destruction? 









###### 23 




And what if he did this to make known the riches of his glory on objects of mercy that he prepared beforehand for glory-- 









###### 24 




on us, the ones he also called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles? 









###### 25 




As it[^n] also says in Hosea, <b class="quote">I will call Not My People, My People,** <b class="quote">and she who is Unloved, Beloved.**[^o] 









###### 26 




<b class="quote">And it will be in the place where they were told,** <b class="quote">you are not my people,** <b class="quote">there they will be called sons of the living God.**[^p] 









###### 27 




But Isaiah cries out concerning Israel, <b class="quote">Though the number of Israelites** <b class="quote">is like the sand of the sea,** <b class="quote">only the remnant will be saved;** 









###### 28 




<b class="quote">since the Lord will execute his sentence** <b class="quote">completely and decisively on the earth.**[^q][^r] 









###### 29 




And just as Isaiah predicted: <b class="quote">If the Lord of Armies had not left us offspring,** <b class="quote">we would have become like Sodom,** <b class="quote">and we would have been made like Gomorrah.**[^s] ## Israel's Present State 









###### 30 




What should we say then? Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have obtained righteousness--namely the righteousness that comes from faith. 









###### 31 




But Israel, pursuing the law of righteousness, has not achieved the righteousness of the law.[^t] 









###### 32 




Why is that? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as if it were by works.[^u] They stumbled over the stumbling stone. 









###### 33 




As it is written, <b class="quote">Look, I am putting a stone in Zion to stumble over** <b class="quote">and a rock to trip over,** <b class="quote">and the one who believes on him** <b class="quote">will not be put to shame.**[^v] ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Song of Solomon 1

***










###### 1 




The Song of Songs, which is Solomon's. 









###### 2 




Oh, that he would kiss me with the kisses of his mouth! For your caresses[^a] are more delightful than wine. 









###### 3 




The fragrance of your perfume is intoxicating; your name is perfume poured out. No wonder young women[^b] adore you. 









###### 4 




Take me with you--let's hurry. Oh, that the king would bring[^c] me to his chambers. We will rejoice and be glad in you; we will celebrate your caresses more than wine. It is only right that they adore you. 









###### 5 




Daughters of Jerusalem, I am dark like the tents of Kedar, yet lovely like the curtains of Solomon. 









###### 6 




Do not stare at me because I am dark, for the sun has gazed on me. My mother's sons were angry with me; they made me take care of the vineyards. I have not taken care of my own vineyard. 









###### 7 




Tell me, you whom I love: Where do you pasture your sheep? Where do you let them rest at noon? Why should I be like one who veils herself[^d] beside the flocks of your companions? 









###### 8 




[^e]If you do not know, most beautiful of women, follow[^f] the tracks of the flock, and pasture your young goats near the shepherds' tents. 









###### 9 




I compare you, my darling, to a[^g] mare among Pharaoh's chariots. 









###### 10 




Your cheeks are beautiful with jewelry, your neck with its necklace. 









###### 11 




We will make gold jewelry for you, accented with silver. 









###### 12 




While the king is on his couch,[^h] my perfume[^i] releases its fragrance. 









###### 13 




The one I love is a sachet of myrrh to me, spending the night between my breasts. 









###### 14 




The one I love is a cluster of henna blossoms to me, in the vineyards of En-gedi. 









###### 15 




How beautiful you are, my darling. How very beautiful! Your eyes are doves. 









###### 16 




How handsome you are, my love. How delightful! Our bed is verdant; 









###### 17

# Song of Solomon 2

***










###### 1 




I am a wildflower[^a] of Sharon, a lily[^b] of the valleys. 









###### 2 




Like a lily among thorns, so is my darling among the young women. 









###### 3 




Like an apricot[^c] tree among the trees of the forest, so is my love among the young men. I delight to sit in his shade, and his fruit is sweet to my taste. 









###### 4 




He brought me to the banquet hall,[^d] and he looked on me with love.[^e] 









###### 5 




Sustain me with raisins; refresh me with apricots,[^f] for I am lovesick. 









###### 6 




May his left hand be under my head, and his right arm embrace me. 









###### 7 




Young women of Jerusalem, I charge you by the gazelles and the wild does of the field, do not stir up or awaken love until the appropriate time.[^g] 









###### 8 




Listen! My love is approaching. Look! Here he comes, leaping over the mountains, bounding over the hills. 









###### 9 




My love is like a gazelle or a young stag. See, he is standing behind our wall, gazing through the windows, peering through the lattice. 









###### 10 




My love calls to me: Arise, my darling. Come away, my beautiful one. 









###### 11 




For now the winter is past; the rain has ended and gone away. 









###### 12 




The blossoms appear in the countryside. The time of singing[^h] has come, and the turtledove's cooing is heard in our land. 









###### 13 




The fig tree ripens its figs; the blossoming vines give off their fragrance. Arise, my darling. Come away, my beautiful one. 









###### 14 




My dove, in the clefts of the rock, in the crevices of the cliff, let me see your face,[^i] let me hear your voice; for your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely. 









###### 15 




[^j]Catch the foxes for us-- the little foxes that ruin the vineyards-- for our vineyards are in bloom. 









###### 16 




My love is mine and I am his; he feeds among the lilies. 









###### 17 




Until the day breaks[^k] and the shadows flee, turn around, my love, and be like a gazelle or a young stag on the divided mountains.[^l] ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

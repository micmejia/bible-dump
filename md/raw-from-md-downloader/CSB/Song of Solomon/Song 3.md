# Song of Solomon 3

***










###### 1 




In my bed at night[^a] I sought the one I love; I sought him, but did not find him.[^b] 









###### 2 




I will arise now and go about the city, through the streets and the plazas. I will seek the one I love. I sought him, but did not find him. 









###### 3 




The guards who go about the city found me. I asked them, "Have you seen the one I love?" 









###### 4 




I had just passed them when I found the one I love. I held on to him and would not let him go until I brought him to my mother's house-- to the chamber of the one who conceived me. 









###### 5 




Young women of Jerusalem, I charge you by the gazelles and the wild does of the field, do not stir up or awaken love until the appropriate time.[^c] 









###### 6 




Who is this coming up from the wilderness like columns of smoke, scented with myrrh and frankincense from every fragrant powder of the merchant? 









###### 7 




Look! Solomon's bed surrounded by sixty warriors from the mighty men of Israel. 









###### 8 




All of them are skilled with swords and trained in warfare. Each has his sword at his side to guard against the terror of the night. 









###### 9 




King Solomon made a carriage for himself with wood from Lebanon. 









###### 10 




He made its posts of silver, its back[^d] of gold, and its seat of purple. Its interior is inlaid with love[^e] by the young women of Jerusalem. 









###### 11 




Go out, young women of Zion, and gaze at King Solomon, wearing the crown his mother placed on him on the day of his wedding-- the day of his heart's rejoicing. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

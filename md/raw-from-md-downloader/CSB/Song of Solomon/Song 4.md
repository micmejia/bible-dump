# Song of Solomon 4

***










###### 1 




How beautiful you are, my darling. How very beautiful! Behind your veil, your eyes are doves. Your hair is like a flock of goats streaming down Mount Gilead. 









###### 2 




Your teeth are like a flock of newly shorn sheep coming up from washing, each one bearing twins, and none has lost its young.[^a] 









###### 3 




Your lips are like a scarlet cord, and your mouth[^b] is lovely. Behind your veil, your brow[^c] is like a slice of pomegranate. 









###### 4 




Your neck is like the tower of David, constructed in layers. A thousand shields are hung on it-- all of them shields of warriors. 









###### 5 




Your breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle, that feed among the lilies. 









###### 6 




Until the day breaks[^d] and the shadows flee, I will make my way to the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense. 









###### 7 




You are absolutely beautiful, my darling; there is no imperfection in you. 









###### 8 




Come with me from Lebanon,[^e] my bride; come with me from Lebanon! Descend from the peak of Amana, from the summit of Senir and Hermon, from the dens of the lions, from the mountains of the leopards. 









###### 9 




You have captured my heart, my sister, my bride. You have captured my heart with one glance of your eyes, with one jewel of your necklace. 









###### 10 




How delightful your caresses are, my sister, my bride. Your caresses are much better than wine, and the fragrance of your perfume than any balsam. 









###### 11 




Your lips drip sweetness like the honeycomb, my bride. Honey and milk are under your tongue. The fragrance of your garments is like the fragrance of Lebanon. 









###### 12 




My sister, my bride, you are a locked garden-- a locked garden[^f] and a sealed spring. 









###### 13 




Your branches are a paradise[^g] of pomegranates with choicest fruits; henna with nard, 









###### 14 




nard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon, with all the trees of frankincense, myrrh and aloes, with all the best spices. 









###### 15 




You are a garden spring, a well of flowing water streaming from Lebanon. 









###### 16 




Awaken, north wind; come, south wind. Blow on my garden, and spread the fragrance of its spices. Let my love come to his garden and eat its choicest fruits. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

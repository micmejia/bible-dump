# Song of Solomon 5

***










###### 1 




I have come to my garden--my sister, my bride. I gather[^a] my myrrh with my spices. I eat my honeycomb with my honey. I drink my wine with my milk. Eat, friends! Drink, be intoxicated with caresses![^b] 









###### 2 




I was sleeping, but my heart was awake. A sound! My love was knocking! Open to me, my sister, my darling, my dove, my perfect one. For my head is drenched with dew, my hair with droplets of the night. 









###### 3 




I have taken off my clothing. How can I put it back on? I have washed my feet. How can I get them dirty? 









###### 4 




My love thrust his hand through the opening, and my feelings were stirred for him. 









###### 5 




I rose to open for my love. My hands dripped with myrrh, my fingers with flowing myrrh on the handles of the bolt. 









###### 6 




I opened to my love, but my love had turned and gone away. My heart sank[^c] because he had left.[^d] I sought him, but did not find him. I called him, but he did not answer. 









###### 7 




The guards who go about the city found me. They beat and wounded me; they took my cloak[^e] from me-- the guardians of the walls. 









###### 8 




Young women of Jerusalem, I charge you, if you find my love, tell him that I am lovesick. 









###### 9 




What makes the one you love better than another, most beautiful of women? What makes him better than another, that you would give us this charge? 









###### 10 




My love is fit and strong,[^f] notable among ten thousand. 









###### 11 




His head is purest gold. His hair is wavy[^g] and black as a raven. 









###### 12 




His eyes are like doves beside flowing streams, washed in milk and set like jewels.[^h] 









###### 13 




His cheeks are like beds of spice, mounds of[^i] perfume. His lips are lilies, dripping with flowing myrrh. 









###### 14 




His arms[^j] are rods of gold set[^k] with beryl. His body[^l] is an ivory panel covered with lapis lazuli. 









###### 15 




His legs are alabaster pillars set on pedestals of pure gold. His presence is like Lebanon, as majestic as the cedars. 









###### 16 




His mouth is sweetness. He is absolutely desirable. This is my love, and this is my friend, young women of Jerusalem. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Song of Solomon 6

***










###### 1 




Where has your love gone, most beautiful of women? Which way has he[^a] turned? We will seek him with you. 









###### 2 




My love has gone down to his garden, to beds of spice, to feed in the gardens and gather lilies. 









###### 3 




I am my love's and my love is mine; he feeds among the lilies. 









###### 4 




You are as beautiful as Tirzah, my darling, lovely as Jerusalem, awe-inspiring as an army with banners. 









###### 5 




Turn your eyes away from me, for they captivate me. Your hair is like a flock of goats streaming down from Gilead. 









###### 6 




Your teeth are like a flock of ewes coming up from washing, each one having a twin, and not one missing.[^b] 









###### 7 




Behind your veil, your brow[^c] is like a slice of pomegranate. 









###### 8 




There are sixty queens and eighty concubines and young women[^d] without number. 









###### 9 




But my dove, my virtuous one, is unique; she is the favorite of her mother, perfect to the one who gave her birth. Women see her and declare her fortunate; queens and concubines also, and they sing her praises: 









###### 10 




Who is this who shines like the dawn, as beautiful as the moon, bright as the sun, awe-inspiring as an army with banners? 









###### 11 




I came down to the walnut grove to see the blossoms of the valley, to see if the vines were budding and the pomegranates blooming. 









###### 12 




I didn't know what was happening to me. I felt like I was in a chariot with a nobleman.[^e] 









###### 13 




Come back, come back, Shulammite![^f] Come back, come back, that we may look at you!

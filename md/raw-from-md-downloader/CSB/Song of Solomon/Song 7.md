# Song of Solomon 7

***










###### 1 




How beautiful are your sandaled feet, princess![^a] The curves of your thighs are like jewelry, the handiwork of a master. 









###### 2 




Your navel is a rounded bowl; it never lacks mixed wine. Your belly is a mound of wheat surrounded by lilies. 









###### 3 




Your breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle. 









###### 4 




Your neck is like a tower of ivory, your eyes like pools in Heshbon by Bath-rabbim's gate. Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon looking toward Damascus. 









###### 5 




Your head crowns you[^b] like Mount Carmel, the hair of your head like purple cloth-- a king could be held captive in your tresses. 









###### 6 




How beautiful you are and how pleasant, my love, with such delights! 









###### 7 




Your stature is like a palm tree; your breasts are clusters of fruit. 









###### 8 




I said, "I will climb the palm tree and take hold of its fruit." May your breasts be like clusters of grapes, and the fragrance of your breath like apricots. 









###### 9 




Your mouth[^c] is like fine wine-- flowing smoothly for my love, gliding past my lips and teeth![^d] 









###### 10 




I am my love's, and his desire is for me. 









###### 11 




Come, my love, let's go to the field; let's spend the night among the henna blossoms.[^e] 









###### 12 




Let's go early to the vineyards; let's see if the vine has budded, if the blossom has opened, if the pomegranates are in bloom. There I will give you my caresses. 









###### 13 




The mandrakes give off a fragrance, and at our doors is every delicacy, both new and old. I have treasured them up for you, my love. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

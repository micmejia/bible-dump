# Song of Solomon 8

***










###### 1 




If only I could treat you like my brother,[^a] one who nursed at my mother's breasts, I would find you in public and kiss you, and no one would scorn me. 









###### 2 




I would lead you, I would take you, to the house of my mother who taught me.[^b] I would give you spiced wine to drink from the juice of my pomegranate. 









###### 3 




May his left hand be under my head, and his right arm embrace me. 









###### 4 




Young women of Jerusalem, I charge you, do not stir up or awaken love until the appropriate time. 









###### 5 




Who is this coming up from the wilderness, leaning on the one she loves? I awakened you under the apricot tree. There your mother conceived you; there she conceived and gave you birth. 









###### 6 




Set me as a seal on your heart, as a seal on your arm. For love is as strong as death; jealousy is as unrelenting as Sheol. Love's flames are fiery flames-- an almighty flame![^c] 









###### 7 




A huge torrent cannot extinguish love; rivers cannot sweep it away. If a man were to give all his wealth[^d] for love, it would be utterly scorned. 









###### 8 




Our sister is young; she has no breasts. What will we do for our sister on the day she is spoken for? 









###### 9 




If she is a wall, we will build a silver barricade on her. If she is a door, we will enclose her with cedar planks. 









###### 10 




I am[^e] a wall and my breasts like towers. So to him I have become like one who finds[^f] peace.[^g] 









###### 11 




Solomon owned a vineyard in Baal-hamon. He leased the vineyard to tenants. Each was to bring for his fruit one thousand pieces of silver. 









###### 12 




I have my own vineyard.[^h] The one thousand are for you, Solomon, but two hundred for those who take care of its fruits. 









###### 13 




You[^i] who dwell in the gardens, companions are listening for your voice; let me hear you! 









###### 14 




Run away with me,[^j] my love, and be like a gazelle or a young stag on the mountains of spices. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Titus 1

***










###### 1 




Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, for[^a] the faith of God's elect and their knowledge of the truth that leads[^b] to godliness, 









###### 2 




in the hope of eternal life that God, who cannot lie, promised before time began. 









###### 3 




In his own time he has revealed his word in the preaching with which I was entrusted by the command of God our Savior: 









###### 4 




To Titus, my true son in our common faith. Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior. ## Titus's Ministry in Crete 









###### 5 




The reason I left you in Crete was to set right what was left undone and, as I directed you, to appoint elders in every town. 









###### 6 




An elder must be blameless, the husband of one wife, with faithful[^c] children who are not accused of wildness or rebellion. 









###### 7 




As an overseer of God's household, he must be blameless, not arrogant, not hot-tempered, not an excessive drinker, not a bully, not greedy for money, 









###### 8 




but hospitable, loving what is good, sensible, righteous, holy, self-controlled, 









###### 9 




holding to the faithful message as taught, so that he will be able both to encourage with sound teaching and to refute those who contradict it. 









###### 10 




For there are many rebellious people, full of empty talk and deception, especially those from the circumcision party. 









###### 11 




It is necessary to silence them; they are ruining entire households by teaching what they shouldn't in order to get money dishonestly. 









###### 12 




One of their very own prophets said, "Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons." 









###### 13 




This testimony is true. For this reason, rebuke them sharply, so that they may be sound in the faith 









###### 14 




and may not pay attention to Jewish myths and the commands of people who reject the truth. 









###### 15 




To the pure, everything is pure, but to those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure; in fact, both their mind and conscience are defiled. 









###### 16 




They claim to know God, but they deny him by their works. They are detestable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

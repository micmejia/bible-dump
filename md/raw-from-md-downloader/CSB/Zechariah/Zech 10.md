# Zechariah 10

***










###### 1 




Ask the Lord for rain in the season of spring rain. The Lord makes the rain clouds, and he will give them showers of rain and crops in the field for everyone. 









###### 2 




For the idols speak falsehood, and the diviners see illusions; they relate empty dreams and offer empty comfort. Therefore the people wander like sheep; they suffer affliction because there is no shepherd. 









###### 3 




My anger burns against the shepherds, so I will punish the leaders.[^a] For the Lord of Armies has tended his flock, the house of Judah; he will make them like his majestic steed in battle. 









###### 4 




The cornerstone, the tent peg, the battle bow, and every ruler-- all will go out from him together. 









###### 5 




They will be like warriors in battle trampling down the mud of the streets. They will fight because the Lord is with them, and they will put horsemen to shame. 









###### 6 




I will strengthen the house of Judah and deliver the house of Joseph.[^b] I will restore[^c] them because I have compassion on them, and they will be as though I had never rejected them. For I am the Lord their God, and I will answer them. 









###### 7 




Ephraim will be like a warrior, and their hearts will be glad as if with wine. Their children will see it and be glad; their hearts will rejoice in the Lord. 









###### 8 




I will whistle and gather them because I have redeemed them; they will be as numerous as they once were. 









###### 9 




Though I sow them among the nations, they will remember me in the distant lands; they and their children will live and return. 









###### 10 




I will bring them back from the land of Egypt and gather them from Assyria. I will bring them to the land of Gilead and to Lebanon, but it will not be enough for them. 









###### 11 




The Lord[^d] will pass through the sea of distress and strike the waves of the sea; all the depths of the Nile will dry up. The pride of Assyria will be brought down, and the scepter of Egypt will come to an end. 









###### 12 




I will strengthen them in the Lord, and they will march in his name-- this is the Lord's declaration. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Zechariah 11

***










###### 1 




Open your gates, Lebanon, and fire will consume your cedars. 









###### 2 




Wail, cypress, for the cedar has fallen; the glorious trees are destroyed! Wail, oaks of Bashan, for the stately forest has fallen! 









###### 3 




Listen to the wail of the shepherds, for their glory is destroyed. Listen to the roar of young lions, for the thickets of the Jordan are[^a] destroyed. 









###### 4 




The Lord my God says this: "Shepherd the flock intended for slaughter. 









###### 5 




Those who buy them slaughter them but are not punished. Those who sell them say, 'Blessed be the Lord because I have become rich!' Even their own shepherds have no compassion for them. 









###### 6 




Indeed, I will no longer have compassion on the inhabitants of the land"--this is the Lord's declaration. "Instead, I will turn everyone over to his neighbor and his king. They will devastate the land, and I will not rescue it from their hand." 









###### 7 




So I shepherded the flock intended for slaughter, the oppressed of the flock.[^b] I took two staffs, calling one Favor and the other Union, and I shepherded the flock. 









###### 8 




In one month I got rid of three shepherds. I became impatient with them, and they also detested me. 









###### 9 




Then I said, "I will no longer shepherd you. Let what is dying die, and let what is perishing perish; let the rest devour each other's flesh." 









###### 10 




Next I took my staff called Favor and cut it in two, annulling the covenant I had made with all the peoples. 









###### 11 




It was annulled on that day, and so the oppressed of the flock[^c] who were watching me knew that it was the word of the Lord. 









###### 12 




Then I said to them, "If it seems right to you, give me my wages; but if not, keep them." So they weighed my wages, thirty pieces of silver. 









###### 13 




"Throw it to the potter,"[^d] the Lord said to me--this magnificent price I was valued by them. So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw it into the house of the Lord, to the potter.[^e] 









###### 14 




Then I cut in two my second staff, Union, annulling the brotherhood between Judah and Israel. 









###### 15 




The Lord also said to me, "Take the equipment of a foolish shepherd. 









###### 16 




I am about to raise up a shepherd in the land who will not care for those who are perishing, and he will not seek the lost[^f] or heal the broken. He will not sustain the healthy,[^g] but he will devour the flesh of the fat sheep and tear off their hooves. 









###### 17 




Woe to the worthless shepherd who deserts the flock! May a sword strike[^h] his arm and his right eye! May his arm wither away and his right eye go completely blind!" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Zechariah 13

***










###### 1 




"On that day a fountain will be opened for the house of David and for the residents of Jerusalem, to wash away sin and impurity. 









###### 2 




On that day"--this is the declaration of the Lord of Armies--"I will remove the names of the idols from the land, and they will no longer be remembered. I will banish the prophets[^a] and the unclean spirit from the land. 









###### 3 




If a man still prophesies, his father and his mother who bore him will say to him, 'You cannot remain alive because you have spoken a lie in the name of the Lord.' When he prophesies, his father and his mother who bore him will pierce him through. 









###### 4 




On that day every prophet will be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies; they will not put on a hairy cloak in order to deceive. 









###### 5 




He will say, 'I am not a prophet; I work the land, for a man purchased[^b] me as a servant since my youth.' 









###### 6 




If someone asks him, 'What are these wounds on your chest?'[^c]--then he will answer, 'I received the wounds in the house of my friends.' 









###### 7 




Sword, awake against my shepherd, against the man who is my associate-- this is the declaration of the Lord of Armies. Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered; I will turn my hand against the little ones. 









###### 8 




In the whole land-- this is the Lord's declaration-- two-thirds[^d] will be cut off and die, but a third will be left in it. 









###### 9 




I will put this third through the fire; I will refine them as silver is refined and test them as gold is tested. They will call on my name, and I will answer them. I will say, 'They are my people,' and they will say, 'The Lord is our God.'" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

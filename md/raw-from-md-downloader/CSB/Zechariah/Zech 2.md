# Zechariah 2

***










###### 1 




I looked up and saw a man with a measuring line in his hand. 









###### 2 




I asked, "Where are you going?" He answered me, "To measure Jerusalem to determine its width and length." 









###### 3 




Then the angel who was speaking with me went out, and another angel went out to meet him. 









###### 4 




He said to him, "Run and tell this young man: Jerusalem will be inhabited without walls because of the number of people and animals in it." 









###### 5 




The declaration of the Lord: "I myself will be a wall of fire around it, and I will be the glory within it." 









###### 6 




"Listen! Listen! Flee from the land of the north"--this is the Lord's declaration--"for I have scattered you like the four winds of heaven"--this is the Lord's declaration. 









###### 7 




"Listen, Zion! Escape, you who are living with Daughter Babylon." 









###### 8 




For the Lord of Armies says this: "In pursuit of his glory, he sent me against the nations plundering you, for whoever touches you touches the pupil[^a] of my[^b] eye. 









###### 9 




For look, I am raising my hand against them, and they will become plunder for their own servants. Then you will know that the Lord of Armies has sent me. 









###### 10 




"Daughter Zion, shout for joy and be glad, for I am coming to dwell among you"--this is the Lord's declaration. 









###### 11 




"Many nations will join themselves to the Lord on that day and become my[^c] people. I will dwell among you, and you will know that the Lord of Armies has sent me to you. 









###### 12 




The Lord will take possession of Judah as his portion in the Holy Land, and he will once again choose Jerusalem. 









###### 13 




Let all humanity be silent before the Lord, for from his holy dwelling he has roused himself." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

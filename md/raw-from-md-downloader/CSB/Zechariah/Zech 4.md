# Zechariah 4

***










###### 1 




The angel who was speaking with me then returned and roused me as one awakened out of sleep. 









###### 2 




He asked me, "What do you see?" I replied, "I see a solid gold lampstand with a bowl at the top. The lampstand also has seven lamps at the top with seven spouts for each of[^a] the lamps. 









###### 3 




There are also two olive trees beside it, one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left." 









###### 4 




Then I asked the angel who was speaking with me, "What are these, my lord?" 









###### 5 




"Don't you know what they are?" replied the angel who was speaking with me. I said, "No, my lord." 









###### 6 




So he answered me, "This is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel: 'Not by strength or by might, but by my Spirit,' says the Lord of Armies. 









###### 7 




'What are you, great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain. And he will bring out the capstone accompanied by shouts of: Grace, grace to it!'" 









###### 8 




Then the word of the Lord came to me: 









###### 9 




"Zerubbabel's hands have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands will complete it. Then you will know that the Lord of Armies has sent me to you. 









###### 10 




For who despises the day of small things? These seven eyes of the Lord, which scan throughout the whole earth, will rejoice when they see the ceremonial stone[^b] in Zerubbabel's hand." 









###### 11 




I asked him, "What are the two olive trees on the right and left of the lampstand?" 









###### 12 




And I questioned him further, "What are the two streams[^c] of the olive trees, from which the golden oil is pouring through the two golden conduits?" 









###### 13 




Then he inquired of me, "Don't you know what these are?" "No, my lord," I replied. 









###### 14 




"These are the two anointed ones,"[^d] he said, "who stand by the Lord of the whole earth." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

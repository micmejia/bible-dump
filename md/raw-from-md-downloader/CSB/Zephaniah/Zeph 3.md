# Zephaniah 3

***










###### 1 




Woe to the city that is rebellious[^a] and defiled, the oppressive city! 









###### 2 




She has not obeyed; she has not accepted discipline. She has not trusted in the Lord; she has not drawn near to her God. 









###### 3 




The[^b] princes within her are roaring lions; her judges are wolves of the night, which leave nothing for[^c] the morning. 









###### 4 




Her prophets are reckless-- treacherous men. Her priests profane the sanctuary; they do violence to instruction. 









###### 5 




The righteous Lord is in her; he does no wrong. He applies his justice morning by morning; he does not fail at dawn, yet the one who does wrong knows no shame. 









###### 6 




I have cut off nations; their corner towers are destroyed. I have laid waste their streets, with no one to pass through. Their cities lie devastated, without a person, without an inhabitant. 









###### 7 




I said: You will certainly fear me and accept correction. Then her dwelling place[^d] would not be cut off based on all that I had allocated to her. However, they became more corrupt in all their actions. 









###### 8 




Therefore, wait for me-- this is the Lord's declaration-- until the day I rise up for plunder.[^e] For my decision is to gather nations, to assemble kingdoms, in order to pour out my indignation on them, all my burning anger; for the whole earth will be consumed by the fire of my jealousy. ## Final Restoration Promised 









###### 9 




For I will then restore pure speech to the peoples so that all of them may call on the name of the Lord and serve him with a single purpose.[^f] 









###### 10 




From beyond the rivers of Cush my supplicants, my dispersed people, will bring an offering to me. 









###### 11 




On that day you[^g] will not be put to shame because of everything you have done in rebelling against me. For then I will remove from among you your jubilant, arrogant people, and you will never again be haughty on my holy mountain. 









###### 12 




I will leave a meek and humble people among you, and they will take refuge in the name of the Lord. 









###### 13 




The remnant of Israel will no longer do wrong or tell lies; a deceitful tongue will not be found in their mouths. They will pasture and lie down, with nothing to make them afraid. 









###### 14 




Sing for joy, Daughter Zion; shout loudly, Israel! Be glad and celebrate with all your heart, Daughter Jerusalem! 









###### 15 




The Lord has removed your punishment; he has turned back your enemy. The King of Israel, the Lord, is among you; you need no longer fear harm. 









###### 16 




On that day it will be said to Jerusalem: "Do not fear; Zion, do not let your hands grow weak. 









###### 17 




The Lord your God is among you, a warrior who saves. He will rejoice over you with gladness. He will be quiet[^h] in his love. He will delight in you with singing." 









###### 18 




I will gather those who have been driven from the appointed festivals; they will be a tribute from you[^i] and a reproach on her.[^j] 









###### 19 




Yes, at that time I will deal with all who oppress you. I will save the lame and gather the outcasts; I will make those who were disgraced throughout the earth receive praise and fame. 









###### 20 




At that time I will bring you[^k] back, yes, at the time I will gather you. I will give you fame and praise among all the peoples of the earth, when I restore your fortunes before your eyes.

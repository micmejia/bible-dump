# 1 Timothy 3

***






###### 1 


The saying is trustworthy: If anyone aspires to the office of overseer, he desires a noble task. 





###### 2 


Therefore an overseer[^a] must be above reproach, the husband of one wife,[^b] sober-minded, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, 





###### 3 


not a drunkard, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money. 





###### 4 


He must manage his own household well, with all dignity keeping his children submissive, 





###### 5 


for if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he care for God's church? 





###### 6 


He must not be a recent convert, or he may become puffed up with conceit and fall into the condemnation of the devil. 





###### 7 


Moreover, he must be well thought of by outsiders, so that he may not fall into disgrace, into a snare of the devil. ## Qualifications for Deacons 





###### 8 


Deacons likewise must be dignified, not double-tongued,[^c] not addicted to much wine, not greedy for dishonest gain. 





###### 9 


They must hold the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience. 





###### 10 


And let them also be tested first; then let them serve as deacons if they prove themselves blameless. 





###### 11 


Their wives likewise[^d] must be dignified, not slanderers, but sober-minded, faithful in all things. 





###### 12 


Let deacons each be the husband of one wife, managing their children and their own households well. 





###### 13 


For those who serve well as deacons gain a good standing for themselves and also great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus. ## The Mystery of Godliness 





###### 14 


I hope to come to you soon, but I am writing these things to you so that, 





###### 15 


if I delay, you may know how one ought to behave in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, a pillar and buttress of the truth. 





###### 16 


Great indeed, we confess, is the mystery of godliness: He[^e] was manifested in the flesh, vindicated[^f] by the Spirit,[^g] seen by angels, proclaimed among the nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

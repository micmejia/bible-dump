# 1 Timothy 4

***






###### 1 


Now the Spirit expressly says that in later times some will depart from the faith by devoting themselves to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons, 





###### 2 


through the insincerity of liars whose consciences are seared, 





###### 3 


who forbid marriage and require abstinence from foods that God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth. 





###### 4 


For everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving, 





###### 5 


for it is made holy by the word of God and prayer. ## A Good Servant of Christ Jesus 





###### 6 


If you put these things before the brothers,[^a] you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, being trained in the words of the faith and of the good doctrine that you have followed. 





###### 7 


Have nothing to do with irreverent, silly myths. Rather train yourself for godliness; 





###### 8 


for while bodily training is of some value, godliness is of value in every way, as it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come. 





###### 9 


The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance. 





###### 10 


For to this end we toil and strive,[^b] because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the Savior of all people, especially of those who believe. 





###### 11 


Command and teach these things. 





###### 12 


Let no one despise you for your youth, but set the believers an example in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity. 





###### 13 


Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to exhortation, to teaching. 





###### 14 


Do not neglect the gift you have, which was given you by prophecy when the council of elders laid their hands on you. 





###### 15 


Practice these things, immerse yourself in them,[^c] so that all may see your progress. 





###### 16 


Keep a close watch on yourself and on the teaching. Persist in this, for by so doing you will save both yourself and your hearers. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

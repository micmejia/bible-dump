# Ezekiel 4

***






###### 1 


"And you, son of man, take a brick and lay it before you, and engrave on it a city, even Jerusalem. 





###### 2 


And put siegeworks against it, and build a siege wall against it, and cast up a mound against it. Set camps also against it, and plant battering rams against it all around. 





###### 3 


And you, take an iron griddle, and place it as an iron wall between you and the city; and set your face toward it, and let it be in a state of siege, and press the siege against it. This is a sign for the house of Israel. 





###### 4 


"Then lie on your left side, and place the punishment[^a] of the house of Israel upon it. For the number of the days that you lie on it, you shall bear their punishment. 





###### 5 


For I assign to you a number of days, 390 days, equal to the number of the years of their punishment. So long shall you bear the punishment of the house of Israel. 





###### 6 


And when you have completed these, you shall lie down a second time, but on your right side, and bear the punishment of the house of Judah. Forty days I assign you, a day for each year. 





###### 7 


And you shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem, with your arm bared, and you shall prophesy against the city. 





###### 8 


And behold, I will place cords upon you, so that you cannot turn from one side to the other, till you have completed the days of your siege. 





###### 9 


"And you, take wheat and barley, beans and lentils, millet and emmer,[^b] and put them into a single vessel and make your bread from them. During the number of days that you lie on your side, 390 days, you shall eat it. 





###### 10 


And your food that you eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels[^c] a day; from day to day[^d] you shall eat it. 





###### 11 


And water you shall drink by measure, the sixth part of a hin;[^e] from day to day you shall drink. 





###### 12 


And you shall eat it as a barley cake, baking it in their sight on human dung." 





###### 13 


And the LORD said, "Thus shall the people of Israel eat their bread unclean, among the nations where I will drive them." 





###### 14 


Then I said, "Ah, Lord God! Behold, I have never defiled myself.[^f] From my youth up till now I have never eaten what died of itself or was torn by beasts, nor has tainted meat come into my mouth." 





###### 15 


Then he said to me, "See, I assign to you cow's dung instead of human dung, on which you may prepare your bread." 





###### 16 


Moreover, he said to me, "Son of man, behold, I will break the supply[^g] of bread in Jerusalem. They shall eat bread by weight and with anxiety, and they shall drink water by measure and in dismay. 





###### 17 


I will do this that they may lack bread and water, and look at one another in dismay, and rot away because of their punishment. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

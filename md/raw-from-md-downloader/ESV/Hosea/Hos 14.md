# Hosea 14

***






###### 1 


Return, O Israel, to the LORD your God, for you have stumbled because of your iniquity. 





###### 2 


Take with you words and return to the LORD; say to him, "Take away all iniquity; accept what is good, and we will pay with bulls the vows[^a] of our lips. 





###### 3 


Assyria shall not save us; we will not ride on horses; and we will say no more, 'Our God,' to the work of our hands. In you the orphan finds mercy." 





###### 4 


I will heal their apostasy; I will love them freely, for my anger has turned from them. 





###### 5 


I will be like the dew to Israel; he shall blossom like the lily; he shall take root like the trees of Lebanon; 





###### 6 


his shoots shall spread out; his beauty shall be like the olive, and his fragrance like Lebanon. 





###### 7 


They shall return and dwell beneath my[^b] shadow; they shall flourish like the grain; they shall blossom like the vine; their fame shall be like the wine of Lebanon. 





###### 8 


O Ephraim, what have I to do with idols? It is I who answer and look after you.[^c] I am like an evergreen cypress; from me comes your fruit. 





###### 9 


Whoever is wise, let him understand these things; whoever is discerning, let him know them; for the ways of the LORD are right, and the upright walk in them, but transgressors stumble in them. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

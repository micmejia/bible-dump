# Isaiah 3

***






###### 1 


For behold, the Lord God of hosts is taking away from Jerusalem and from Judah support and supply,[^a] all support of bread, and all support of water; 





###### 2 


the mighty man and the soldier, the judge and the prophet, the diviner and the elder, 





###### 3 


the captain of fifty and the man of rank, the counselor and the skillful magician and the expert in charms. 





###### 4 


And I will make boys their princes, and infants[^b] shall rule over them. 





###### 5 


And the people will oppress one another, every one his fellow and every one his neighbor; the youth will be insolent to the elder, and the despised to the honorable. 





###### 6 


For a man will take hold of his brother in the house of his father, saying: "You have a cloak; you shall be our leader, and this heap of ruins shall be under your rule"; 





###### 7 


in that day he will speak out, saying: "I will not be a healer;[^c] in my house there is neither bread nor cloak; you shall not make me leader of the people." 





###### 8 


For Jerusalem has stumbled, and Judah has fallen, because their speech and their deeds are against the LORD, defying his glorious presence.[^d] 





###### 9 


For the look on their faces bears witness against them; they proclaim their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it. Woe to them! For they have brought evil on themselves. 





###### 10 


Tell the righteous that it shall be well with them, for they shall eat the fruit of their deeds. 





###### 11 


Woe to the wicked! It shall be ill with him, for what his hands have dealt out shall be done to him. 





###### 12 


My people--infants are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, your guides mislead you and they have swallowed up[^e] the course of your paths. 





###### 13 


The LORD has taken his place to contend; he stands to judge peoples. 





###### 14 


The LORD will enter into judgment with the elders and princes of his people: "It is you who have devoured[^f] the vineyard, the spoil of the poor is in your houses. 





###### 15 


What do you mean by crushing my people, by grinding the face of the poor?" declares the Lord God of hosts. 





###### 16 


The LORD said: Because the daughters of Zion are haughty and walk with outstretched necks, glancing wantonly with their eyes, mincing along as they go, tinkling with their feet, 





###### 17 


therefore the Lord will strike with a scab the heads of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will lay bare their secret parts. 





###### 18 


In that day the Lord will take away the finery of the anklets, the headbands, and the crescents; 





###### 19 


the pendants, the bracelets, and the scarves; 





###### 20 


the headdresses, the armlets, the sashes, the perfume boxes, and the amulets; 





###### 21 


the signet rings and nose rings; 





###### 22 


the festal robes, the mantles, the cloaks, and the handbags; 





###### 23 


the mirrors, the linen garments, the turbans, and the veils. 





###### 24 


Instead of perfume there will be rottenness; and instead of a belt, a rope; and instead of well-set hair, baldness; and instead of a rich robe, a skirt of sackcloth; and branding instead of beauty. 





###### 25 


Your men shall fall by the sword and your mighty men in battle. 





###### 26 


And her gates shall lament and mourn; empty, she shall sit on the ground. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

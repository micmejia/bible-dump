# Isaiah 53

***






###### 1 


Who has believed what he has heard from us?[^a] And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed? 





###### 2 


For he grew up before him like a young plant, and like a root out of dry ground; he had no form or majesty that we should look at him, and no beauty that we should desire him. 





###### 3 


He was despised and rejected[^b] by men, a man of sorrows[^c] and acquainted with[^d] grief;[^e] and as one from whom men hide their faces[^f] he was despised, and we esteemed him not. 





###### 4 


Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted. 





###### 5 


But he was pierced for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his wounds we are healed. 





###### 6 


All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned--every one--to his own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all. 





###### 7 


He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he opened not his mouth. 





###### 8 


By oppression and judgment he was taken away; and as for his generation, who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living, stricken for the transgression of my people? 





###### 9 


And they made his grave with the wicked and with a rich man in his death, although he had done no violence, and there was no deceit in his mouth. 





###### 10 


Yet it was the will of the LORD to crush him; he has put him to grief;[^g] when his soul makes[^h] an offering for guilt, he shall see his offspring; he shall prolong his days; the will of the LORD shall prosper in his hand. 





###### 11 


Out of the anguish of his soul he shall see[^i] and be satisfied; by his knowledge shall the righteous one, my servant, make many to be accounted righteous, and he shall bear their iniquities. 





###### 12 


Therefore I will divide him a portion with the many,[^j] and he shall divide the spoil with the strong,[^k] because he poured out his soul to death and was numbered with the transgressors; yet he bore the sin of many, and makes intercession for the transgressors. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

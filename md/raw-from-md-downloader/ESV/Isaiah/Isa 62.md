# Isaiah 62

***






###### 1 


For Zion's sake I will not keep silent, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not be quiet, until her righteousness goes forth as brightness, and her salvation as a burning torch. 





###### 2 


The nations shall see your righteousness, and all the kings your glory, and you shall be called by a new name that the mouth of the LORD will give. 





###### 3 


You shall be a crown of beauty in the hand of the LORD, and a royal diadem in the hand of your God. 





###### 4 


You shall no more be termed Forsaken,[^a] and your land shall no more be termed Desolate,[^b] but you shall be called My Delight Is in Her,[^c] and your land Married;[^d] for the LORD delights in you, and your land shall be married. 





###### 5 


For as a young man marries a young woman, so shall your sons marry you, and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so shall your God rejoice over you. 





###### 6 


On your walls, O Jerusalem, I have set watchmen; all the day and all the night they shall never be silent. You who put the LORD in remembrance, take no rest, 





###### 7 


and give him no rest until he establishes Jerusalem and makes it a praise in the earth. 





###### 8 


The LORD has sworn by his right hand and by his mighty arm: "I will not again give your grain to be food for your enemies, and foreigners shall not drink your wine for which you have labored; 





###### 9 


but those who garner it shall eat it and praise the LORD, and those who gather it shall drink it in the courts of my sanctuary."[^e] 





###### 10 


Go through, go through the gates; prepare the way for the people; build up, build up the highway; clear it of stones; lift up a signal over the peoples. 





###### 11 


Behold, the LORD has proclaimed to the end of the earth: Say to the daughter of Zion, "Behold, your salvation comes; behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him." 





###### 12 


And they shall be called The Holy People, The Redeemed of the LORD; and you shall be called Sought Out, A City Not Forsaken. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Job 23

***






###### 1 


Then Job answered and said: 





###### 2 


"Today also my complaint is bitter;[^a] my hand is heavy on account of my groaning. 





###### 3 


Oh, that I knew where I might find him, that I might come even to his seat! 





###### 4 


I would lay my case before him and fill my mouth with arguments. 





###### 5 


I would know what he would answer me and understand what he would say to me. 





###### 6 


Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power? No; he would pay attention to me. 





###### 7 


There an upright man could argue with him, and I would be acquitted forever by my judge. 





###### 8 


"Behold, I go forward, but he is not there, and backward, but I do not perceive him; 





###### 9 


on the left hand when he is working, I do not behold him; he turns to the right hand, but I do not see him. 





###### 10 


But he knows the way that I take; when he has tried me, I shall come out as gold. 





###### 11 


My foot has held fast to his steps; I have kept his way and have not turned aside. 





###### 12 


I have not departed from the commandment of his lips; I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my portion of food. 





###### 13 


But he is unchangeable,[^b] and who can turn him back? What he desires, that he does. 





###### 14 


For he will complete what he appoints for me, and many such things are in his mind. 





###### 15 


Therefore I am terrified at his presence; when I consider, I am in dread of him. 





###### 16 


God has made my heart faint; the Almighty has terrified me; 





###### 17 


yet I am not silenced because of the darkness, nor because thick darkness covers my face. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Job 26

***






###### 1 


Then Job answered and said: 





###### 2 


"How you have helped him who has no power! How you have saved the arm that has no strength! 





###### 3 


How you have counseled him who has no wisdom, and plentifully declared sound knowledge! 





###### 4 


With whose help have you uttered words, and whose breath has come out from you? 





###### 5 


The dead tremble under the waters and their inhabitants. 





###### 6 


Sheol is naked before God,[^a] and Abaddon has no covering. 





###### 7 


He stretches out the north over the void and hangs the earth on nothing. 





###### 8 


He binds up the waters in his thick clouds, and the cloud is not split open under them. 





###### 9 


He covers the face of the full moon[^b] and spreads over it his cloud. 





###### 10 


He has inscribed a circle on the face of the waters at the boundary between light and darkness. 





###### 11 


The pillars of heaven tremble and are astounded at his rebuke. 





###### 12 


By his power he stilled the sea; by his understanding he shattered Rahab. 





###### 13 


By his wind the heavens were made fair; his hand pierced the fleeing serpent. 





###### 14 


Behold, these are but the outskirts of his ways, and how small a whisper do we hear of him! But the thunder of his power who can understand?" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# John 17

***






###### 1 


When Jesus had spoken these words, he lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, "Father, the hour has come; glorify your Son that the Son may glorify you, 





###### 2 


since you have given him authority over all flesh, to give eternal life to all whom you have given him. 





###### 3 


And this is eternal life, that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent. 





###### 4 


I glorified you on earth, having accomplished the work that you gave me to do. 





###### 5 


And now, Father, glorify me in your own presence with the glory that I had with you before the world existed. 





###### 6 


"I have manifested your name to the people whom you gave me out of the world. Yours they were, and you gave them to me, and they have kept your word. 





###### 7 


Now they know that everything that you have given me is from you. 





###### 8 


For I have given them the words that you gave me, and they have received them and have come to know in truth that I came from you; and they have believed that you sent me. 





###### 9 


I am praying for them. I am not praying for the world but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours. 





###### 10 


All mine are yours, and yours are mine, and I am glorified in them. 





###### 11 


And I am no longer in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them in your name, which you have given me, that they may be one, even as we are one. 





###### 12 


While I was with them, I kept them in your name, which you have given me. I have guarded them, and not one of them has been lost except the son of destruction, that the Scripture might be fulfilled. 





###### 13 


But now I am coming to you, and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves. 





###### 14 


I have given them your word, and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world. 





###### 15 


I do not ask that you take them out of the world, but that you keep them from the evil one.[^a] 





###### 16 


They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world. 





###### 17 


Sanctify them[^b] in the truth; your word is truth. 





###### 18 


As you sent me into the world, so I have sent them into the world. 





###### 19 


And for their sake I consecrate myself,[^c] that they also may be sanctified[^d] in truth. 





###### 20 


"I do not ask for these only, but also for those who will believe in me through their word, 





###### 21 


that they may all be one, just as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be in us, so that the world may believe that you have sent me. 





###### 22 


The glory that you have given me I have given to them, that they may be one even as we are one, 





###### 23 


I in them and you in me, that they may become perfectly one, so that the world may know that you sent me and loved them even as you loved me. 





###### 24 


Father, I desire that they also, whom you have given me, may be with me where I am, to see my glory that you have given me because you loved me before the foundation of the world. 





###### 25 


O righteous Father, even though the world does not know you, I know you, and these know that you have sent me. 





###### 26 


I made known to them your name, and I will continue to make it known, that the love with which you have loved me may be in them, and I in them." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

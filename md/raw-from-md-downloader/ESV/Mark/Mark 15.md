# Mark 15

***






###### 1 


And as soon as it was morning, the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council. And they bound Jesus and led him away and delivered him over to Pilate. 





###### 2 


And Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" And he answered him, "You have said so." 





###### 3 


And the chief priests accused him of many things. 





###### 4 


And Pilate again asked him, "Have you no answer to make? See how many charges they bring against you." 





###### 5 


But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate was amazed. ## Pilate Delivers Jesus to Be Crucified 





###### 6 


Now at the feast he used to release for them one prisoner for whom they asked. 





###### 7 


And among the rebels in prison, who had committed murder in the insurrection, there was a man called Barabbas. 





###### 8 


And the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do as he usually did for them. 





###### 9 


And he answered them, saying, "Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?" 





###### 10 


For he perceived that it was out of envy that the chief priests had delivered him up. 





###### 11 


But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release for them Barabbas instead. 





###### 12 


And Pilate again said to them, "Then what shall I do with the man you call the King of the Jews?" 





###### 13 


And they cried out again, "Crucify him." 





###### 14 


And Pilate said to them, "Why? What evil has he done?" But they shouted all the more, "Crucify him." 





###### 15 


So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released for them Barabbas, and having scourged[^a] Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified. ## Jesus Is Mocked 





###### 16 


And the soldiers led him away inside the palace (that is, the governor's headquarters),[^b] and they called together the whole battalion.[^c] 





###### 17 


And they clothed him in a purple cloak, and twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on him. 





###### 18 


And they began to salute him, "Hail, King of the Jews!" 





###### 19 


And they were striking his head with a reed and spitting on him and kneeling down in homage to him. 





###### 20 


And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the purple cloak and put his own clothes on him. And they led him out to crucify him. ## The Crucifixion 





###### 21 


And they compelled a passerby, Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to carry his cross. 





###### 22 


And they brought him to the place called Golgotha (which means Place of a Skull). 





###### 23 


And they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it. 





###### 24 


And they crucified him and divided his garments among them, casting lots for them, to decide what each should take. 





###### 25 


And it was the third hour[^d] when they crucified him. 





###### 26 


And the inscription of the charge against him read, "The King of the Jews." 





###### 27 


And with him they crucified two robbers, one on his right and one on his left.[^e] 





###### 29 


And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads and saying, "Aha! You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, 





###### 30 


save yourself, and come down from the cross!" 





###### 31 


So also the chief priests with the scribes mocked him to one another, saying, "He saved others; he cannot save himself. 





###### 32 


Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross that we may see and believe." Those who were crucified with him also reviled him. ## The Death of Jesus 





###### 33 


And when the sixth hour[^f] had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.[^g] 





###### 34 


And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?" which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" 





###### 35 


And some of the bystanders hearing it said, "Behold, he is calling Elijah." 





###### 36 


And someone ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink, saying, "Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down." 





###### 37 


And Jesus uttered a loud cry and breathed his last. 





###### 38 


And the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. 





###### 39 


And when the centurion, who stood facing him, saw that in this way he[^h] breathed his last, he said, "Truly this man was the Son[^i] of God!" 





###### 40 


There were also women looking on from a distance, among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome. 





###### 41 


When he was in Galilee, they followed him and ministered to him, and there were also many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem. ## Jesus Is Buried 





###### 42 


And when evening had come, since it was the day of Preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath, 





###### 43 


Joseph of Arimathea, a respected member of the council, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God, took courage and went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. 





###### 44 


Pilate was surprised to hear that he should have already died.[^j] And summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he was already dead. 





###### 45 


And when he learned from the centurion that he was dead, he granted the corpse to Joseph. 





###### 46 


And Joseph[^k] bought a linen shroud, and taking him down, wrapped him in the linen shroud and laid him in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock. And he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb. 





###### 47 


Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

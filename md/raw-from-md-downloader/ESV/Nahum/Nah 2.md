# Nahum 2

***






###### 1 


The scatterer has come up against you. Man the ramparts; watch the road; dress for battle;[^a] collect all your strength. 





###### 2 


For the LORD is restoring the majesty of Jacob as the majesty of Israel, for plunderers have plundered them and ruined their branches. 





###### 3 


The shield of his mighty men is red; his soldiers are clothed in scarlet. The chariots come with flashing metal on the day he musters them; the cypress spears are brandished. 





###### 4 


The chariots race madly through the streets; they rush to and fro through the squares; they gleam like torches; they dart like lightning. 





###### 5 


He remembers his officers; they stumble as they go, they hasten to the wall; the siege tower[^b] is set up. 





###### 6 


The river gates are opened; the palace melts away; 





###### 7 


its mistress[^c] is stripped;[^d] she is carried off, her slave girls lamenting, moaning like doves and beating their breasts. 





###### 8 


Nineveh is like a pool whose waters run away.[^e] "Halt! Halt!" they cry, but none turns back. 





###### 9 


Plunder the silver, plunder the gold! There is no end of the treasure or of the wealth of all precious things. 





###### 10 


Desolate! Desolation and ruin! Hearts melt and knees tremble; anguish is in all loins; all faces grow pale! 





###### 11 


Where is the lions' den, the feeding place of the young lions, where the lion and lioness went, where his cubs were, with none to disturb? 





###### 12 


The lion tore enough for his cubs and strangled prey for his lionesses; he filled his caves with prey and his dens with torn flesh. 





###### 13 


Behold, I am against you, declares the LORD of hosts, and I will burn your[^f] chariots in smoke, and the sword shall devour your young lions. I will cut off your prey from the earth, and the voice of your messengers shall no longer be heard. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Proverbs 13

***






###### 1 


A wise son hears his father's instruction, but a scoffer does not listen to rebuke. 





###### 2 


From the fruit of his mouth a man eats what is good, but the desire of the treacherous is for violence. 





###### 3 


Whoever guards his mouth preserves his life; he who opens wide his lips comes to ruin. 





###### 4 


The soul of the sluggard craves and gets nothing, while the soul of the diligent is richly supplied. 





###### 5 


The righteous hates falsehood, but the wicked brings shame[^a] and disgrace. 





###### 6 


Righteousness guards him whose way is blameless, but sin overthrows the wicked. 





###### 7 


One pretends to be rich,[^b] yet has nothing; another pretends to be poor,[^c] yet has great wealth. 





###### 8 


The ransom of a man's life is his wealth, but a poor man hears no threat. 





###### 9 


The light of the righteous rejoices, but the lamp of the wicked will be put out. 





###### 10 


By insolence comes nothing but strife, but with those who take advice is wisdom. 





###### 11 


Wealth gained hastily[^d] will dwindle, but whoever gathers little by little will increase it. 





###### 12 


Hope deferred makes the heart sick, but a desire fulfilled is a tree of life. 





###### 13 


Whoever despises the word[^e] brings destruction on himself, but he who reveres the commandment[^f] will be rewarded. 





###### 14 


The teaching of the wise is a fountain of life, that one may turn away from the snares of death. 





###### 15 


Good sense wins favor, but the way of the treacherous is their ruin.[^g] 





###### 16 


Every prudent man acts with knowledge, but a fool flaunts his folly. 





###### 17 


A wicked messenger falls into trouble, but a faithful envoy brings healing. 





###### 18 


Poverty and disgrace come to him who ignores instruction, but whoever heeds reproof is honored. 





###### 19 


A desire fulfilled is sweet to the soul, but to turn away from evil is an abomination to fools. 





###### 20 


Whoever walks with the wise becomes wise, but the companion of fools will suffer harm. 





###### 21 


Disaster[^h] pursues sinners, but the righteous are rewarded with good. 





###### 22 


A good man leaves an inheritance to his children's children, but the sinner's wealth is laid up for the righteous. 





###### 23 


The fallow ground of the poor would yield much food, but it is swept away through injustice. 





###### 24 


Whoever spares the rod hates his son, but he who loves him is diligent to discipline him.[^i] 





###### 25 


The righteous has enough to satisfy his appetite, but the belly of the wicked suffers want. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

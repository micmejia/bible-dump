# Proverbs 2

***






###### 1 


My son, if you receive my words and treasure up my commandments with you, 





###### 2 


making your ear attentive to wisdom and inclining your heart to understanding; 





###### 3 


yes, if you call out for insight and raise your voice for understanding, 





###### 4 


if you seek it like silver and search for it as for hidden treasures, 





###### 5 


then you will understand the fear of the LORD and find the knowledge of God. 





###### 6 


For the LORD gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding; 





###### 7 


he stores up sound wisdom for the upright; he is a shield to those who walk in integrity, 





###### 8 


guarding the paths of justice and watching over the way of his saints. 





###### 9 


Then you will understand righteousness and justice and equity, every good path; 





###### 10 


for wisdom will come into your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul; 





###### 11 


discretion will watch over you, understanding will guard you, 





###### 12 


delivering you from the way of evil, from men of perverted speech, 





###### 13 


who forsake the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness, 





###### 14 


who rejoice in doing evil and delight in the perverseness of evil, 





###### 15 


men whose paths are crooked, and who are devious in their ways. 





###### 16 


So you will be delivered from the forbidden[^a] woman, from the adulteress[^b] with her smooth words, 





###### 17 


who forsakes the companion of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God; 





###### 18 


for her house sinks down to death, and her paths to the departed;[^c] 





###### 19 


none who go to her come back, nor do they regain the paths of life. 





###### 20 


So you will walk in the way of the good and keep to the paths of the righteous. 





###### 21 


For the upright will inhabit the land, and those with integrity will remain in it, 





###### 22 


but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the treacherous will be rooted out of it. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Proverbs 3

***






###### 1 


My son, do not forget my teaching, but let your heart keep my commandments, 





###### 2 


for length of days and years of life and peace they will add to you. 





###### 3 


Let not steadfast love and faithfulness forsake you; bind them around your neck; write them on the tablet of your heart. 





###### 4 


So you will find favor and good success[^a] in the sight of God and man. 





###### 5 


Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. 





###### 6 


In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths. 





###### 7 


Be not wise in your own eyes; fear the LORD, and turn away from evil. 





###### 8 


It will be healing to your flesh[^b] and refreshment[^c] to your bones. 





###### 9 


Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the firstfruits of all your produce; 





###### 10 


then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will be bursting with wine. 





###### 11 


My son, do not despise the LORD's discipline or be weary of his reproof, 





###### 12 


for the LORD reproves him whom he loves, as a father the son in whom he delights. ## Blessed Is the One Who Finds Wisdom 





###### 13 


Blessed is the one who finds wisdom, and the one who gets understanding, 





###### 14 


for the gain from her is better than gain from silver and her profit better than gold. 





###### 15 


She is more precious than jewels, and nothing you desire can compare with her. 





###### 16 


Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor. 





###### 17 


Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. 





###### 18 


She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her; those who hold her fast are called blessed. 





###### 19 


The LORD by wisdom founded the earth; by understanding he established the heavens; 





###### 20 


by his knowledge the deeps broke open, and the clouds drop down the dew. 





###### 21 


My son, do not lose sight of these-- keep sound wisdom and discretion, 





###### 22 


and they will be life for your soul and adornment for your neck. 





###### 23 


Then you will walk on your way securely, and your foot will not stumble. 





###### 24 


If you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet. 





###### 25 


Do not be afraid of sudden terror or of the ruin[^d] of the wicked, when it comes, 





###### 26 


for the LORD will be your confidence and will keep your foot from being caught. 





###### 27 


Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due,[^e] when it is in your power to do it. 





###### 28 


Do not say to your neighbor, "Go, and come again, tomorrow I will give it"--when you have it with you. 





###### 29 


Do not plan evil against your neighbor, who dwells trustingly beside you. 





###### 30 


Do not contend with a man for no reason, when he has done you no harm. 





###### 31 


Do not envy a man of violence and do not choose any of his ways, 





###### 32 


for the devious person is an abomination to the LORD, but the upright are in his confidence. 





###### 33 


The LORD's curse is on the house of the wicked, but he blesses the dwelling of the righteous. 





###### 34 


Toward the scorners he is scornful, but to the humble he gives favor.[^f] 





###### 35 


The wise will inherit honor, but fools get[^g] disgrace. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

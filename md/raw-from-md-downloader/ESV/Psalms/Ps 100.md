# Psalms 100

***






###### 1 


Make a joyful noise to the LORD, all the earth! 





###### 2 


Serve the LORD with gladness! Come into his presence with singing! 





###### 3 


Know that the LORD, he is God! It is he who made us, and we are his;[^a] we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture. 





###### 4 


Enter his gates with thanksgiving, and his courts with praise! Give thanks to him; bless his name! 





###### 5 


For the LORD is good; his steadfast love endures forever, and his faithfulness to all generations. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

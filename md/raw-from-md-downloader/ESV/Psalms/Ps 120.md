# Psalms 120

***






###### 1 


In my distress I called to the LORD, and he answered me. 





###### 2 


Deliver me, O LORD, from lying lips, from a deceitful tongue. 





###### 3 


What shall be given to you, and what more shall be done to you, you deceitful tongue? 





###### 4 


A warrior's sharp arrows, with glowing coals of the broom tree! 





###### 5 


Woe to me, that I sojourn in Meshech, that I dwell among the tents of Kedar! 





###### 6 


Too long have I had my dwelling among those who hate peace. 





###### 7 


I am for peace, but when I speak, they are for war! ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

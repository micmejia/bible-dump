# Psalms 123

***






###### 1 


To you I lift up my eyes, O you who are enthroned in the heavens! 





###### 2 


Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maidservant to the hand of her mistress, so our eyes look to the LORD our God, till he has mercy upon us. 





###### 3 


Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us, for we have had more than enough of contempt. 





###### 4 


Our soul has had more than enough of the scorn of those who are at ease, of the contempt of the proud. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

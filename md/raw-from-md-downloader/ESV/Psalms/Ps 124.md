# Psalms 124

***






###### 1 


If it had not been the LORD who was on our side-- let Israel now say-- 





###### 2 


if it had not been the LORD who was on our side when people rose up against us, 





###### 3 


then they would have swallowed us up alive, when their anger was kindled against us; 





###### 4 


then the flood would have swept us away, the torrent would have gone over us; 





###### 5 


then over us would have gone the raging waters. 





###### 6 


Blessed be the LORD, who has not given us as prey to their teeth! 





###### 7 


We have escaped like a bird from the snare of the fowlers; the snare is broken, and we have escaped! 





###### 8

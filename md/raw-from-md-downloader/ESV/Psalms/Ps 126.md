# Psalms 126

***






###### 1 


When the LORD restored the fortunes of Zion, we were like those who dream. 





###### 2 


Then our mouth was filled with laughter, and our tongue with shouts of joy; then they said among the nations, "The LORD has done great things for them." 





###### 3 


The LORD has done great things for us; we are glad. 





###### 4 


Restore our fortunes, O LORD, like streams in the Negeb! 





###### 5 


Those who sow in tears shall reap with shouts of joy! 





###### 6 


He who goes out weeping, bearing the seed for sowing, shall come home with shouts of joy, bringing his sheaves with him. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

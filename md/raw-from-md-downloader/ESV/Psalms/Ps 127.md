# Psalms 127

***






###### 1 


Unless the LORD builds the house, those who build it labor in vain. Unless the LORD watches over the city, the watchman stays awake in vain. 





###### 2 


It is in vain that you rise up early and go late to rest, eating the bread of anxious toil; for he gives to his beloved sleep. 





###### 3 


Behold, children are a heritage from the LORD, the fruit of the womb a reward. 





###### 4 


Like arrows in the hand of a warrior are the children[^a] of one's youth. 





###### 5 


Blessed is the man who fills his quiver with them! He shall not be put to shame when he speaks with his enemies in the gate.[^b] ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

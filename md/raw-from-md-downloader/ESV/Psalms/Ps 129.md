# Psalms 129

***






###### 1 


"Greatly[^a] have they afflicted me from my youth"-- let Israel now say-- 





###### 2 


"Greatly have they afflicted me from my youth, yet they have not prevailed against me. 





###### 3 


The plowers plowed upon my back; they made long their furrows." 





###### 4 


The LORD is righteous; he has cut the cords of the wicked. 





###### 5 


May all who hate Zion be put to shame and turned backward! 





###### 6 


Let them be like the grass on the housetops, which withers before it grows up, 





###### 7 


with which the reaper does not fill his hand nor the binder of sheaves his arms, 





###### 8 


nor do those who pass by say, "The blessing of the LORD be upon you! We bless you in the name of the LORD!" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

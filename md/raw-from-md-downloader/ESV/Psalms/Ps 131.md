# Psalms 131

***






###### 1 


O LORD, my heart is not lifted up; my eyes are not raised too high; I do not occupy myself with things too great and too marvelous for me. 





###### 2 


But I have calmed and quieted my soul, like a weaned child with its mother; like a weaned child is my soul within me. 





###### 3 


O Israel, hope in the LORD from this time forth and forevermore. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Psalms 133

***






###### 1 


Behold, how good and pleasant it is when brothers dwell in unity![^a] 





###### 2 


It is like the precious oil on the head, running down on the beard, on the beard of Aaron, running down on the collar of his robes! 





###### 3 


It is like the dew of Hermon, which falls on the mountains of Zion! For there the LORD has commanded the blessing, life forevermore. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

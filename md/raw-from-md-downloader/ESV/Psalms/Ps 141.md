# Psalms 141

***






###### 1 


O LORD, I call upon you; hasten to me! Give ear to my voice when I call to you! 





###### 2 


Let my prayer be counted as incense before you, and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice! 





###### 3 


Set a guard, O LORD, over my mouth; keep watch over the door of my lips! 





###### 4 


Do not let my heart incline to any evil, to busy myself with wicked deeds in company with men who work iniquity, and let me not eat of their delicacies! 





###### 5 


Let a righteous man strike me--it is a kindness; let him rebuke me--it is oil for my head; let my head not refuse it. Yet my prayer is continually against their evil deeds. 





###### 6 


When their judges are thrown over the cliff,[^a] then they shall hear my words, for they are pleasant. 





###### 7 


As when one plows and breaks up the earth, so shall our bones be scattered at the mouth of Sheol.[^b] 





###### 8 


But my eyes are toward you, O God, my Lord; in you I seek refuge; leave me not defenseless![^c] 





###### 9 


Keep me from the trap that they have laid for me and from the snares of evildoers! 





###### 10 


Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while I pass by safely. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

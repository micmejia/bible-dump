# Psalms 5

***






###### 1 


Give ear to my words, O LORD; consider my groaning. 





###### 2 


Give attention to the sound of my cry, my King and my God, for to you do I pray. 





###### 3 


O LORD, in the morning you hear my voice; in the morning I prepare a sacrifice for you[^a] and watch. 





###### 4 


For you are not a God who delights in wickedness; evil may not dwell with you. 





###### 5 


The boastful shall not stand before your eyes; you hate all evildoers. 





###### 6 


You destroy those who speak lies; the LORD abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man. 





###### 7 


But I, through the abundance of your steadfast love, will enter your house. I will bow down toward your holy temple in the fear of you. 





###### 8 


Lead me, O LORD, in your righteousness because of my enemies; make your way straight before me. 





###### 9 


For there is no truth in their mouth; their inmost self is destruction; their throat is an open grave; they flatter with their tongue. 





###### 10 


Make them bear their guilt, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; because of the abundance of their transgressions cast them out, for they have rebelled against you. 





###### 11 


But let all who take refuge in you rejoice; let them ever sing for joy, and spread your protection over them, that those who love your name may exult in you. 





###### 12 


For you bless the righteous, O LORD; you cover him with favor as with a shield. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

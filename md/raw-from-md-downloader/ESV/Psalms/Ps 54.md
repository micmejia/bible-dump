# Psalms 54

***






###### 1 


O God, save me by your name, and vindicate me by your might. 





###### 2 


O God, hear my prayer; give ear to the words of my mouth. 





###### 3 


For strangers[^b] have risen against me; ruthless men seek my life; they do not set God before themselves. Selah 





###### 4 


Behold, God is my helper; the Lord is the upholder of my life. 





###### 5 


He will return the evil to my enemies; in your faithfulness put an end to them. 





###### 6 


With a freewill offering I will sacrifice to you; I will give thanks to your name, O LORD, for it is good. 





###### 7 


For he has delivered me from every trouble, and my eye has looked in triumph on my enemies. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Psalms 56

***






###### 1 


Be gracious to me, O God, for man tramples on me; all day long an attacker oppresses me; 





###### 2 


my enemies trample on me all day long, for many attack me proudly. 





###### 3 


When I am afraid, I put my trust in you. 





###### 4 


In God, whose word I praise, in God I trust; I shall not be afraid. What can flesh do to me? 





###### 5 


All day long they injure my cause;[^b] all their thoughts are against me for evil. 





###### 6 


They stir up strife, they lurk; they watch my steps, as they have waited for my life. 





###### 7 


For their crime will they escape? In wrath cast down the peoples, O God! 





###### 8 


You have kept count of my tossings;[^c] put my tears in your bottle. Are they not in your book? 





###### 9 


Then my enemies will turn back in the day when I call. This I know, that[^d] God is for me. 





###### 10 


In God, whose word I praise, in the LORD, whose word I praise, 





###### 11 


in God I trust; I shall not be afraid. What can man do to me? 





###### 12 


I must perform my vows to you, O God; I will render thank offerings to you. 





###### 13 


For you have delivered my soul from death, yes, my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of life. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

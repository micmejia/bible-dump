# Psalms 6

***






###### 1 


O LORD, rebuke me not in your anger, nor discipline me in your wrath. 





###### 2 


Be gracious to me, O LORD, for I am languishing; heal me, O LORD, for my bones are troubled. 





###### 3 


My soul also is greatly troubled. But you, O LORD--how long? 





###### 4 


Turn, O LORD, deliver my life; save me for the sake of your steadfast love. 





###### 5 


For in death there is no remembrance of you; in Sheol who will give you praise? 





###### 6 


I am weary with my moaning; every night I flood my bed with tears; I drench my couch with my weeping. 





###### 7 


My eye wastes away because of grief; it grows weak because of all my foes. 





###### 8 


Depart from me, all you workers of evil, for the LORD has heard the sound of my weeping. 





###### 9 


The LORD has heard my plea; the LORD accepts my prayer. 





###### 10 


All my enemies shall be ashamed and greatly troubled; they shall turn back and be put to shame in a moment. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Psalms 7

***






###### 1 


O LORD my God, in you do I take refuge; save me from all my pursuers and deliver me, 





###### 2 


lest like a lion they tear my soul apart, rending it in pieces, with none to deliver. 





###### 3 


O LORD my God, if I have done this, if there is wrong in my hands, 





###### 4 


if I have repaid my friend[^b] with evil or plundered my enemy without cause, 





###### 5 


let the enemy pursue my soul and overtake it, and let him trample my life to the ground and lay my glory in the dust. Selah 





###### 6 


Arise, O LORD, in your anger; lift yourself up against the fury of my enemies; awake for me; you have appointed a judgment. 





###### 7 


Let the assembly of the peoples be gathered about you; over it return on high. 





###### 8 


The LORD judges the peoples; judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness and according to the integrity that is in me. 





###### 9 


Oh, let the evil of the wicked come to an end, and may you establish the righteous-- you who test the minds and hearts,[^c] O righteous God! 





###### 10 


My shield is with God, who saves the upright in heart. 





###### 11 


God is a righteous judge, and a God who feels indignation every day. 





###### 12 


If a man[^d] does not repent, God[^e] will whet his sword; he has bent and readied his bow; 





###### 13 


he has prepared for him his deadly weapons, making his arrows fiery shafts. 





###### 14 


Behold, the wicked man conceives evil and is pregnant with mischief and gives birth to lies. 





###### 15 


He makes a pit, digging it out, and falls into the hole that he has made. 





###### 16 


His mischief returns upon his own head, and on his own skull his violence descends. 





###### 17 


I will give to the LORD the thanks due to his righteousness, and I will sing praise to the name of the LORD, the Most High. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

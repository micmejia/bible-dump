# Psalms 8

***






###### 1 


O LORD, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth! You have set your glory above the heavens. 





###### 2 


Out of the mouth of babies and infants, you have established strength because of your foes, to still the enemy and the avenger. 





###### 3 


When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place, 





###### 4 


what is man that you are mindful of him, and the son of man that you care for him? 





###### 5 


Yet you have made him a little lower than the heavenly beings[^b] and crowned him with glory and honor. 





###### 6 


You have given him dominion over the works of your hands; you have put all things under his feet, 





###### 7 


all sheep and oxen, and also the beasts of the field, 





###### 8 


the birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea, whatever passes along the paths of the seas. 





###### 9

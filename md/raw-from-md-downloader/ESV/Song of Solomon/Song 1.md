# Song of Solomon 1

***






###### 1 


The Song of Songs, which is Solomon's. ## The Bride Confesses Her Love 





###### 2 


Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth! For your love is better than wine; 





###### 3 


your anointing oils are fragrant; your name is oil poured out; therefore virgins love you. 





###### 4 


Draw me after you; let us run. The king has brought me into his chambers. We will exult and rejoice in you; we will extol your love more than wine; rightly do they love you. 





###### 5 


I am very dark, but lovely, O daughters of Jerusalem, like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon. 





###### 6 


Do not gaze at me because I am dark, because the sun has looked upon me. My mother's sons were angry with me; they made me keeper of the vineyards, but my own vineyard I have not kept! 





###### 7 


Tell me, you whom my soul loves, where you pasture your flock, where you make it lie down at noon; for why should I be like one who veils herself beside the flocks of your companions? ## Solomon and His Bride Delight in Each Other 





###### 8 


If you do not know, O most beautiful among women, follow in the tracks of the flock, and pasture your young goats beside the shepherds' tents. 





###### 9 


I compare you, my love, to a mare among Pharaoh's chariots. 





###### 10 


Your cheeks are lovely with ornaments, your neck with strings of jewels. 





###### 11 


We will make for you[^b] ornaments of gold, studded with silver. 





###### 12 


While the king was on his couch, my nard gave forth its fragrance. 





###### 13 


My beloved is to me a sachet of myrrh that lies between my breasts. 





###### 14 


My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms in the vineyards of Engedi. 





###### 15 


Behold, you are beautiful, my love; behold, you are beautiful; your eyes are doves. 





###### 16 


Behold, you are beautiful, my beloved, truly delightful. Our couch is green; 





###### 17 


the beams of our house are cedar; our rafters are pine. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

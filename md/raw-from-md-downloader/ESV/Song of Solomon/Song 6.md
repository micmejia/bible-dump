# Song of Solomon 6

***






###### 1 


Where has your beloved gone, O most beautiful among women? Where has your beloved turned, that we may seek him with you? ## Together in the Garden of Love 





###### 2 


My beloved has gone down to his garden to the beds of spices, to graze[^a] in the gardens and to gather lilies. 





###### 3 


I am my beloved's and my beloved is mine; he grazes among the lilies. ## Solomon and His Bride Delight in Each Other 





###### 4 


You are beautiful as Tirzah, my love, lovely as Jerusalem, awesome as an army with banners. 





###### 5 


Turn away your eyes from me, for they overwhelm me-- Your hair is like a flock of goats leaping down the slopes of Gilead. 





###### 6 


Your teeth are like a flock of ewes that have come up from the washing; all of them bear twins; not one among them has lost its young. 





###### 7 


Your cheeks are like halves of a pomegranate behind your veil. 





###### 8 


There are sixty queens and eighty concubines, and virgins without number. 





###### 9 


My dove, my perfect one, is the only one, the only one of her mother, pure to her who bore her. The young women saw her and called her blessed; the queens and concubines also, and they praised her. 





###### 10 


"Who is this who looks down like the dawn, beautiful as the moon, bright as the sun, awesome as an army with banners?" 





###### 11 


I went down to the nut orchard to look at the blossoms of the valley, to see whether the vines had budded, whether the pomegranates were in bloom. 





###### 12 


Before I was aware, my desire set me among the chariots of my kinsman, a prince.[^b] 





###### 13 


[^c] Return, return, O Shulammite, return, return, that we may look upon you. Why should you look upon the Shulammite, as upon a dance before two armies?[^d] ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

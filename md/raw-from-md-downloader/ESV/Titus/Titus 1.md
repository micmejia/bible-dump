# Titus 1

***






###### 1 


Paul, a servant[^a] of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, for the sake of the faith of God's elect and their knowledge of the truth, which accords with godliness, 





###### 2 


in hope of eternal life, which God, who never lies, promised before the ages began[^b] 





###### 3 


and at the proper time manifested in his word[^c] through the preaching with which I have been entrusted by the command of God our Savior; 





###### 4 


To Titus, my true child in a common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior. ## Qualifications for Elders 





###### 5 


This is why I left you in Crete, so that you might put what remained into order, and appoint elders in every town as I directed you-- 





###### 6 


if anyone is above reproach, the husband of one wife,[^d] and his children are believers[^e] and not open to the charge of debauchery or insubordination. 





###### 7 


For an overseer,[^f] as God's steward, must be above reproach. He must not be arrogant or quick-tempered or a drunkard or violent or greedy for gain, 





###### 8 


but hospitable, a lover of good, self-controlled, upright, holy, and disciplined. 





###### 9 


He must hold firm to the trustworthy word as taught, so that he may be able to give instruction in sound[^g] doctrine and also to rebuke those who contradict it. 





###### 10 


For there are many who are insubordinate, empty talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision party.[^h] 





###### 11 


They must be silenced, since they are upsetting whole families by teaching for shameful gain what they ought not to teach. 





###### 12 


One of the Cretans,[^i] a prophet of their own, said, "Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons."[^j] 





###### 13 


This testimony is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith, 





###### 14 


not devoting themselves to Jewish myths and the commands of people who turn away from the truth. 





###### 15 


To the pure, all things are pure, but to the defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their minds and their consciences are defiled. 





###### 16 


They profess to know God, but they deny him by their works. They are detestable, disobedient, unfit for any good work. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

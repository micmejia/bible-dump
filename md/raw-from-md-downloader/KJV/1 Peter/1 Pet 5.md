# 1 Peter 5

***


















###### 1 








The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed: 

















###### 2 








Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; 

















###### 3 








Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being examples to the flock. 

















###### 4 








And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away. 

















###### 5 








Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble. 

















###### 6 








Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time: 

















###### 7 








Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you. 

















###### 8 








Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour: 

















###### 9 








Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world. 

















###### 10 








But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you. 

















###### 11 








To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. 

















###### 12 








By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand. 

















###### 13 








The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you; and so doth Marcus my son. 

















###### 14 








Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

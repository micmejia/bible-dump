# 2 Timothy 2

***


















###### 1 








Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. 

















###### 2 








And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also. 

















###### 3 








Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. 

















###### 4 








No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier. 

















###### 5 








And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully. 

















###### 6 








The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits. 

















###### 7 








Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things. 

















###### 8 








Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel: 

















###### 9 








Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound. 

















###### 10 








Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. 

















###### 11 








It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him: 

















###### 12 








If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us: 

















###### 13 








If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself. 

















###### 14 








Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers. 

















###### 15 








Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. 

















###### 16 








But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness. 

















###### 17 








And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus; 

















###### 18 








Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some. 

















###### 19 








Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity. 

















###### 20 








But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour. 

















###### 21 








If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work. 

















###### 22 








Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart. 

















###### 23 








But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes. 

















###### 24 








And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient, 

















###### 25 








In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth; 

















###### 26 








And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Ezekiel 15

***


















###### 1 








And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 

















###### 2 








Son of man, what is the vine tree more than any tree, or than a branch which is among the trees of the forest? 

















###### 3 








Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon? 

















###### 4 








Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it meet for any work? 

















###### 5 








Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less shall it be meet yet for any work, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is burned? 

















###### 6 








Therefore thus saith the Lord God; As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 

















###### 7 








And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from one fire, and another fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I set my face against them. 

















###### 8 








And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, saith the Lord God. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

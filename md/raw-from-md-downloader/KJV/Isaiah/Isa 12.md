# Isaiah 12

***


















###### 1 








And in that day thou shalt say, O LORD, I will praise thee: though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortedst me. 

















###### 2 








Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the Lord Jehovah is my strength and my song; he also is become my salvation. 

















###### 3 








Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation. 

















###### 4 








And in that day shall ye say, Praise the LORD, call upon his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted. 

















###### 5 








Sing unto the LORD; for he hath done excellent things: this is known in all the earth. 

















###### 6 








Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

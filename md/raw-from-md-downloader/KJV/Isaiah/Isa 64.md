# Isaiah 64

***


















###### 1 








Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence, 

















###### 2 








As when the melting fire burneth, the fire causeth the waters to boil, to make thy name known to thine adversaries, that the nations may tremble at thy presence! 

















###### 3 








When thou didst terrible things which we looked not for, thou camest down, the mountains flowed down at thy presence. 

















###### 4 








For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him. 

















###### 5 








Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness, those that remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou art wroth; for we have sinned: in those is continuance, and we shall be saved. 

















###### 6 








But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away. 

















###### 7 








And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee: for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast consumed us, because of our iniquities. 

















###### 8 








But now, O LORD, thou art our father; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand. 

















###### 9 








Be not wroth very sore, O LORD, neither remember iniquity for ever: behold, see, we beseech thee, we are all thy people. 

















###### 10 








Thy holy cities are a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation. 

















###### 11 








Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, is burned up with fire: and all our pleasant things are laid waste. 

















###### 12 








Wilt thou refrain thyself for these things, O LORD? wilt thou hold thy peace, and afflict us very sore? ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

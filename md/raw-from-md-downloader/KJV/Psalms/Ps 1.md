# Psalms 1

***


















###### 1 








Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful. 

















###### 2 








But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night. 

















###### 3 








And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper. 

















###### 4 








The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away. 

















###### 5 








Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. 

















###### 6 








For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

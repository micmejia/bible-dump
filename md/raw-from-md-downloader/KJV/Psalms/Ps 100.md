# Psalms 100

***


















###### 1 








Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands. 

















###### 2 








Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with singing. 

















###### 3 








Know ye that the LORD he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture. 

















###### 4 








Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name. 

















###### 5 








For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endureth to all generations. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Psalms 11

***


















###### 1 








In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a bird to your mountain? 

















###### 2 








For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart. 

















###### 3 








If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do? 

















###### 4 








The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD's throne is in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men. 

















###### 5 








The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth. 

















###### 6 








Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup. 

















###### 7 








For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

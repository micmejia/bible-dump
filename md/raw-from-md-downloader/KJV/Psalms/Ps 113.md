# Psalms 113

***


















###### 1 








Praise ye the LORD. Praise, O ye servants of the LORD, praise the name of the LORD. 

















###### 2 








Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and for evermore. 

















###### 3 








From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the LORD's name is to be praised. 

















###### 4 








The LORD is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens. 

















###### 5 








Who is like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth on high, 

















###### 6 








Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in the earth! 

















###### 7 








He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill; 

















###### 8 








That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people. 

















###### 9 








He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children. Praise ye the LORD. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

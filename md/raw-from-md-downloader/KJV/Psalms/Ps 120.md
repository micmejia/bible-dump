# Psalms 120

***


















###### 1 








In my distress I cried unto the LORD, and he heard me. 

















###### 2 








Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, and from a deceitful tongue. 

















###### 3 








What shall be given unto thee? or what shall be done unto thee, thou false tongue? 

















###### 4 








Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper. 

















###### 5 








Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar! 

















###### 6 








My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace. 

















###### 7 








I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Psalms 121

***


















###### 1 








I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help. 

















###### 2 








My help cometh from the LORD, which made heaven and earth. 

















###### 3 








He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber. 

















###### 4 








Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep. 

















###### 5 








The LORD is thy keeper: the LORD is thy shade upon thy right hand. 

















###### 6 








The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night. 

















###### 7 








The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul. 

















###### 8 








The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

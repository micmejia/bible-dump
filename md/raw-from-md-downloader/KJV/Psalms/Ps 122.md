# Psalms 122

***


















###### 1 








I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the LORD. 

















###### 2 








Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem. 

















###### 3 








Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together: 

















###### 4 








Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD. 

















###### 5 








For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David. 

















###### 6 








Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee. 

















###### 7 








Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces. 

















###### 8 








For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee. 

















###### 9 








Because of the house of the LORD our God I will seek thy good. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

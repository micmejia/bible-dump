# Psalms 123

***


















###### 1 








Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens. 

















###### 2 








Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until that he have mercy upon us. 

















###### 3 








Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us: for we are exceedingly filled with contempt. 

















###### 4 








Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease, and with the contempt of the proud. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

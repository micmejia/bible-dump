# Psalms 124

***


















###### 1 








If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, now may Israel say; 

















###### 2 








If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when men rose up against us: 

















###### 3 








Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us: 

















###### 4 








Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul: 

















###### 5 








Then the proud waters had gone over our soul. 

















###### 6 








Blessed be the LORD, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth. 

















###### 7 








Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped. 

















###### 8

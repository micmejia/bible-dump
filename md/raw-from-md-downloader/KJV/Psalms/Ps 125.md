# Psalms 125

***


















###### 1 








They that trust in the LORD shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever. 

















###### 2 








As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is round about his people from henceforth even for ever. 

















###### 3 








For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity. 

















###### 4 








Do good, O LORD, unto those that be good, and to them that are upright in their hearts. 

















###### 5 








As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the LORD shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: but peace shall be upon Israel. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

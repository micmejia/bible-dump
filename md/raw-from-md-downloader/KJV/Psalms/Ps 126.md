# Psalms 126

***


















###### 1 








When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream. 

















###### 2 








Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done great things for them. 

















###### 3 








The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad. 

















###### 4 








Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south. 

















###### 5 








They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. 

















###### 6 








He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

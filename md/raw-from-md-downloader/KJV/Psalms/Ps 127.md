# Psalms 127

***


















###### 1 








Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain. 

















###### 2 








It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep. 

















###### 3 








Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the womb is his reward. 

















###### 4 








As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth. 

















###### 5 








Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

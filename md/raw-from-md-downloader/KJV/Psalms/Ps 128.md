# Psalms 128

***


















###### 1 








Blessed is every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in his ways. 

















###### 2 








For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee. 

















###### 3 








Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house: thy children like olive plants round about thy table. 

















###### 4 








Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the LORD. 

















###### 5 








The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life. 

















###### 6 








Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children, and peace upon Israel. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

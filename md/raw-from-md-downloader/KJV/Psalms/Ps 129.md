# Psalms 129

***


















###### 1 








Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say: 

















###### 2 








Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they have not prevailed against me. 

















###### 3 








The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows. 

















###### 4 








The LORD is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked. 

















###### 5 








Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion. 

















###### 6 








Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth afore it groweth up: 

















###### 7 








Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom. 

















###### 8 








Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD be upon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

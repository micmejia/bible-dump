# Psalms 13

***


















###### 1 








How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me? 

















###### 2 








How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me? 

















###### 3 








Consider and hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death; 

















###### 4 








Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved. 

















###### 5 








But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation. 

















###### 6 








I will sing unto the LORD, because he hath dealt bountifully with me. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

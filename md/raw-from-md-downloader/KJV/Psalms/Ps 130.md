# Psalms 130

***


















###### 1 








Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O LORD. 

















###### 2 








Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications. 

















###### 3 








If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand? 

















###### 4 








But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared. 

















###### 5 








I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope. 

















###### 6 








My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning. 

















###### 7 








Let Israel hope in the LORD: for with the LORD there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption. 

















###### 8 








And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Psalms 131

***


















###### 1 








Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me. 

















###### 2 








Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child. 

















###### 3 








Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

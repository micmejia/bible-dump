# Psalms 142

***


















###### 1 








I cried unto the LORD with my voice; with my voice unto the LORD did I make my supplication. 

















###### 2 








I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my trouble. 

















###### 3 








When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me. 

















###### 4 








I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul. 

















###### 5 








I cried unto thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living. 

















###### 6 








Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I. 

















###### 7 








Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

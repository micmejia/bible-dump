# Psalms 15

***


















###### 1 








Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill? 

















###### 2 








He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart. 

















###### 3 








He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour. 

















###### 4 








In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them that fear the LORD. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not. 

















###### 5 








He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

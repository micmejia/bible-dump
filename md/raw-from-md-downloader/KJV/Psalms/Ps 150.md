# Psalms 150

***


















###### 1 








Praise ye the LORD. Praise God in his sanctuary: praise him in the firmament of his power. 

















###### 2 








Praise him for his mighty acts: praise him according to his excellent greatness. 

















###### 3 








Praise him with the sound of the trumpet: praise him with the psaltery and harp. 

















###### 4 








Praise him with the timbrel and dance: praise him with stringed instruments and organs. 

















###### 5 








Praise him upon the loud cymbals: praise him upon the high sounding cymbals. 

















###### 6 








Let every thing that hath breath praise the LORD. Praise ye the LORD. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

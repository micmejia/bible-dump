# Psalms 2

***


















###### 1 








Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? 

















###### 2 








The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, saying, 

















###### 3 








Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us. 

















###### 4 








He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the LORD shall have them in derision. 

















###### 5 








Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure. 

















###### 6 








Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion. 

















###### 7 








I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee. 

















###### 8 








Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. 

















###### 9 








Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel. 

















###### 10 








Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth. 

















###### 11 








Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling. 

















###### 12 








Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

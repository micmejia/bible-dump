# Psalms 20

***


















###### 1 








The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob defend thee; 

















###### 2 








Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Zion; 

















###### 3 








Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice; Selah. 

















###### 4 








Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy counsel. 

















###### 5 








We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up our banners: the LORD fulfil all thy petitions. 

















###### 6 








Now know I that the LORD saveth his anointed; he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand. 

















###### 7 








Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the name of the LORD our God. 

















###### 8 








They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright. 

















###### 9 








Save, LORD: let the king hear us when we call. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

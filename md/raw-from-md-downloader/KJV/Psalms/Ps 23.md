# Psalms 23

***


















###### 1 








The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want. 

















###### 2 








He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters. 

















###### 3 








He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. 

















###### 4 








Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. 

















###### 5 








Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. 

















###### 6 








Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

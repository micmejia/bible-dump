# Psalms 3

***


















###### 1 








Lord, how are they increased that trouble me! many are they that rise up against me. 

















###### 2 








Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah. 

















###### 3 








But thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head. 

















###### 4 








I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah. 

















###### 5 








I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me. 

















###### 6 








I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me round about. 

















###### 7 








Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly. 

















###### 8 








Salvation belongeth unto the LORD: thy blessing is upon thy people.

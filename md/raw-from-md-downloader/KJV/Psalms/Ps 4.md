# Psalms 4

***


















###### 1 








Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer. 

















###### 2 








O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame? how long will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing? Selah. 

















###### 3 








But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him. 

















###### 4 








Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah. 

















###### 5 








Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD. 

















###### 6 








There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? LORD, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us. 

















###### 7 








Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased. 

















###### 8 








I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD, only makest me dwell in safety. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

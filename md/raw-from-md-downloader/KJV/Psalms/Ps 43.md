# Psalms 43

***


















###### 1 








Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation: O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man. 

















###### 2 








For thou art the God of my strength: why dost thou cast me off? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy? 

















###### 3 








O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles. 

















###### 4 








Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy: yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God. 

















###### 5 








Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

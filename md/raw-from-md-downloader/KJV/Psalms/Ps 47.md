# Psalms 47

***


















###### 1 








O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice of triumph. 

















###### 2 








For the LORD most high is terrible; he is a great King over all the earth. 

















###### 3 








He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our feet. 

















###### 4 








He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob whom he loved. Selah. 

















###### 5 








God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a trumpet. 

















###### 6 








Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King, sing praises. 

















###### 7 








For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with understanding. 

















###### 8 








God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness. 

















###### 9 








The princes of the people are gathered together, even the people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth belong unto God: he is greatly exalted. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

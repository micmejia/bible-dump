# Psalms 54

***


















###### 1 








Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength. 

















###### 2 








Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth. 

















###### 3 








For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah. 

















###### 4 








Behold, God is mine helper: the Lord is with them that uphold my soul. 

















###### 5 








He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy truth. 

















###### 6 








I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O LORD; for it is good. 

















###### 7 








For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath seen his desire upon mine enemies. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Psalms 56

***


















###### 1 








Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he fighting daily oppresseth me. 

















###### 2 








Mine enemies would daily swallow me up: for they be many that fight against me, O thou most High. 

















###### 3 








What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee. 

















###### 4 








In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me. 

















###### 5 








Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts are against me for evil. 

















###### 6 








They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps, when they wait for my soul. 

















###### 7 








Shall they escape by iniquity? in thine anger cast down the people, O God. 

















###### 8 








Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle: are they not in thy book? 

















###### 9 








When I cry unto thee, then shall mine enemies turn back: this I know; for God is for me. 

















###### 10 








In God will I praise his word: in the LORD will I praise his word. 

















###### 11 








In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me. 

















###### 12 








Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee. 

















###### 13 








For thou hast delivered my soul from death: wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living? ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

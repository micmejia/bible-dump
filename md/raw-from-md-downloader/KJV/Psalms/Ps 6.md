# Psalms 6

***


















###### 1 








O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. 

















###### 2 








Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am weak: O LORD, heal me; for my bones are vexed. 

















###### 3 








My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long? 

















###### 4 








Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies' sake. 

















###### 5 








For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks? 

















###### 6 








I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears. 

















###### 7 








Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies. 

















###### 8 








Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping. 

















###### 9 








The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my prayer. 

















###### 10 








Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return and be ashamed suddenly. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

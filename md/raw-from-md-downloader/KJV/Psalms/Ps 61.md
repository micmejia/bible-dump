# Psalms 61

***


















###### 1 








Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer. 

















###### 2 








From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I. 

















###### 3 








For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the enemy. 

















###### 4 








I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of thy wings. Selah. 

















###### 5 








For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name. 

















###### 6 








Thou wilt prolong the king's life: and his years as many generations. 

















###### 7 








He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth, which may preserve him. 

















###### 8 








So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily perform my vows. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

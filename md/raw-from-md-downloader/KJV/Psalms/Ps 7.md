# Psalms 7

***


















###### 1 








O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me: 

















###### 2 








Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver. 

















###### 3 








O LORD my God, If I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands; 

















###### 4 








If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:) 

















###### 5 








Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah. 

















###### 6 








Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded. 

















###### 7 








So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for their sakes therefore return thou on high. 

















###### 8 








The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me. 

















###### 9 








Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins. 

















###### 10 








My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart. 

















###### 11 








God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day. 

















###### 12 








If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready. 

















###### 13 








He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors. 

















###### 14 








Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood. 

















###### 15 








He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made. 

















###### 16 








His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate. 

















###### 17 








I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

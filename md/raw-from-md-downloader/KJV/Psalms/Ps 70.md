# Psalms 70

***


















###### 1 








Make haste, o God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O LORD. 

















###### 2 








Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt. 

















###### 3 








Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha, aha. 

















###### 4 








Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified. 

















###### 5 








But I am poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou art my help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no tarrying. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Psalms 8

***


















###### 1 








O LORD, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens. 

















###### 2 








Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger. 

















###### 3 








When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; 

















###### 4 








What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him? 

















###### 5 








For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour. 

















###### 6 








Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet: 

















###### 7 








All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field; 

















###### 8 








The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas. 

















###### 9

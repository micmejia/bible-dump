# Psalms 87

***


















###### 1 








His foundation is in the holy mountains. 

















###### 2 








The LORD loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob. 

















###### 3 








Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah. 

















###### 4 








I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me: behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there. 

















###### 5 








And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her: and the highest himself shall establish her. 

















###### 6 








The LORD shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this man was born there. Selah. 

















###### 7 








As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there: all my springs are in thee. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

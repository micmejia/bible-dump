# Psalms 93

***


















###### 1 








The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved. 

















###### 2 








Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting. 

















###### 3 








The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves. 

















###### 4 








The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than the mighty waves of the sea. 

















###### 5 








Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O LORD, for ever. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

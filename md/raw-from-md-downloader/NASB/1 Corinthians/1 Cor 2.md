# 1 Corinthians 2

***








###### 1 



And when I came to you, brothers _and sisters_, I did not come as _someone_ superior in [^a]speaking ability or [^b]wisdom, as I proclaimed to you the [^c]testimony of God. 







###### 2 



For I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ, and Him crucified. 







###### 3 



I also was with you in weakness and fear, and in great trembling, 







###### 4 



and my [^d]message and my preaching were not in persuasive words of [^e]wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, 







###### 5 



so that your faith would not [^f]rest on the [^g]wisdom of mankind, but on the power of God. 







###### 6 



Yet we do speak wisdom among those who are mature; a wisdom, however, not of this age nor of the rulers of this age, who are passing away; 







###### 7 



but we speak God's wisdom in a mystery, the hidden _wisdom_ which God predestined before the ages to our glory; 







###### 8 



_the wisdom_ which none of the rulers of this age has understood; for if they had understood it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory; 







###### 9 



but just as it is written: "Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard, And _which_ have not entered the human heart, All that God has prepared for those who love Him." 







###### 10 



[^h]For to us God revealed _them_ through the Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God. 







###### 11 



For who among people knows the _thoughts_ of a person except the spirit of the person that is in him? So also the _thoughts_ of God no one knows, except the Spirit of God. 







###### 12 



Now we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may know the things freely given to us by God. 







###### 13 



We also speak these things, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, [^i]combining spiritual _thoughts_ with spiritual _words_. 







###### 14 



But [^j]a natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned. 







###### 15 



But the one who is spiritual discerns all things, yet he himself is [^k]discerned by no one. 







###### 16 



For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he will instruct Him? But we have the mind of Christ. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# 1 Corinthians 3

***








###### 1 



And I, brothers _and sisters_, could not speak to you as spiritual people, but _only_ as fleshly, as to infants in Christ. 







###### 2 



I gave you milk to drink, not solid food; for you were not yet able _to consume it_. But even now you are not yet able, 







###### 3 



for you are still fleshly. For since there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly, and are you not walking like _ordinary_ people? 







###### 4 



For when one person says, "I am [^a]with Paul," and another, "I _am_ [^b]with Apollos," are you not _ordinary_ people? 







###### 5 



What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, even as the Lord gave _opportunity_ to each one. 







###### 6 



I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing the growth. 







###### 7 



So then neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but God who causes the growth. 







###### 8 



Now the one who plants and the one who waters are one; but each will receive his own [^c]reward according to his own labor. 







###### 9 



For we are God's fellow workers; you are God's [^d]field, God's building. 







###### 10 



According to the grace of God which was given to me, like a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another is building on it. But each person must be careful how he builds on it. 







###### 11 



For no one can lay a foundation other than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. 







###### 12 



Now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, _or_ straw, 







###### 13 



each one's work will become evident; for the day will show it because it is _to be_ revealed with fire, and the fire itself will test [^e]the quality of each one's work. 







###### 14 



If anyone's work which he has built on it remains, he will receive a reward. 







###### 15 



If anyone's work is burned up, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet _only_ so as through fire. 







###### 16 



Do you not know that you are a [^f]temple of God and _that_ the Spirit of God dwells in you? 







###### 17 



If anyone destroys the [^g]temple of God, God will destroy [^h]that person; for the [^i]temple of God is holy, [^j]and that is what you are. 







###### 18 



_Take care that_ no one deceives himself. If anyone among you thinks that he is wise in this age, he must become foolish, so that he may become wise. 







###### 19 



For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in the sight of God. For it is written: "_He is_ the one who catches the wise by their craftiness"; 







###### 20 



and again, "The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are useless." 







###### 21 



So then, no one is to be boasting in people. For all things belong to you, 







###### 22 



whether Paul or Apollos or [^k]Cephas, or the world or life or death, or things present or things to come; all things belong to you, 







###### 23 



and you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

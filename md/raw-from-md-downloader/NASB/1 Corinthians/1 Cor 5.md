# 1 Corinthians 5

***








###### 1 



It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and sexual immorality of such a kind as does not exist even among the Gentiles, _namely_, that someone has his father's wife. 







###### 2 



[^a]You have become [^b]arrogant and [^c]have not mourned instead, so that the one who had done this deed would be removed from your midst. 







###### 3 



For I, on my part, though absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged him who has so committed this, as though I were present. 







###### 4 



In the name of our Lord Jesus, when you are assembled, and [^d]I with you in spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus, 







###### 5 



_I have decided_ [^e]to turn such a person over to Satan for the destruction of his [^f]body, so that his spirit may be saved on the day of the [^g]Lord. 







###### 6 



Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little [^h]leaven leavens the whole lump _of dough_? 







###### 7 



Clean out the old leaven so that you may be a new lump, just as you are _in fact_ unleavened. For Christ our Passover also has been sacrificed. 







###### 8 



Therefore let's celebrate the feast, not with old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. 







###### 9 



I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people; 







###### 10 



I _did_ not at all _mean_ with the sexually immoral people of this world, or with the greedy and swindlers, or with idolaters, for then you would have to leave the world. 







###### 11 



But [^i]actually, I [^j]wrote to you not to associate [^k]with any so-called brother if he is a sexually immoral person, or a greedy person, or an idolater, or is verbally abusive, or habitually drunk, or a swindler--not even to eat with such a person. 







###### 12 



For what _business_ of mine _is it_ to judge outsiders? Do you not judge those who are within _the church_? 







###### 13 



But those who are outside, God [^l]judges. Remove the evil person from among yourselves. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

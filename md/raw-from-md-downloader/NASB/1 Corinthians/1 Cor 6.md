# 1 Corinthians 6

***








###### 1 



Does any one of you, when he has a [^a]case against [^b]his neighbor, dare to go to law before the unrighteous and not before the [^c]saints? 







###### 2 



Or do you not know that the [^d]saints will judge the world? If the world is judged by you, are you not competent _to form_ the smallest [^e]law courts? 







###### 3 



Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more matters of this life? 







###### 4 



So if you have law courts dealing with matters of this life, [^f]do you appoint them _as judges_ who are of no account in the church? 







###### 5 



I say _this_ to your shame. _Is it_ so, _that_ there is not among you anyone wise who will be able to decide between his brothers _and sisters_, 







###### 6 



but brother goes to law with brother, and that before unbelievers? 







###### 7 



Actually, then, it is already a defeat for you, that you have lawsuits with one another. Why not rather suffer the wrong? Why not rather be defrauded? 







###### 8 



On the contrary, you yourselves do wrong and defraud. And this to _your_ brothers _and sisters_! 







###### 9 



Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor [^g]homosexuals, 







###### 10 



nor thieves, nor _the_ greedy, nor those habitually drunk, nor verbal abusers, nor swindlers, will inherit the kingdom of God. 







###### 11 



Such were some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and [^h]in the Spirit of our God. ## The Body Is the Lord's 







###### 12 



All things are permitted for me, but not all things are of benefit. All things are permitted for me, but I will not be mastered by anything. 







###### 13 



Food is for the stomach and the stomach is for food, however God will do away with both [^i]of them. But the body is not for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord is for the body. 







###### 14 



Now God has not only raised the Lord, but will also raise us up through His power. 







###### 15 



Do you not know that your bodies are parts of Christ? Shall I then take away the parts of Christ and make them parts of a prostitute? [^j]Far from it! 







###### 16 



Or do you not know that the one who joins himself to a prostitute is one body _with her_? For He says, "The two shall become one flesh." 







###### 17 



But the one who joins himself to the Lord is one spirit _with Him_. 







###### 18 



Flee sexual immorality. Every other sin that a person commits is outside the body, but the [^k]sexually immoral person sins against his own body. 







###### 19 



Or do you not know that your body is a [^l]temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from [^m]God, and _that_ you are not your own? 







###### 20 



For you have been bought for a price: therefore glorify God in your body. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

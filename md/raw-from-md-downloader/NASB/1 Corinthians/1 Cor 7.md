# 1 Corinthians 7

***








###### 1 



Now concerning the things about which you wrote, it is good for a man [^a]not to touch a woman. 







###### 2 



But because of sexual immoralities, each man is to have his own wife, and each woman is to have her own husband. 







###### 3 



The husband must fulfill his duty to his wife, and likewise the wife also to her husband. 







###### 4 



The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband _does_; and likewise the husband also does not have authority over his own body, but the wife _does_. 







###### 5 



[^b]Stop depriving one another, except by agreement for a time so that you may devote yourselves to prayer, and [^c]come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. 







###### 6 



But this I say by way of concession, not of command. 







###### 7 



[^d]Yet I wish that all [^e]men were even as I myself am. However, each has his own gift from God, one in this way, and another in that. 







###### 8 



But I say to the unmarried and to widows that it is good for them if they remain even as I. 







###### 9 



But if they do not have self-control, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to burn _with passion_. 







###### 10 



But to the married I give instructions, not I, but the Lord, that the wife is not to leave her husband 







###### 11 



(but if she does leave, she must remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband), and that the husband is not to [^f]divorce his wife. 







###### 12 



But to the rest I say, not the Lord, that if any brother has an unbelieving wife, and she consents to live with him, he must not [^g]divorce her. 







###### 13 



And [^h]if any woman has an unbelieving husband, and he consents to live with her, she must not [^i]divorce her husband. 







###### 14 



For the unbelieving husband is sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified through [^j]her believing husband; for otherwise your children are unclean, but now they are holy. 







###### 15 



Yet if the unbelieving one is leaving, [^k]let him leave; the brother or the sister is not under bondage in such _cases_, but God has called [^l]us in peace. 







###### 16 



For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife? 







###### 17 



Only, as the Lord has assigned to each one, as God has called each, in this way let him walk. And so I direct in all the churches. 







###### 18 



Was any man called _when he was already_ circumcised? He is not to become uncircumcised. Has anyone been called in uncircumcision? He is not to be circumcised. 







###### 19 



Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but _what matters is_ the keeping of the commandments of God. 







###### 20 



Each _person_ is to remain in that [^m]state in which he was called. 







###### 21 



Were you called as a slave? Do not let it concern you. But if you are also able to become free, take advantage of _that_. 







###### 22 



For the one who was called in the Lord as a slave, is the Lord's freed person; likewise the one who was called as free, is Christ's slave. 







###### 23 



You were bought for a price; do not become slaves of people. 







###### 24 



Brothers _and sisters_, each one is to remain with God in that _condition_ in which he was called. 







###### 25 



Now concerning virgins, I have no command of the Lord, but I am offering direction as one who [^n]by the mercy of the Lord is trustworthy. 







###### 26 



I think, then, that this is good in view of the [^o]present distress, that it is good for a man [^p]to remain as he is. 







###### 27 



Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be released. Are you released from a wife? Do not seek a wife. 







###### 28 



But if you marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Yet such people _as yourselves_ will have [^q]trouble in this life, and I _am trying to_ spare you. 







###### 29 



But this I say, brothers, the time has been shortened, so that from now on those who have wives should be as though they had none; 







###### 30 



and those who weep, as though they did not weep; and those who rejoice, as though they did not rejoice; and those who buy, as though they did not possess; 







###### 31 



and those who use the world, as though they did not make full use of it; for the _present_ form of this world is passing away. 







###### 32 



But I want you to be free from concern. One who is unmarried is concerned about the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord; 







###### 33 



but one who is married is concerned about the things of the world, how he may please his wife, 







###### 34 



and _his interests_ are divided. The woman who is unmarried, and the virgin, is concerned about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and spirit; but one who is married is concerned about the things of the world, how she may please her husband. 







###### 35 



I say this for your own benefit, not to put a restraint on you, but [^r]to promote what is appropriate and _to secure_ undistracted devotion to the Lord. 







###### 36 



But if anyone thinks that he is acting dishonorably toward his virgin, if she is [^s]past her youth and it ought to be so, let him do what he wishes, he is not sinning; let [^t]them marry. 







###### 37 



But the one who stands firm in his heart, [^u]if he is not under constraint, but has authority [^v]over his own will, and has decided this in his own heart, to keep his own virgin, he will do well. 







###### 38 



So then, both the one who gives his own virgin in marriage does well, and the one who does not give _her_ in marriage will do better. 







###### 39 



A wife is bound as long as her husband lives; but if her husband [^w]dies, she is free to be married to whom she wishes, only in the Lord. 







###### 40 



But in my opinion she is [^x]happier if she remains as she is; and I think that I also have the Spirit of God. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

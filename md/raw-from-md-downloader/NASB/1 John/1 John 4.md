# 1 John 4

***








###### 1 



Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. 







###### 2 



By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God; 







###### 3 



and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God; this is the _spirit_ of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming, and now it is already in the world. 







###### 4 



You are from God, little children, and have overcome them; because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world. 







###### 5 



They are from the world, therefore they speak _as_ from the world, and the world listens to them. 







###### 6 



We are from God. The one who knows God listens to us; the one who is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error. ## God Is Love 







###### 7 



Beloved, let's love one another; for love is from God, and everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. 







###### 8 



The one who does not love does not know God, because God is love. 







###### 9 



By this the love of God was revealed [^a]in us, that God has sent His only Son into the world so that we may live through Him. 







###### 10 



In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son _to be_ the [^b]propitiation for our sins. 







###### 11 



Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. 







###### 12 



No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God remains in us, and His love is perfected in us. 







###### 13 



By this we know that we remain in Him and He in us, because He has given to us of His Spirit. 







###### 14 



We have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son _to be_ the Savior of the world. 







###### 15 



Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God remains in him, and he in God. 







###### 16 



We have come to know and have believed the love which God has [^c]for us. God is love, and the one who remains in love remains in God, and God remains in him. 







###### 17 



By this, love is perfected with us, so that we may have confidence in the day of judgment; because as He is, we also are in this world. 







###### 18 



There is no fear in love, but perfect love drives out fear, because fear [^d]involves punishment, and the one who fears is not perfected in love. 







###### 19 



We love, because He first loved us. 







###### 20 



If someone says, "I love God," and _yet_ he hates his brother _or sister_, he is a liar; for the one who does not love his brother _and sister_ whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen. 







###### 21 



And this commandment we have from Him, that the one who loves God must also love his brother _and sister_. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

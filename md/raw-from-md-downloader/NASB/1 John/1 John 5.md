# 1 John 5

***








###### 1 



Everyone who believes that Jesus is the [^a]Christ has been born of God, and everyone who loves the [^b]Father loves the _child_ born of Him. 







###### 2 



By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and [^c]follow His commandments. 







###### 3 



For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments; and His commandments are not burdensome. 







###### 4 



For [^d]whoever has been born of God overcomes the world; and this is the victory that has overcome the world: our faith. 







###### 5 



Who is the one who overcomes the world, but the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God? 







###### 6 



This is the One who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ; not [^e]with the water only, but [^f]with the water and [^g]with the blood. It is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth. 







###### 7 



For there are three that testify: 







###### 8 



[^h]the Spirit and the water and the blood; and the three are [^i]in agreement. 







###### 9 



If we receive the testimony of people, the testimony of God is greater; for the testimony of God is this, that He has testified concerning His Son. 







###### 10 



The one who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself; the one who does not believe God has made Him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given concerning His Son. 







###### 11 



And the testimony is this, that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. 







###### 12 



The one who has the Son has the life; the one who does not have the Son of God does not have the life. ## This Is Written That You May Know 







###### 13 



These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have eternal life. 







###### 14 



This is the confidence which we have [^j]before Him, that, if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us. 







###### 15 



And if we know that He hears us _in_ whatever we ask, we know that we have the requests which we have asked from Him. 







###### 16 



If anyone sees his brother _or sister_ [^k]committing a sin not _leading_ to death, he shall ask and [^l]_God_ will, for him, give life to those who commit sin not _leading_ to death. There is sin _leading_ to death; I am not saying that he should ask about that. 







###### 17 



All unrighteousness is sin, and there is sin not _leading_ to death. 







###### 18 



We know that no one who has been born of God [^m]sins; but He who was born of God keeps him, and the evil one does not touch him. 







###### 19 



We know that we are of God, and that the whole world lies in _the power of_ the evil one. 







###### 20 



And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us understanding so that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life.

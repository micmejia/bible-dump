# 1 Kings 4

***








###### 1 



Now King Solomon was king over all Israel. 







###### 2 



These were his officials: Azariah the son of Zadok _was_ the priest; 







###### 3 



Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha _were_ scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud _was_ the secretary; 







###### 4 



and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada _was_ over the army; and Zadok and Abiathar _were_ priests; 







###### 5 



and Azariah the son of Nathan _was_ over the deputies; and Zabud the son of Nathan, a priest, _was_ the king's confidant; 







###### 6 



and Ahishar was over the household; and Adoniram the son of Abda _was_ over the forced labor. 







###### 7 



Solomon had twelve deputies over all Israel, who provided food for the king and his household; each _deputy_ had to provide food for a month in the year. 







###### 8 



And these _were_ their names: Ben-hur, in the hill country of Ephraim; 







###### 9 



Ben-deker in Makaz and Shaalbim, and Beth-shemesh, and Elonbeth-hanan; 







###### 10 



Ben-hesed in Arubboth (Socoh _was_ his and all the land of Hepher); 







###### 11 



Ben-abinadab _in_ all [^a]the hills of Dor (Taphath the daughter of Solomon was his wife); 







###### 12 



Baana the son of Ahilud _in_ Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean which is beside Zarethan below Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah as far as the other side of Jokmeam; 







###### 13 



Ben-geber in Ramoth-gilead (the villages of Jair, the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead were his: the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, sixty great cities with walls and bronze bars _were_ his); 







###### 14 



Ahinadab the son of Iddo _in_ Mahanaim; 







###### 15 



Ahimaaz in Naphtali (he also married Basemath the daughter of Solomon); 







###### 16 



Baana the son of Hushai in Asher and [^b]Bealoth; 







###### 17 



Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah in Issachar; 







###### 18 



Shimei the son of Ela in Benjamin; 







###### 19 



Geber the son of Uri in the land of Gilead, the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan; and _he was_ the only deputy who _was_ in the land. ## Solomon's Power, Wealth, and Wisdom 







###### 20 



Judah and Israel _were_ as numerous as the sand that is on the [^c]seashore in abundance; _they_ were eating, drinking, and rejoicing. 







###### 21 



[^d]Now Solomon was ruling over all the kingdoms from the _Euphrates_ River _to_ the land of the Philistines and to the border of Egypt; _they_ brought tribute and served Solomon all the days of his life. 







###### 22 



Solomon's [^e]provision for one day was [^f]thirty kors of fine flour and [^g]sixty kors of meal, 







###### 23 



ten fat oxen, twenty [^h]pasture-fed oxen, and a hundred sheep, besides deer, gazelles, roebucks, and fattened geese. 







###### 24 



For he was ruling over everything [^i]west of the _Euphrates_ River, from Tiphsah even to Gaza, over all the kings [^j]west of the River; and he had peace on all sides surrounding him. 







###### 25 



So Judah and Israel lived securely, everyone under his vine and his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon. 







###### 26 



Solomon had [^k]forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. 







###### 27 



And those deputies provided food for King Solomon and all who came to King Solomon's table, each in his month; they allowed nothing to be lacking. 







###### 28 



They also brought barley and straw for the _war_ horses and baggage horses to the place where it was _required_, each _deputy_ according to his duty. 







###### 29 



Now God gave Solomon wisdom and very great discernment and breadth of [^l]mind, like the sand that is on the seashore. 







###### 30 



Solomon's wisdom surpassed the wisdom of all the [^m]people of the east and all the wisdom of Egypt. 







###### 31 



For he was wiser than all _other_ people, _more_ than Ethan the Ezrahite, Heman, Calcol, and [^n]Darda, the sons of Mahol; and his [^o]fame was _known_ in all the surrounding nations. 







###### 32 



He also told three thousand proverbs, and his songs _numbered_ 1,005. 







###### 33 



He told of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even to the hyssop that grows on the wall; he told also of animals, birds, crawling things, and fish. 







###### 34 



_People_ came from all the [^p]nations to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all the kings of the earth who had heard of his wisdom. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# 1 Kings 5

***








###### 1 



[^a]Now Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon when he heard that they had anointed him king in place of his father, for Hiram had [^b]always been a friend of David. 







###### 2 



Then Solomon sent _word_ to Hiram, saying, 







###### 3 



"You know that David my father was unable to build a house for the name of the LORD his God because of the wars which surrounded him, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet. 







###### 4 



But now the LORD my God has secured me rest on every side; there is neither adversary nor [^c]misfortune. 







###### 5 



So behold, I [^d]intend to build a house for the name of the LORD my God, just as the LORD spoke to David my father, saying, 'Your son, whom I will put on your throne in your place, he will build the house for My name.' 







###### 6 



Now then, issue orders that they cut cedars from Lebanon for me, and my servants will be with your servants; and I will give you wages for your servants in accordance with all that you say, for you yourself know that there is no one among us who knows how to cut timber like the Sidonians." 







###### 7 



When Hiram heard the words of Solomon, he greatly rejoiced; and he said, "Blessed be the LORD today, who has given to David a wise son over this great people." 







###### 8 



So Hiram sent _word_ to Solomon, saying, "I have heard _the message_ which you sent me; I will do everything you wish concerning the cedar and juniper timber. 







###### 9 



My servants will bring _the timbers_ down from Lebanon to the sea; and I will have them made into rafts _to go_ by sea to the place where you [^e]direct me, and I will have them broken up there, and you will carry _them_ away. Then you shall do what I wish, by giving food to my household." 







###### 10 



So [^f]Hiram [^g]gave Solomon all that he wished of the cedar and juniper timber. 







###### 11 



Solomon then gave [^h]Hiram [^i]twenty thousand kors of wheat as food for his household, and [^j]twenty kors of pure oil; this is what Solomon would give Hiram year by year. 







###### 12 



And the LORD gave wisdom to Solomon, just as He [^k]promised him; and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and the two of them made a covenant. ## Conscription of Laborers 







###### 13 



Now King Solomon [^l]conscripted forced laborers from all Israel; and the forced laborers _numbered_ thirty thousand men. 







###### 14 



Then he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month in shifts; they were in Lebanon for a month, _and_ two months at home. And Adoniram _was_ in charge of the forced laborers. 







###### 15 



Now Solomon had seventy thousand porters, and eighty thousand stonemasons in the mountains, 







###### 16 



besides Solomon's 3,300 chief deputies who _were_ in charge of the [^m]project _and_ ruled over the people who were doing the work. 







###### 17 



Then the king issued orders, and they quarried large stones, valuable stones, to lay the foundation of the house with cut stones. 







###### 18 



So Solomon's builders and [^n]Hiram's builders and the Gebalites [^o]cut _the stones_, and they prepared the timbers and the stones to build the house. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

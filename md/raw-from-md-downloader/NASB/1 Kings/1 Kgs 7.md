# 1 Kings 7

***








###### 1 



Now Solomon built his own house _over the course of_ thirteen years, and he finished all of his house. 







###### 2 



He built the house of the timber from Lebanon; its length was [^a]a hundred cubits, its width fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits, on four rows of cedar pillars with cedar beams on the pillars. 







###### 3 



And it was paneled with cedar above the side chambers which were on the forty-five pillars, fifteen _in each_ row. 







###### 4 



_There were artistic window_ frames _in_ three rows, and window was opposite window at three [^b]intervals. 







###### 5 



And all the doorways and doorposts _had_ squared _artistic_ frames, and window was opposite window at three [^c]intervals. 







###### 6 



Then he made the hall of pillars; its length was [^d]fifty cubits and its width thirty cubits, and a porch _was_ in front of them and pillars and a threshold in front of them. 







###### 7 



And he made the hall of the throne where he was to judge, the hall of judgment, and it was paneled with cedar from floor to floor. 







###### 8 



And his house where he was to live, the other courtyard inward from the hall, was of this _same_ workmanship. He also made a house like this hall for Pharaoh's daughter, whom Solomon had married. 







###### 9 



All of these were _made_ of valuable stones, of stone cut according to measure, sawed with saws, inside and outside; even from the foundation to the [^e]coping, and from the outside to the large courtyard. 







###### 10 



And the foundation was of valuable stones, large stones, stones of [^f]ten cubits and stones of eight cubits. 







###### 11 



And above were valuable stones, cut according to measure, and cedar. 







###### 12 



So the large courtyard all around _had_ three rows of cut stone and a row of cedar beams as well as the inner courtyard of the house of the LORD, and the porch of the house. ## Hiram's Work in the Temple 







###### 13 



Now King Solomon sent _word_ and had Hiram brought from Tyre. 







###### 14 



He was a widow's son from the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, an artisan in bronze; and he was filled with wisdom, skill, and knowledge for doing any work in bronze. So he came to King Solomon and performed all his work. 







###### 15 



He fashioned the two pillars of bronze; [^g]eighteen cubits was the height of [^h]each pillar, and a line of [^i]twelve cubits [^j]measured the circumference of both. 







###### 16 



He also made two capitals of cast bronze to put on the tops of the pillars; the height of the one capital was [^k]five cubits and the height of the other capital was [^l]five cubits. 







###### 17 



_There were_ lattices of latticework and wreaths of chainwork for the capitals which were on the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital and seven for the other capital. 







###### 18 



So he made the pillars, and two rows around on the one lattice to cover the capitals which were on the top of the pomegranates; and so he did for the other capital. 







###### 19 



The capitals which _were_ on the tops of the pillars in the porch were of lily design, four cubits. 







###### 20 



So _there were_ capitals on the two pillars, also above _and_ close to the [^m]rounded projection which was beside the lattice; and the pomegranates _totaled_ two hundred in rows around [^n]both capitals. 







###### 21 



And he set up the pillars at the porch of the [^o]main room: he set up the right pillar and named it [^p]Jachin, and he set up the left pillar and named it [^q]Boaz. 







###### 22 



On the top of the pillars was _the_ lily design. So the work of the pillars was finished. 







###### 23 



He also he made the [^r]Sea of cast _metal_ [^s]ten cubits from brim to brim, circular _in shape_, and its height was five cubits, and [^t]it was [^u]thirty cubits in circumference. 







###### 24 



Under its brim gourds _went_ around encircling it ten to a cubit, completely surrounding the Sea; the gourds were in two rows, cast [^v]with the rest. 







###### 25 



It was standing on twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east; and the Sea _was set_ on top of them, and all their rear parts _turned_ inward. 







###### 26 



And it was a [^w]hand width thick, and its brim was made like the brim of a cup, _like_ a lily blossom; it could hold [^x]two thousand baths. 







###### 27 



Then he made the ten stands of bronze; the length of each stand was [^y]four cubits, its width four cubits, and its height was three cubits. 







###### 28 



This was the design of the stands: they had borders, that is, borders between the crossbars, 







###### 29 



and on the borders which were between the crossbars _were_ lions, oxen, and cherubim; and on the crossbars there _was_ a pedestal above, and beneath the lions and oxen _were_ wreaths of hanging work. 







###### 30 



Now each stand had four bronze wheels with bronze axles, and its four feet had supports; beneath the basin _were_ cast supports with wreaths at each side. 







###### 31 



And its opening inside the crown at the top _was_ a [^z]cubit, and its opening _was_ round _like_ the design of a pedestal, a cubit and a half; and on its opening also _there were_ engravings, and their borders were square, not round. 







###### 32 



The four wheels _were_ underneath the borders, and the axles of the wheels _were_ on the stand. And the height of a wheel _was_ a cubit and a half. 







###### 33 



The workmanship of the wheels _was_ like the workmanship of a chariot wheel. Their axles, their rims, their spokes, and their hubs _were_ all cast. 







###### 34 



Now _there were_ four supports at the four corners of each stand; its supports _were_ part of the stand itself. 







###### 35 



And on the top of the stand _there was_ a circular _form_ [^aa]half a cubit high, and on the top of the stand its [^ab]stays and its borders _were_ part of it. 







###### 36 



And he engraved on the plates of its stays and on its borders cherubim, lions, and palm trees, as _there was_ clear space on each, with wreaths _all_ around. 







###### 37 



He made the ten stands like this: all of them had the [^ac]same casting, [^ad]same measure, _and_ [^ae]same form. 







###### 38 



And he made ten basins of bronze, [^af]each holding [^ag]forty baths; each basin _was_ [^ah]four cubits, _and_ on each of the ten stands _was_ one basin. 







###### 39 



Then he placed the stands, five on the right side of the house and five on the left side of the house; and he set the [^ai]Sea _of cast metal_ on the right side of the house eastward toward the south. 







###### 40 



Now Hiram made the basins and the shovels and the bowls. So Hiram finished doing all the work which he performed for King Solomon _in_ the house of the LORD: 







###### 41 



the two pillars and the _two_ bowls of the capitals which _were_ on the top of the two pillars, and the two lattices to cover the two bowls of the capitals which _were_ on the top of the pillars; 







###### 42 



and the four hundred pomegranates for the two lattices, two rows of pomegranates for each lattice to cover the two bowls of the capitals which _were_ on the tops of the pillars; 







###### 43 



and the ten stands with the ten basins on the stands; 







###### 44 



and the one [^aj]Sea and the twelve oxen under the Sea; 







###### 45 



and the buckets, the shovels, and the bowls; indeed, all these utensils which Hiram made for King Solomon _in_ the house of the LORD _were_ of polished bronze. 







###### 46 



The king had them cast in the plain of the Jordan, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan. 







###### 47 



However, Solomon left all the utensils _unweighed_, because _they were_ too many; the weight of the bronze could not be determined. 







###### 48 



Solomon also made all the furniture that _was in_ the house of the LORD: the golden altar and the golden table on which _was set_ the bread of the Presence; 







###### 49 



and the lampstands of pure gold, five on the right side and five on the left, in front of the inner sanctuary; and the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs, of gold; 







###### 50 



also the cups, the [^ak]shears, the bowls, the ladles, and the firepans, of pure gold; and the hinges _both_ for the doors of the inner house, the Most Holy Place, _and_ for the doors of the house, _that is_, for the main room, of gold. 







###### 51 



So all the work that King Solomon performed _in_ the house of the LORD was finished. And Solomon brought in the offerings vowed by his father David, the silver and the gold and the utensils, _and_ he put them in the treasuries of the house of the LORD. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

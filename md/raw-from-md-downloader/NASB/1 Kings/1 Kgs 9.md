# 1 Kings 9

***








###### 1 



Now it came about when Solomon had finished building the house of the LORD and the king's house, and all [^a]that Solomon desired to do, 







###### 2 



that the LORD appeared to Solomon a second time, as He had appeared to him at Gibeon. 







###### 3 



And the LORD said to him, "I have heard your prayer and your plea which you have offered before Me; I have consecrated this house which you have built, by putting My name there forever, and My eyes and My heart will be there [^b]always. 







###### 4 



As for you, if you walk before Me as your father David walked, in integrity of heart and honesty, acting in accordance with everything that I have commanded you, _and if_ you keep My statutes and My ordinances, 







###### 5 



then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever, just as I [^c]promised to your father David, saying, '[^d]You shall not be deprived of a man on the throne of Israel.' 







###### 6 



"But if you or your sons indeed turn away from following Me, and do not keep My commandments and My statutes which I have placed before you, but you go and serve other gods and worship them, 







###### 7 



then I will cut Israel off from the land which I have given them, and the house which I have consecrated for My name, I will [^e]expel from My sight. So Israel will become a saying and an object of derision among all peoples. 







###### 8 



And this house will become a heap of ruins; everyone who passes by it will be appalled and [^f]hiss and say, 'Why has the LORD done such a thing to this land and this house?' 







###### 9 



And they will say, 'Because they abandoned the LORD their God, who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and they [^g]adopted other gods and worshiped and served them, for that reason the LORD has brought all this adversity on them.'" ## Cities Given to Hiram 







###### 10 



Now it came about at the end of twenty years in which Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD and the king's house 







###### 11 



(Hiram king of Tyre had supplied Solomon with cedar and juniper timber and gold, [^h]satisfying all his desire), that King Solomon then gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee. 







###### 12 



So Hiram left Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him, and they [^i]did not please him. 







###### 13 



And he said, "What are these cities which you have given me, my brother?" So [^j]they have been called the land of [^k]Cabul to this day. 







###### 14 



And Hiram sent to the king [^l]120 talents of gold. 







###### 15 



Now this is the account of the forced labor which King Solomon conscripted to build the house of the LORD, his own house, the [^m]Millo, the wall of Jerusalem, Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer. 







###### 16 



_For_ Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up and overthrown Gezer and burned it with fire, and killed the Canaanites who lived in the city; and he had given it _as_ a dowry to his daughter, Solomon's wife. 







###### 17 



So Solomon rebuilt Gezer and the lower Beth-horon, 







###### 18 



and Baalath and Tamar in the wilderness, in the land _of Judah_, 







###### 19 



and all the storage cities which Solomon had, that is, the cities for [^n]his chariots and the cities for [^o]his horsemen, and [^p]everything that it pleased Solomon to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land [^q]under his rule. 







###### 20 



_As for_ all the people who were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of the sons of Israel, 







###### 21 



their descendants who were left after them in the land, whom the sons of Israel were unable to completely eliminate, from them Solomon conscripted forced laborers, _as they are_ to this day. 







###### 22 



But Solomon did not make slaves of the sons of Israel; for they were men of war, his servants, his commanders, his charioteers, his chariot commanders, and his horsemen. 







###### 23 



These _were_ the [^r]chief officers who _were_ in charge of Solomon's work, 550, who ruled over the people doing the work. 







###### 24 



As soon as Pharaoh's daughter came up from the city of David to her house which _Solomon_ had built for her, he then built the Millo. 







###### 25 



Now three times a year Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar which he had built for the LORD, burning incense with them _on the altar_ which _was_ before the LORD. So he finished the house. 







###### 26 



King Solomon also built a fleet of ships in Ezion-geber, which is near Eloth on the shore of the [^s]Red Sea, in the land of Edom. 







###### 27 



And Hiram sent his servants with the fleet, sailors who knew the sea, along with the servants of Solomon. 







###### 28 



And they went to Ophir and received [^t]420 talents of gold from there, and brought _it_ to King Solomon. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

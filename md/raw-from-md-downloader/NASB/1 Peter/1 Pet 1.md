# 1 Peter 1

***








###### 1 



Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who reside as strangers, scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, who are chosen 







###### 2 



according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by the sanctifying work of the Spirit, [^a]to obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with His blood: May grace and peace be multiplied to you. 







###### 3 



Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, 







###### 4 



to _obtain_ an inheritance _which is_ imperishable, undefiled, and will not fade away, reserved in heaven for you, 







###### 5 



who are protected by the power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in _the_ last time. 







###### 6 



In this you greatly rejoice, even though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been distressed by various [^b]trials, 







###### 7 



so that the [^c]proof of your faith, _being_ more precious than gold which perishes though tested by fire, may be found to result in praise, glory, and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ; 







###### 8 



and though you have not seen Him, you love Him, and though you do not see Him now, but believe in Him, you greatly rejoice with joy inexpressible and [^d]full of glory, 







###### 9 



obtaining as the outcome of your faith, the salvation of [^e]your souls. 







###### 10 



As to this salvation, the prophets who prophesied of the grace that _would come_ to you made careful searches and inquiries, 







###### 11 



[^f]seeking to know what person or time the Spirit of Christ within them was indicating as He predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories [^g]to follow. 







###### 12 



It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves, but you, in these things which now have been announced to you through those who preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven--things into which angels long to [^h]look. 







###### 13 



Therefore, [^i]prepare your minds for action, [^j]keep sober _in spirit_, set your hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. 







###### 14 



As [^k]obedient children, do not [^l]be conformed to the former lusts _which were yours_ in your ignorance, 







###### 15 



but [^m]like the Holy One who called you, [^n]be holy yourselves also in all _your_ behavior; 







###### 16 



because it is written: "You shall be holy, for I am holy." 







###### 17 



If you address as Father the One who impartially judges according to each one's work, conduct yourselves in fear during the time of your stay _on earth_; 







###### 18 



knowing that you were not [^o]redeemed with perishable things like silver or gold from your futile way of life inherited from your forefathers, 







###### 19 



but with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and spotless, _the blood_ of Christ. 







###### 20 



For He was foreknown before the foundation of the world, but has appeared [^p]in these last times for the sake of you 







###### 21 



who through Him are believers in God, who raised Him from the dead and gave Him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God. 







###### 22 



Since you have purified your souls in obedience to the truth for a sincere love of the brothers _and_ sisters, fervently love one another from [^q]the heart, 







###### 23 



for you have been born again not of seed which is perishable, but imperishable, _that is_, through the living and enduring word of God. 







###### 24 



For, "All flesh is like grass, And all its glory is like the flower of grass. The grass withers, And the flower falls off, 







###### 25 



But the word of the Lord endures forever." And this is the word which was [^r]preached to you. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

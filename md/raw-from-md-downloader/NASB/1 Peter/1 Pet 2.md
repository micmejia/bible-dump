# 1 Peter 2

***








###### 1 



Therefore, rid _yourselves_ of all [^a]malice and all deceit and [^b]hypocrisy and [^c]envy and all [^d]slander, 







###### 2 



and like newborn babies, long for the [^e]pure [^f]milk of the word, so that by it you may grow [^g]in respect to salvation, 







###### 3 



if you have tasted [^h]the kindness of the Lord. ## As Living Stones 







###### 4 



And coming to Him as to a living stone which has been rejected by people, but is [^i]choice and precious in the sight of God, 







###### 5 



you also, as living stones, [^j]are being built up as a spiritual house for a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices that are acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. 







###### 6 



For _this_ is contained in [^k]Scripture: "Behold, I am laying in Zion a choice stone, a precious cornerstone, And the one who believes in [^l]Him will not be [^m]put to shame." 







###### 7 



This precious value, then, is for you who believe; but for unbelievers, "A stone which the builders rejected, This became the [^n]chief cornerstone," 







###### 8 



and, "A stone of stumbling and a rock of offense"; _for_ they stumble because they are disobedient to the word, and to this they were also appointed. 







###### 9 



But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for _G__od's_ own possession, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light; 







###### 10 



for you once were not a people, but now you are the people of God; you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy. 







###### 11 



Beloved, I urge _you_ as foreigners and strangers to abstain from fleshly lusts, which wage war against the soul. 







###### 12 



Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles, so that in the thing in which they slander you as evildoers, they may [^o]because of your good deeds, as they observe _them_, glorify God on the day of [^p]visitation. ## Honor Authority 







###### 13 



Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every human institution, whether to a king as the one in authority, 







###### 14 



or to governors as sent [^q]by him for the punishment of evildoers and the praise of those who do right. 







###### 15 



For [^r]such is the will of God, that by doing right you silence the ignorance of foolish people. 







###### 16 



_Act_ as free people, and [^s]do not use your freedom as a [^t]covering for evil, but _use it_ as bond-servants of God. 







###### 17 



Honor all people, love the brotherhood, fear God, honor the [^u]king. 







###### 18 



Servants, be subject to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are good and gentle, but also to those who are [^v]harsh. 







###### 19 



For this _finds_ favor, if for the sake of conscience toward God a person endures [^w]grief when suffering unjustly. 







###### 20 



For what credit is there if, when you sin and are harshly treated, you endure it with patience? But if when you do what is right and suffer _for it_ you patiently endure it, this _finds_ favor with God. ## Christ Is Our Example 







###### 21 



For you have been called for this purpose, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you would follow in His steps, 







###### 22 



_H__e_ who committed no sin, nor was any deceit found in His mouth; 







###### 23 



[^x]and while being abusively insulted, He did not insult in return; while suffering, He did not threaten, but kept entrusting _Himself_ to Him who judges righteously; 







###### 24 



and He Himself [^y]brought our sins in His body up on the [^z]cross, so that we might die to [^aa]sin and live for righteousness; by His [^ab]wounds you were healed. 







###### 25 



For you were continually straying like sheep, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and [^ac]Guardian of your souls. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

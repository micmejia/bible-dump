# 1 Peter 3

***








###### 1 



In the same way, you wives, be subject to your own husbands so that even if any _of them_ are disobedient to the word, they may be won over without a word by the behavior of their wives, 







###### 2 



as they observe your pure [^a]and respectful behavior. 







###### 3 



Your adornment must not be _merely_ the external--braiding the hair, wearing gold _jewelry_, or putting on apparel; 







###### 4 



but _it should be_ the hidden person of the heart, with the imperishable _quality_ of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is precious in the sight of God. 







###### 5 



For in this way the holy women of former times, who hoped in God, also used to adorn themselves, being subject to their own husbands, 







###### 6 



just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord; and you have proved to be her children if you do what is right [^b]without being frightened by any fear. 







###### 7 



You husbands in the same way, live with _your wives_ in an understanding way, as with [^c]someone weaker, _since she is_ a woman; and show her honor as a fellow heir of the grace of life, so that your prayers will not be hindered. 







###### 8 



[^d]To sum up, all _of you_ be harmonious, sympathetic, [^e]loving, compassionate, _and_ humble; 







###### 9 



not returning evil for evil or insult for insult, but giving a blessing instead; for you were called for the very purpose that you would inherit a blessing. 







###### 10 



For, "The one who desires life, to love and see good days, Must keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit. 







###### 11 



He must turn away from evil and do good; He must seek peace and pursue it. 







###### 12 



For the eyes of the Lord are toward the righteous, And His ears attend to their prayer, But the face of the Lord is against evildoers." 







###### 13 



And who is [^f]there to harm you if you prove zealous for what is good? 







###### 14 



But even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness, you [^g]are blessed. And do not fear their [^h]intimidation, and do not be in dread, 







###### 15 



but [^i]sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, always _being_ ready to make a [^j]defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you, but with gentleness and respect; 







###### 16 



[^k]and keep a good conscience so that in the thing in which you are slandered, those who disparage your good behavior in Christ will be put to shame. 







###### 17 



For it is better, if [^l]God should will it _so_, that you suffer for doing what is right rather than for doing what is wrong. 







###### 18 



For Christ also [^m]suffered for sins once for all _time, the_ just for _the_ unjust, so that He might bring us to God, having been put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the [^n]spirit; 







###### 19 



in [^o]which He also went and made proclamation to the spirits in prison, 







###### 20 



who once were disobedient when the patience of God kept waiting in the days of Noah, during the construction of the ark, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through _the_ water. 







###### 21 



Corresponding to that, baptism now saves you--not the removal of dirt from the flesh, but an appeal to God [^p]for a good conscience--through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, 







###### 22 



who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, after angels and authorities and powers had been subjected to Him. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

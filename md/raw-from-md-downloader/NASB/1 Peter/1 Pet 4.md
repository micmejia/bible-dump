# 1 Peter 4

***








###### 1 



Therefore, since Christ has [^a]suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same purpose, because the one who has [^b]suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin, 







###### 2 



so as to live the rest of the time in the flesh no longer for human lusts, but for the will of God. 







###### 3 



For the time already past is sufficient _for you_ to have carried out the desire of the Gentiles, [^c]having pursued a course of indecent behavior, lusts, drunkenness, carousing, drinking parties, and wanton idolatries. 







###### 4 



In _all_ this, they are surprised that you do not run with _them_ in the same excesses of [^d]debauchery, and they slander _you_; 







###### 5 



but they will give an account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead. 







###### 6 



For the gospel has for this purpose been [^e]preached even to those who are dead, that though they are judged in the flesh as people, they may live in the spirit according to _the will of_ God. 







###### 7 



The end of all things [^f]is near; therefore, be of sound judgment and sober _spirit_ for the purpose of [^g]prayer. 







###### 8 



Above all, keep fervent in your love for one another, because love covers a multitude of sins. 







###### 9 



Be hospitable to one another without complaint. 







###### 10 



As each one has received a _special_ gift, employ it in serving one another as good stewards of the [^h]multifaceted grace of God. 







###### 11 



Whoever speaks _is to do so_ as _one who is speaking_ actual words of God; whoever serves _is to do so_ as _one who is serving_ [^i]by the strength which God supplies; so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belongs the glory and [^j]dominion forever and ever. Amen. ## Share the Sufferings of Christ 







###### 12 



Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal among you, which comes upon you for your testing, as though _something_ strange were happening to you; 







###### 13 



but to the degree that you share the sufferings of Christ, keep on rejoicing, so that at the revelation of His glory you may also rejoice and be overjoyed. 







###### 14 



If you are insulted [^k]for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory, and of God, rests upon you. 







###### 15 



Make sure that none of you suffers as a murderer, or thief, or evildoer, or a [^l]troublesome meddler; 







###### 16 



but if _anyone suffers_ as a Christian, he is not to be ashamed, but is to glorify God in this name. 







###### 17 



For _it is_ time for judgment to begin [^m]with the household of God; and if _it_ _begins_ [^n]with us first, what _will be_ the outcome for those who do not obey the gospel of God? 







###### 18 



And if it is with difficulty that the righteous is saved, [^o]what will become of the godless man and the sinner? 







###### 19 



Therefore, those also who suffer according to the will of God are to entrust their souls to a faithful Creator in doing what is right. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# 1 Peter 5

***








###### 1 



Therefore, I urge elders among you, as _your_ fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, _and_ one who is also a [^a]fellow partaker of the glory that is to be revealed: 







###### 2 



shepherd the flock of God among you, exercising oversight, not under compulsion but voluntarily, according to _the will of_ God; and not [^b]with greed but with eagerness; 







###### 3 



nor yet as domineering over [^c]those assigned to your care, but by [^d]proving to be [^e]examples to the flock. 







###### 4 



And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading [^f]crown of glory. 







###### 5 



You [^g]younger men, likewise, be subject to _your_ elders; and all of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because God is opposed to the proud, but He gives grace to the humble. 







###### 6 



Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, so that He may exalt you at the proper time, 







###### 7 



having cast all your anxiety on Him, because He cares about you. 







###### 8 



Be of sober _spirit_, be on the alert. Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour. 







###### 9 



[^h]So resist him, firm in _your_ faith, knowing that the same experiences of suffering are being accomplished by your [^i]brothers and sisters who are in the world. 







###### 10 



After you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace, who called you to His eternal glory in Christ, will Himself perfect, confirm, strengthen, _and_ establish _you_. 







###### 11 



To Him _be_ dominion forever and ever. Amen. 







###### 12 



Through Silvanus, our faithful brother [^j](for so I regard _him_), I have written to you briefly, [^k]exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Stand firm in it! 







###### 13 



She who is in Babylon, chosen together with _you_, sends you greetings, and _so does_ my son, Mark. 







###### 14 



Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace be to you all who are in Christ. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

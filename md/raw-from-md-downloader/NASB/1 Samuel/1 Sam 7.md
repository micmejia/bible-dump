# 1 Samuel 7

***








###### 1 



And the men of Kiriath-jearim came and took the ark of the LORD and brought it into the house of Abinadab on the hill, and they [^a]consecrated his son Eleazar to watch over the ark of the LORD. 







###### 2 



From the day that the ark remained at Kiriath-jearim, the [^b]time was long, for it was twenty years; and all the house of Israel [^c]mourned after the LORD. 







###### 3 



Then Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, "If you are returning to the LORD with all your heart, then remove the foreign gods and the Ashtaroth from among you, and direct your hearts to the LORD and serve Him alone; and He will save you from the hand of the Philistines." 







###### 4 



So the sons of Israel removed the Baals and the Ashtaroth, and served the LORD alone. 







###### 5 



Then Samuel said, "Gather all Israel to Mizpah and I will pray to the LORD for you." 







###### 6 



So they gathered to Mizpah, and drew water and poured it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day and said there, "We have sinned against the LORD." And Samuel judged the sons of Israel at Mizpah. 







###### 7 



Now when the Philistines heard that the sons of Israel had gathered at Mizpah, the governors of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the sons of Israel heard _about it_, they were afraid of the Philistines. 







###### 8 



So the sons of Israel said to Samuel, "Do not stop crying out to the LORD our God for us, that He will save us from the hand of the Philistines!" 







###### 9 



Samuel took a nursing lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the LORD; and Samuel cried out to the LORD for Israel, and the LORD answered him. 







###### 10 



Now Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, and the Philistines advanced to battle Israel. But the LORD thundered with a great [^d]thunder on that day against the Philistines and confused them, so that they were struck down before Israel. 







###### 11 



And the men of Israel came out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, and killed them as far as below Beth-car. 







###### 12 



Then Samuel took a stone and placed it between Mizpah and Shen, and named it [^e]Ebenezer, saying, "[^f]So far the LORD has helped us." 







###### 13 



So the Philistines were subdued, and they did not come anymore within the border of Israel. And the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel. 







###### 14 



The cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even to Gath; and Israel [^g]recovered their territory from the hand of the Philistines. So there was peace between Israel and the Amorites. ## Samuel's Ministry 







###### 15 



Now Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life. 







###### 16 



And he used to go annually on a circuit to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah, and he judged Israel in all these places. 







###### 17 



Then _he would make_ his return to Ramah, because his house _was_ there, and there he _also_ judged Israel; and there he built an altar to the LORD. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

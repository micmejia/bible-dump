# 1 Thessalonians 1

***








###### 1 



Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace. 







###### 2 



We always give thanks to God for all of you, making mention _of you_ in our prayers; 







###### 3 



constantly keeping in mind your work of faith and labor of love and [^a]perseverance of hope [^b]in our Lord Jesus Christ in the presence of our God and Father, 







###### 4 



knowing, brothers _and sisters_, beloved by God, _His_ choice of you; 







###### 5 



for our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction; just as you know what kind of men we proved to be among you for your sakes. 







###### 6 



You also became imitators of us and of the Lord, having received the word during great affliction with the joy of the Holy Spirit, 







###### 7 



so that you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia. 







###### 8 



For the word of the Lord has sounded forth from you, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place _the news of_ your faith toward God has gone out, so that we have no need to say anything. 







###### 9 



For they themselves report about us [^c]as to the kind of reception we had with you, and how you turned to God from [^d]idols to serve [^e]a living and true God, 







###### 10 



and to wait for His Son from [^f]heaven, whom He raised from the dead, _that is_, Jesus who rescues us from the wrath to come. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

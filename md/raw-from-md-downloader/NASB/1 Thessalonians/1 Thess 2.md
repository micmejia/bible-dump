# 1 Thessalonians 2

***








###### 1 



For you yourselves know, brothers _and sisters_, that our [^a]reception among you was not in vain, 







###### 2 



but after we had already suffered and been treated abusively in Philippi, as you know, we had the boldness in our God to speak to you the gospel of God [^b]amid much [^c]opposition. 







###### 3 



For our exhortation does not _come_ from error or impurity or [^d]by way of deceit; 







###### 4 



but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not intending to please people, but _to please_ God, who [^e]examines our hearts. 







###### 5 



For we never came [^f]with flattering speech, as you know, nor with a pretext [^g]for greed--God is _our_ witness-- 







###### 6 



nor did we seek honor from people, either from you or from others, though [^h]we could have [^i]asserted our authority as apostles of Christ. 







###### 7 



But we [^j]proved to be [^k]gentle [^l]among you. As a nursing _mother_ [^m]tenderly cares for her own children, 







###### 8 



in the same way we had a fond affection for you and were delighted to share with you not only the gospel of God, but also our own [^n]lives, because you had become [^o]very dear to us. 







###### 9 



For you recall, brothers _and sisters_, our labor and hardship: _it was by_ working night and day so as not to be a burden to any of you, _that_ we proclaimed to you the gospel of God. 







###### 10 



You are witnesses, and _so is_ God, _of_ how devoutly and rightly and blamelessly we [^p]behaved toward you [^q]believers; 







###### 11 



just as you know how _we were_ exhorting and encouraging and imploring each one of you as a father _would_ his own children, 







###### 12 



so that you would walk in a manner worthy of the God who calls you into His own kingdom and glory. 







###### 13 



For this reason we also constantly thank God that when you received the word of God which you heard from us, you accepted _it_ not _as_ the word of _mere_ men, but as what it really is, the word of God, which also is at work in you who believe. 







###### 14 



For you, brothers _and sisters_, became imitators of the churches of God in Christ Jesus that are in Judea, for you also endured the same sufferings at the hands of your own countrymen, even as they _did_ from the Jews, 







###### 15 



who both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and [^r]drove us out. [^s]They are not pleasing to God, [^t]but hostile to all people, 







###### 16 



hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved; with the result that they always [^u]reach the limit of their sins. But wrath has come upon them [^v]fully. 







###### 17 



But we, brothers _and sisters_, having been orphaned from you _by absence_ for a [^w]short while--in [^x]person, not in [^y]spirit--were all the more eager with great desire to see your face. 







###### 18 



[^z]For we wanted to come to you--I, Paul, [^aa]more than once--and Satan hindered us. 







###### 19 



For who _is_ our hope, or joy or crown of pride, in the presence of our Lord Jesus at His [^ab]coming? Or _is it_ not indeed you? 







###### 20 



For you are our glory and joy. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

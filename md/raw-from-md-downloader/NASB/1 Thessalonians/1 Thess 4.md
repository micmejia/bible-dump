# 1 Thessalonians 4

***








###### 1 



Finally then, brothers _and sisters_, we request and urge you in the Lord Jesus, that as you received _instruction_ from us as to how you ought to [^a]walk and please God (just as you actually do [^b]walk), that you excel _even_ more. 







###### 2 



For you know what instructions we gave you [^c]by _the authority of_ the Lord Jesus. 







###### 3 



For this is the will of God, your sanctification; _that is_, that you abstain from sexual immorality; 







###### 4 



that each of you know how to [^d]possess his own [^e]vessel in sanctification and honor, 







###### 5 



not in [^f]lustful passion, like the Gentiles who do not know God; 







###### 6 



_and_ that no one violate the rights and take advantage of his brother _or sister_ in the matter, because the Lord is _the_ avenger in all these things, just as we also told you previously and solemnly warned _you_. 







###### 7 



For God has not called us for [^g]impurity, but in sanctification. 







###### 8 



Therefore, the one who rejects _this_ is not rejecting man, but the God who gives His Holy Spirit to you. 







###### 9 



Now as to the love of the brothers _and_ sisters, you have no need for _anyone_ to write to you, for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another; 







###### 10 



for indeed you practice it toward all the brothers _and sisters_ who are in all Macedonia. But we urge you, brothers _and sisters_, to excel _even_ more, 







###### 11 



and to make it your ambition to lead a quiet life and attend to your own _business_ and work with your hands, just as we instructed you, 







###### 12 



so that you will [^h]behave properly toward outsiders and [^i]not be in any need. ## Those Who Died in Christ 







###### 13 



But we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers _and sisters_, about those who [^j]are asleep, so that you will not grieve as indeed the rest _of mankind do_, who have no hope. 







###### 14 



For if we believe that Jesus died and rose _from the dead_, so also God will bring with Him those who have fallen asleep [^k]through Jesus. 







###### 15 



For we say this to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive [^l]and remain until the coming of the Lord will not precede those who have fallen asleep. 







###### 16 



For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a [^m]shout, with the voice of _the_ archangel and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. 







###### 17 



Then we who are alive, who remain, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord. 







###### 18 



Therefore, [^n]comfort one another with these words. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

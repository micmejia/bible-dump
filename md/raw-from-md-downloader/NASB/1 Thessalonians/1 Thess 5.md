# 1 Thessalonians 5

***








###### 1 



Now as to the periods and [^a]times, brothers _and sisters_, you have no need _of anything_ to be written to you. 







###### 2 



For you yourselves know full well that the day of the Lord is coming just like a thief in the night. 







###### 3 



While they are saying, "Peace and safety!" then sudden destruction [^b]will come upon them like labor pains upon a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. 







###### 4 



But you, brothers _and sisters_, are not in darkness, so that the day would overtake you [^c]like a thief; 







###### 5 



for you are all sons of light and sons of day. We are not of night nor of darkness; 







###### 6 



so then, let's not sleep as [^d]others do, but let's be alert and [^e]sober. 







###### 7 



For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who are drunk, get drunk at night. 







###### 8 



But since we are of _the_ day, let's be [^f]sober, having put on the breastplate of faith and love, and as a helmet, the hope of salvation. 







###### 9 



For God has not destined us for wrath, but for obtaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, 







###### 10 



who died for us, so that whether we are awake or asleep, we will live together with Him. 







###### 11 



Therefore, [^g]encourage one another and build one another up, just as you also are doing. ## Christian Conduct 







###### 12 



But we ask you, brothers _and sisters_, to recognize those who diligently labor among you and [^h]are in leadership over you in the Lord, and give you [^i]instruction, 







###### 13 



and that you regard them very highly in love because of their work. Live in peace with one another. 







###### 14 



We urge you, brothers _and sisters_, admonish the [^j]unruly, encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with everyone. 







###### 15 



See that no one repays another with evil for evil, but always seek what is good for one another and for all people. 







###### 16 



Rejoice always, 







###### 17 



pray without ceasing, 







###### 18 



in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God for you in Christ Jesus. 







###### 19 



Do not quench the Spirit, 







###### 20 



do not utterly reject [^k]prophecies, 







###### 21 



but examine everything; hold firmly to that which is good, 







###### 22 



abstain from every [^l]form of evil. 







###### 23 



Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you entirely; and may your spirit and soul and body be kept complete, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 







###### 24 



Faithful is He who calls you, and He also will do it. 







###### 25 



Brothers _and sisters_, pray for us[^m]. 







###### 26 



Greet all the brothers _and sisters_ with a holy kiss. 







###### 27 



I put you under oath by the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers _and sisters_. 







###### 28 



_May_ the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ _be_ with you. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

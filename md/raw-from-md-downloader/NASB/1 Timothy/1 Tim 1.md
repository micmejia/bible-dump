# 1 Timothy 1

***








###### 1 



Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our Savior, and of Christ Jesus, _who is_ our hope, 







###### 2 



To Timothy, _my_ true [^a]son in _the_ faith: Grace, mercy, _and_ peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. 







###### 3 



Just as I urged you [^b]upon my departure for Macedonia, to remain on at Ephesus so that you would instruct certain people not to teach strange doctrines, 







###### 4 



nor to [^c]pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which give rise to useless speculation rather than _advance_ [^d]the plan of God, which is by faith, _so I urge you now_. 







###### 5 



But the goal of our [^e]instruction is love from a pure heart, _from_ a good conscience, and _from_ a sincere faith. 







###### 6 



Some people have strayed from these things and have turned aside to fruitless discussion, 







###### 7 



wanting to be teachers of the Law, even though they do not understand either what they are saying or the matters about which they make confident assertions. 







###### 8 



But we know that the Law is good, if one uses it lawfully, 







###### 9 



realizing the fact that law is not made for a righteous person but for those who are lawless and rebellious, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and worldly, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers, 







###### 10 



for the [^f]sexually immoral, homosexuals, [^g]slave traders, liars, perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound teaching, 







###### 11 



according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, with which I have been entrusted. ## Paul's Testimony 







###### 12 



I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has strengthened me, because He considered me faithful, putting me into service, 







###### 13 



even though I was previously a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent aggressor. Yet I was shown mercy because I acted ignorantly in unbelief; 







###### 14 



and the grace of our Lord was more than abundant, with the faith and love which are _found_ in Christ Jesus. 







###### 15 



It is a trustworthy statement, deserving full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, among whom I am foremost. 







###### 16 



Yet for this reason I found mercy, so that in me as the foremost _sinner_ Jesus Christ might demonstrate His perfect patience as an example for those [^h]who would believe in Him for eternal life. 







###### 17 



Now to the King [^i]eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, _be_ honor and glory [^j]forever and ever. Amen. 







###### 18 



This command I entrust to you, Timothy, _my_ [^k]son, in accordance with the prophecies previously made concerning you, that by them you fight the good fight, 







###### 19 



keeping faith and a good conscience, which some have rejected and suffered shipwreck in regard to [^l]their faith. 







###### 20 



[^m]Among these are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan, so that they will be taught not to blaspheme. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

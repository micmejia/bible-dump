# 1 Timothy 2

***








###### 1 



First of all, then, I urge that requests, prayers, intercession, _and_ thanksgiving be made in behalf of all people, 







###### 2 



for kings and all who are in [^a]authority, so that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and [^b]dignity. 







###### 3 



This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, 







###### 4 



who wants all people to be saved and to come to the [^c]knowledge of the truth. 







###### 5 



For there is one God, _and_ one mediator also between God and mankind, _the_ man Christ Jesus, 







###### 6 



who gave Himself as a ransom for all, the testimony [^d]_given_ at [^e]the proper time. 







###### 7 



For this I was appointed as a [^f]preacher and an apostle (I am telling the truth, I am not lying), as a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth. ## Instructions for Believers 







###### 8 



Therefore I want the men in every place to pray, lifting up holy hands, without anger and dispute. 







###### 9 



Likewise, _I want_ women to adorn themselves with proper clothing, [^g]modestly and discreetly, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or expensive apparel, 







###### 10 



but rather by means of good works, as is proper for women making a claim to godliness. 







###### 11 



A woman must quietly receive instruction with entire submissiveness. 







###### 12 



But I do not allow a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man, but to remain quiet. 







###### 13 



For _it was_ Adam _who_ was first [^h]created, _and_ then Eve. 







###### 14 



And _it was_ not Adam _who_ was deceived, but the woman was [^i]deceived and [^j]became a wrongdoer. 







###### 15 



But [^k]women will be [^l]preserved through [^m]childbirth--if they continue in faith, love, and sanctity, with moderation. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

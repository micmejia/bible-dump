# 1 Timothy 3

***








###### 1 



It is a trustworthy statement: if any man aspires to the office of [^a]overseer, _it is_ a fine work he desires _to do_. 







###### 2 



[^b]An overseer, then, must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, [^c]temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, skillful in teaching, 







###### 3 



not overindulging in wine, not [^d]a bully, but gentle, not contentious, free from the love of money. 







###### 4 



_He must be_ one who manages his own household well, keeping his children under control with all dignity 







###### 5 



(but if a man does not know how to manage his own household, how will he take care of the church of God?), 







###### 6 



_and_ not a new convert, so that he will not become conceited and fall into condemnation [^e]incurred by the devil. 







###### 7 



And he must have a good reputation with those outside _the church_, so that he will not fall into [^f]disgrace and the snare of the devil. 







###### 8 



Deacons likewise _must be_ men of dignity, not [^g]insincere, not prone to _drink_ much wine, not greedy for money, 







###### 9 



_but_ holding to the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience. 







###### 10 



These men must also first be tested; then have them serve as deacons if they are beyond reproach. 







###### 11 



[^h]Women _must_ likewise _be_ dignified, not malicious gossips, but [^i]temperate, faithful in all things. 







###### 12 



Deacons must be husbands of one wife, _and_ [^j]good managers of _their_ children and their own households. 







###### 13 



For those who have served well as deacons obtain for themselves a [^k]high standing and great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus. 







###### 14 



I am writing these things to you, hoping to come to you before long; 







###### 15 



but [^l]in case I am delayed, _I write_ so that you will know how one should act in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and support of the truth. 







###### 16 



Beyond question, great is the mystery of godliness: He who was revealed in the flesh, Was [^m]vindicated [^n]in the Spirit, Seen by angels, Proclaimed among the nations, Believed on in the world, Taken up in glory. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

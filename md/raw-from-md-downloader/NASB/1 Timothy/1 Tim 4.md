# 1 Timothy 4

***








###### 1 



But the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will [^a]fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons, 







###### 2 



by means of the hypocrisy of liars seared in their own conscience as with a branding iron, 







###### 3 



who forbid marriage _and advocate_ abstaining from foods which God has created to be gratefully shared in by those who believe and know the truth. 







###### 4 



For everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with gratitude; 







###### 5 



for it is sanctified by means of the word of God and prayer. ## A Good Minister's Discipline 







###### 6 



In pointing out these things to the brothers _and sisters_, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, _constantly_ nourished on the words of the faith and of the good doctrine which you have been following. 







###### 7 



But [^b]stay away from worthless stories that are typical of old women. Rather, [^c]discipline yourself for the purpose of godliness; 







###### 8 



for bodily training is _just_ slightly beneficial, but godliness is beneficial for all things, since it holds promise for the present life and _also_ for the _life_ to come. 







###### 9 



It is a trustworthy statement deserving full acceptance. 







###### 10 



For it is for this we labor and strive, because we have set our hope on the living God, who is the Savior of all mankind, especially of believers. 







###### 11 



[^d]Prescribe and teach these things. 







###### 12 



Let no one look down on your youthfulness, but _rather_ in speech, conduct, love, faith, _and_ purity, show yourself an example [^e]of those who believe. 







###### 13 



Until I come, give your attention to the _public_ [^f]reading, to exhortation, _and_ teaching. 







###### 14 



Do not neglect the spiritual gift within you, which was granted to you through _words of_ prophecy with the laying on of hands by the [^g]council of elders. 







###### 15 



Take pains with these things; be _absorbed_ in them, so that your progress will be evident to all. 







###### 16 



Pay close attention to yourself and to the teaching; persevere in these things, for as you do this you will save both yourself and those who hear you. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

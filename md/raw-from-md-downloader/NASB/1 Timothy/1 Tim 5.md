# 1 Timothy 5

***








###### 1 



Do not sharply rebuke an older man, but _rather_ appeal to _him_ as a father, _and to_ the younger men as brothers, 







###### 2 



to the older women as mothers, _and_ to the younger women as sisters, in all purity. 







###### 3 



Honor widows who are actually widows; 







###### 4 



but if any widow has children or grandchildren, they must first learn to show proper respect for their own family and to give back compensation to their parents; for this is acceptable in the sight of God. 







###### 5 



Now she who is actually a widow and has been left alone has set her hope on God, and she continues in requests and prayers night and day. 







###### 6 



But she who indulges herself in luxury is dead, _even_ while she lives. 







###### 7 



[^a]Give these instructions as well, so that they may be above reproach. 







###### 8 



But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever. 







###### 9 



A widow is to be put on the list only if she is not less than sixty years old, _having been_ the wife of one man, 







###### 10 



having a reputation for good works; _and_ if she has brought up children, if she has shown hospitality to strangers, if she has washed the [^b]saints' feet, if she has assisted those in distress, _and_ if she has devoted herself to every good work. 







###### 11 



But refuse _to register_ younger widows, for when they feel physical desires alienating them from Christ, they want to get married, 







###### 12 



_thereby_ incurring condemnation, because they have [^c]ignored their previous pledge. 







###### 13 



At the same time they also learn _to be_ idle, as they go around from house to house; and not merely idle, but also _they become_ gossips and busybodies, talking about things not proper _to mention_. 







###### 14 



Therefore, I want younger _widows_ to get married, have children, manage their households, _and_ give the enemy no opportunity for reproach; 







###### 15 



for some have already turned away to follow Satan. 







###### 16 



If any woman who is a believer has _dependent_ widows, she must assist them and the church must not be burdened, so that it may assist those who are actually widows. ## Concerning Elders 







###### 17 



The elders who lead well are to be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who work hard [^d]at preaching and teaching. 







###### 18 



For the Scripture says, "You shall not muzzle the ox while it is threshing," and "The laborer is worthy of his wages." 







###### 19 



Do not accept an accusation against an elder except on the basis of two or three witnesses. 







###### 20 



Those who continue in sin, rebuke in the presence of all, so that the rest also will be fearful _of sinning_. 







###### 21 



I solemnly exhort you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of _His_ chosen angels, to maintain these _principles_ without bias, doing nothing in a _spirit of_ partiality. 







###### 22 



Do not lay hands upon anyone too quickly and [^e]thereby share _responsibility for_ the sins of others; keep yourself [^f]free from sin. 







###### 23 



Do not go on drinking only water, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments. 







###### 24 



The sins of some people are quite evident, going before them to judgment; for others, their _sins_ follow after. 







###### 25 



Likewise also, deeds that are good are quite evident, and those which are otherwise cannot be concealed. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# 1 Timothy 6

***








###### 1 



All who are under the yoke as slaves are to regard their own masters as worthy of all honor so that the name of God and _our_ doctrine will not be [^a]spoken against. 







###### 2 



Those who have believers as their masters must not be disrespectful to them because they are brothers _or sisters_, but must serve them all the more, because those who [^b]partake of the benefit are believers and beloved. Teach and [^c]preach these _principles_. 







###### 3 



If anyone advocates a different doctrine and does not [^d]agree with sound words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ, and with the doctrine conforming to godliness, 







###### 4 



he is conceited _and_ understands nothing; but he [^e]has a sick craving for controversial questions and disputes about words, from which come envy, strife, abusive language, evil suspicions, 







###### 5 



and constant friction between people of depraved mind and deprived of the truth, who suppose that [^f]godliness is a means of gain. 







###### 6 



But godliness _actually_ is a means of great gain _when_ accompanied by contentment. 







###### 7 



For we have brought nothing into the world, so we cannot take anything out of it, either. 







###### 8 



If we have food and [^g]covering, with these we shall be content. 







###### 9 



But those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap, and many foolish and harmful desires which plunge people into ruin and destruction. 







###### 10 



For the love of money is a root of all [^h]sorts of evil, and some by longing for it have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many [^i]griefs. 







###### 11 



But flee from these things, you man of God, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, [^j]perseverance, _and_ gentleness. 







###### 12 



Fight the good fight of faith; take hold of the eternal life to which you were called, and _for which_ you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses. 







###### 13 



I direct you in the presence of God, who [^k]gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who testified the good confession before Pontius Pilate, 







###### 14 



that you keep the commandment without [^l]fault _or_ reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, 







###### 15 



which He will [^m]bring about at _the_ proper time--He who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of [^n]kings and Lord of [^o]lords, 







###### 16 



who alone possesses immortality and dwells in unapproachable light, whom [^p]no one has seen or can see. To Him _be_ honor and eternal dominion! Amen. 







###### 17 



Instruct those who are rich in this present world not to be conceited or to set their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly supplies us with all things to enjoy. 







###### 18 



_Instruct them_ to do good, to be rich in good [^q]works, to be generous and ready to share, 







###### 19 



storing up for themselves the treasure of a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of that which is truly life. 







###### 20 



Timothy, protect what has been entrusted to you, avoiding worldly, empty chatter and the opposing arguments of what is falsely called "knowledge"-- 







###### 21 



which some have professed and _thereby_ have gone astray [^r]from the faith.

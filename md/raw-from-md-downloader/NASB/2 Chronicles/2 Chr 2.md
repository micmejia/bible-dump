# 2 Chronicles 2

***








###### 1 



[^a]Now Solomon [^b]decided to build a house for the name of the LORD, and a [^c]royal palace for himself. 







###### 2 



[^d]So Solomon [^e]assigned seventy thousand men to carry loads, eighty thousand men to quarry _stone_ in the mountains, and 3,600 to supervise them. 







###### 3 



Then Solomon sent _word_ to [^f]Huram the king of Tyre, saying, "As you dealt with my father David and sent him cedars to build him a house to live in, _do it for me_. 







###### 4 



Behold, I am about to build a house for the name of the LORD my God, dedicating it to Him, to burn fragrant incense before Him and _to set out_ the showbread continually, and to offer burnt offerings morning and evening, on Sabbaths, on new moons, and on the appointed feasts of the LORD our God. This _is to be done_ in Israel forever. 







###### 5 



The house which I am about to build _will be_ great, for our God is greater than all the gods. 







###### 6 



But who is able to build a house for Him, since the heavens and the highest heavens cannot contain Him? And who am I, that I should build a house for Him, except to [^g]burn _incense_ before Him? 







###### 7 



Now send me a skilled man to work in gold, silver, brass, iron, and in purple, crimson, and violet _fabrics_, one who knows how to make engravings, to _work_ with the skilled workers [^h]whom I have in Judah and Jerusalem, whom my father David provided. 







###### 8 



Send me also cedar, juniper, and algum timber from Lebanon, for I know that your servants know how to cut timber of Lebanon; and indeed my servants _will work_ with your servants, 







###### 9 



to prepare timber in abundance for me, for the house which I am about to build _will be_ great and wonderful. 







###### 10 



Now behold, I will give your servants, the woodsmen who cut the timber, [^i]twenty thousand kors of crushed wheat, twenty thousand kors of barley, [^j]twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil." ## Huram to Assist 







###### 11 



Then Huram, king of Tyre, [^k]answered in a letter sent to Solomon: "Because the LORD loves His people, He has made you king over them." 







###### 12 



Then Huram [^l]continued, "Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who made heaven and earth, who has given King David a wise son, [^m]endowed with discretion and understanding, who will build a house for the LORD and a [^n]royal palace for himself. 







###### 13 



"Now then, I am sending Huram-abi, a skilled man, [^o]endowed with understanding, 







###### 14 



the son of a [^p]Danite woman and [^q]a Tyrian father, who knows how to work in gold, silver, bronze, iron, stone, and wood, _and_ in purple, violet, linen, and crimson fabrics, and _who knows how_ to make all kinds of engravings and to [^r]execute any design which is assigned to him, _to work_ with your skilled workers and with [^s]those of my lord, your father David. 







###### 15 



Now then, let my lord send his servants wheat and barley, oil and wine, of which he has spoken. 







###### 16 



We will cut whatever timber you need from Lebanon and bring it to you as rafts by sea to Joppa, so that you may carry it up to Jerusalem." 







###### 17 



Solomon counted all the foreigners who _were_ in the land of Israel, following the [^t]census which his father David had [^u]taken; and 153,600 were found. 







###### 18 



He appointed seventy thousand of them to carry loads and eighty thousand to quarry _stones_ in the mountains, and 3,600 supervisors to make the people work. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

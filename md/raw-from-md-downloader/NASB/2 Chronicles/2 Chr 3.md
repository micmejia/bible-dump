# 2 Chronicles 3

***








###### 1 



Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where _the _Lord__ had appeared to his father David, at the place that David had prepared on the threshing floor of [^a]Ornan the Jebusite. 







###### 2 



He began to build on the second _day_ in the second month [^b]of the fourth year of his reign. ## Dimensions and Materials of the Temple 







###### 3 



Now these are the [^c]foundations which Solomon laid for building the house of God. The length in cubits, according to the old standard, _was_ [^d]sixty cubits, and the width, twenty cubits. 







###### 4 



The porch which was in front _of the house_ was as long as the width of the house, [^e]twenty cubits, and the height [^f]twenty; and inside he overlaid it with pure gold. 







###### 5 



He overlaid the [^g]main room with juniper wood and overlaid it with fine gold; and he [^h]ornamented it with palm trees and chains. 







###### 6 



Further, he overlaid the house [^i]with precious stones; and the gold was gold from Parvaim. 







###### 7 



He also overlaid the house with gold--the beams, the thresholds, and its walls and doors; and he carved cherubim on the walls. 







###### 8 



Then he made the [^j]room of the Most Holy Place: its length across the width of the house _was_ [^k]twenty cubits, and its width _was_ twenty cubits; and he overlaid it with fine gold, _amounting_ to [^l]six hundred talents. 







###### 9 



The weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. He also overlaid the upper rooms with gold. 







###### 10 



Then he made two [^m]sculptured cherubim in the room of the Most Holy Place and overlaid them with gold. 







###### 11 



The wingspan of the [^n]cherubim _was_ twenty [^o]cubits; the wing of one, of five cubits, touched the wall of the house, and _its_ other wing, of five cubits, touched the wing of the other cherub. 







###### 12 



The wing of the other cherub, of five cubits, touched the wall of the house; and _its_ other wing, of five cubits, was attached to the wing of the [^p]first cherub. 







###### 13 



The wings of these cherubim extended twenty cubits, and they stood on their feet [^q]facing the _main_ room. 







###### 14 



He made the veil of violet, purple, crimson, and fine linen, and he worked cherubim into it. 







###### 15 



He also made two pillars for the front of the house, thirty-five cubits [^r]high, and the capital on the top of each _was_ five cubits. 







###### 16 



He made chains in the inner sanctuary and placed _them_ on the tops of the pillars; and he made a hundred pomegranates and placed _them_ on the chains. 







###### 17 



He erected the pillars in front of the temple, one on the right and the other on the left, and named the one on the right Jachin and the one on the left Boaz. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

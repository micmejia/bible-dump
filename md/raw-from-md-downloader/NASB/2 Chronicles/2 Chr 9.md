# 2 Chronicles 9

***








###### 1 



Now when the queen of Sheba heard about the fame of Solomon, she came to Jerusalem to test Solomon with riddles. She had a very large entourage, with camels carrying balsam oil and a large amount of gold and precious stones; and when she came to Solomon, she spoke with him about everything that was on her heart. 







###### 2 



Solomon [^a]answered all her questions; nothing was hidden from Solomon which he did not [^b]explain to her. 







###### 3 



When the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, the house which he had built, 







###### 4 



the food at his table, the seating of his servants, the attendance of his ministers and their attire, his cupbearers and their attire, and [^c]his stairway by which he went up to the house of the LORD, she was breathless. 







###### 5 



Then she said to the king, "It was a true [^d]story that I heard in my own land about your words and your wisdom. 







###### 6 



But I did not believe their [^e]stories until I came and my _own_ eyes saw _it all_. And behold, not _even_ half of the greatness of your wisdom was reported to me. You have surpassed the report that I heard. 







###### 7 



How [^f]blessed are your men, how [^g]blessed are these servants of yours, who stand before you continually and hear your wisdom! 







###### 8 



Blessed be the LORD your God who delighted in you, setting you on His throne as king for the LORD your God; because your God loved Israel, establishing them forever, He made you king over them, to carry out justice and righteousness." 







###### 9 



Then she gave the king [^h]120 talents of gold and a very great _amount of_ balsam oil and precious stones; there had never been balsam oil like that which the queen of Sheba gave King Solomon. 







###### 10 



The servants of Huram and the servants of Solomon who brought gold from Ophir, also brought algum trees and precious stones. 







###### 11 



From the algum trees the king made steps to the house of the LORD and for the king's palace, and lyres and harps for the singers; and nothing like them was seen before in the land of Judah. 







###### 12 



King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba her every desire, whatever she requested, besides _gifts equal to_ what she had brought to the king. Then she turned and went to her own land with her servants. ## Solomon's Wealth and Power 







###### 13 



Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was [^i]666 talents of gold, 







###### 14 



besides _what_ the traders and merchants brought; and all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon. 







###### 15 



King Solomon made two hundred large shields of beaten gold, [^j]using six hundred _shekels of_ beaten gold on each large shield. 







###### 16 



_He made_ three hundred shields of beaten gold, [^k]using three hundred _shekels of_ gold on each shield; and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon. 







###### 17 



Moreover, the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold. 







###### 18 



_There were_ six steps to the throne and a footstool in gold attached to the throne, and [^l]arms [^m]on each side of the seat, and two lions standing beside the [^n]arms. 







###### 19 



Twelve lions were standing there on the six steps on the one side and on the other; nothing like _it_ was made for any _other_ kingdom. 







###### 20 



All King Solomon's drinking vessels _were_ of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon _were_ of pure gold; silver was not considered [^o]valuable in the days of Solomon. 







###### 21 



For the king had ships which went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram; once _every_ three years the ships of Tarshish came bringing gold and silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks. 







###### 22 



So King Solomon became greater than all the kings of the earth in wealth and wisdom. 







###### 23 



And all the kings of the earth were seeking the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom which God had put in his heart. 







###### 24 



They were bringing, each _of them_ his gift: articles of silver and gold, garments, weapons, balsam oil, horses, and mules, so much year by year. 







###### 25 



Now Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, and he stationed them in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem. 







###### 26 



He was ruler over all the kings from the _Euphrates_ River to the land of the Philistines, and as far as the border of Egypt. 







###### 27 



And the king made silver _as common_ as stones in Jerusalem, and he made cedars as plentiful as sycamore trees that are in the [^p]lowland. 







###### 28 



And they were bringing horses for Solomon from Egypt and from all countries. 







###### 29 



Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, _from_ the first to the last, are they not written in the [^q]records of Nathan the prophet, in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of [^r]Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat? 







###### 30 



Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel for forty years. ## Death of Solomon 







###### 31 



And Solomon [^s]lay down with his fathers and was buried in the city of his father David; and his son Rehoboam reigned in his place. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

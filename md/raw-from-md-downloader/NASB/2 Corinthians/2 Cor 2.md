# 2 Corinthians 2

***








###### 1 



But I decided this [^a]for my own sake, that I would not come to you in sorrow again. 







###### 2 



For if I cause you sorrow, who then _will be_ the one making me glad but the one who is made sorrowful by me? 







###### 3 



This is the very thing I wrote you, so that when I came, I would not have sorrow from those who ought to make me rejoice; having confidence in you all that my joy was _the joy_ of you all. 







###### 4 



For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears; not so that you would be made sorrowful, but that you might know the love which I have especially for you. 







###### 5 



But if anyone has caused sorrow, he has caused sorrow not for me, but in some degree--[^b]not to say too much--for all of you. 







###### 6 



Sufficient for such a person is this punishment which _was imposed_ by the majority, 







###### 7 



so that on the other hand, you should rather forgive and comfort _him_, otherwise such a person might be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow. 







###### 8 



Therefore I urge you to reaffirm _your_ love for him. 







###### 9 



For to this end I also wrote, so that I might [^c]put you to the test, whether you are obedient in all things. 







###### 10 



But one whom you forgive anything, I also _forgive_; for indeed what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, _I did so_ for your sakes in the presence of Christ, 







###### 11 



so that no advantage would be taken of us by Satan, for we are not ignorant of his schemes. 







###### 12 



Now when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ and when a door was opened for me in the Lord, 







###### 13 



I had no rest for my spirit, not finding Titus my brother; but saying goodbye to them, I went on to Macedonia. 







###### 14 



But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and through us reveals the fragrance of the knowledge of Him in every place. 







###### 15 



For we are a fragrance of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing: 







###### 16 



to the one an [^d]aroma from death to death, to the other an aroma from life to life. And who is adequate for these things? 







###### 17 



For we are not like the many, [^e]peddling the word of God, but as from sincerity, but as from God, we speak in Christ in the sight of God. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# 2 Corinthians 3

***








###### 1 



Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, as some, letters of commendation to you or from you? 







###### 2 



You are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read by all people, 







###### 3 



revealing yourselves, that you are a letter of Christ, [^a]delivered by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of [^b]human hearts. 







###### 4 



Such _is the_ confidence we have toward God through Christ. 







###### 5 



Not that we are adequate in ourselves _so as_ to consider anything as _having come_ from ourselves, but our adequacy is from God, 







###### 6 



who also made us adequate _as_ servants of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. 







###### 7 



But if the ministry of death, engraved in letters on stones, came [^c]with glory so that the sons of Israel could not look intently at the face of Moses because of the glory of his face, fading _as_ it was, 







###### 8 



how will the ministry of the Spirit fail to be _even_ more with glory? 







###### 9 



For if the ministry of condemnation has glory, much more does the ministry of righteousness excel in glory. 







###### 10 



For indeed what had glory in this case has no glory, because of the glory that surpasses _it_. 







###### 11 



For if that which fades away _was_ [^d]with glory, much more that which remains _is_ in glory. 







###### 12 



Therefore, having such a hope, we use great boldness in _our_ speech, 







###### 13 



and _we are_ not like Moses, _who_ used to put a veil over his face so that the sons of Israel would not stare at the end of what was fading away. 







###### 14 



But their minds were hardened; for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil [^e]remains unlifted, because it is removed in Christ. 







###### 15 



But to this day whenever Moses is read, a veil lies over their hearts; 







###### 16 



but whenever _someone_ turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away. 







###### 17 



Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, _there_ is freedom. 







###### 18 



But we all, with unveiled faces, looking as in a mirror at the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as from the Lord, the Spirit. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

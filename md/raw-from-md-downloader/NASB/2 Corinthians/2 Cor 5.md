# 2 Corinthians 5

***








###### 1 



For we know that if our [^a]earthly tent which is our house is torn down, we have a building from God, a house not made by hands, eternal in the heavens. 







###### 2 



For indeed, in this _tent_ we groan, longing to be clothed with our [^b]dwelling from heaven, 







###### 3 



since in fact after putting it on, we will not be found naked. 







###### 4 



For indeed, we who are in this tent groan, being burdened, because we do not want to be unclothed but to be clothed, so that what is mortal will be swallowed up by life. 







###### 5 



Now He who prepared us for this very _purpose is_ God, who gave us the Spirit as a [^c]pledge. 







###### 6 



Therefore, being always of good courage, and knowing that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord-- 







###### 7 



for we walk by faith, not by [^d]sight-- 







###### 8 



but we are of good courage and prefer rather to be absent from the body and to be at home with the Lord. 







###### 9 



Therefore we also have as our ambition, whether at home or absent, to be pleasing to Him. 







###### 10 



For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive compensation for [^e]his deeds _done_ through the body, in accordance with what he has done, whether good or bad. 







###### 11 



Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade people, but we are well known to God; and I hope that we are also well known in your consciences. 







###### 12 



We are not commending ourselves to you again, but _are_ giving you an opportunity to be proud of us, so that you will have _an answer_ for those who take pride in appearance and not in heart. 







###### 13 



For if we have lost our minds, _it is_ for God; if we are of sound mind, _it is_ for you. 







###### 14 



For the love of Christ controls us, having concluded this, that one died for all, therefore all died; 







###### 15 



and He died for all, so that those who live would no longer live for themselves, but for Him who died and rose on their behalf. 







###### 16 



Therefore from now on we recognize no one [^f]by the flesh; even though we have known Christ by the flesh, yet now we know _Him in this way_ no longer. 







###### 17 



Therefore if anyone is in Christ, _this person is_ a new [^g]creation; the old things passed away; behold, new things have come. 







###### 18 



Now all _these_ things are from God, who reconciled us to Himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation, 







###### 19 



namely, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not counting their wrongdoings against them, and [^h]He has [^i]committed to us the word of reconciliation. 







###### 20 



Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were making an appeal through us; we beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. 







###### 21 



He made Him who knew no sin _to be_ [^j]sin in our behalf, so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

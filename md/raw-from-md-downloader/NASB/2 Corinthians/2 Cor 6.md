# 2 Corinthians 6

***








###### 1 



And working together _with Him_, we also urge you not to receive the grace of God in vain-- 







###### 2 



for He says, "At a favorable time I listened to you, And on a day of salvation I helped you." Behold, now is "a favorable time," behold, now is "a day of salvation"-- 







###### 3 



giving no reason for _taking_ offense in anything, so that the ministry will not be discredited, 







###### 4 



but in everything commending ourselves as [^a]servants of God, in much endurance, in afflictions, in hardships, in difficulties, 







###### 5 



in beatings, in imprisonments, in [^b]mob attacks, in labors, in sleeplessness, in hunger, 







###### 6 



in purity, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in genuine love, 







###### 7 



in the word of truth, _and_ in the power of God; by the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and the left, 







###### 8 



by glory and dishonor, by evil report and good report; _regarded_ as deceivers and yet true; 







###### 9 



as unknown and _yet_ well known, as dying and _yet_ behold, we are alive; as [^c]punished and _yet_ not put to death, 







###### 10 



as sorrowful yet always rejoicing, as poor yet making many rich, as having nothing and _yet_ possessing all things. 







###### 11 



Our mouth [^d]has spoken freely to you, you Corinthians, our heart is opened wide. 







###### 12 



You are not restrained [^e]by us, but you are restrained in your own [^f]affections. 







###### 13 



Now in the same way in exchange--I am speaking as to children--open wide _your hearts to us_, you as well. 







###### 14 



Do not be [^g]mismatched with unbelievers; for what do righteousness and lawlessness share together, or what does light have in common with darkness? 







###### 15 



Or what harmony does Christ have with [^h]Belial, or [^i]what does a believer share with an unbeliever? 







###### 16 



Or what agreement does [^j]the temple of God have with idols? For we are [^k]the temple of the living God; just as God said, "I will dwell among them and walk among them; And I will be their God, and they shall be My people. 







###### 17 



Therefore, come out from their midst and be separate," says the Lord. "And do not touch what is unclean; And I will welcome you. 







###### 18 



And I will be a father to you, And you shall be sons and daughters to Me," Says the Lord Almighty. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# 2 Corinthians 9

***








###### 1 



For it is superfluous for me to write to you about this ministry to the [^a]saints; 







###### 2 



for I know your willingness, of which I boast about you to the Macedonians, _namely_, that Achaia has been prepared since last year, and your zeal has stirred up most of them. 







###### 3 



But I have sent the brothers, in order that our boasting about you may not prove empty in this case, so that, as I was saying, you will be prepared; 







###### 4 



otherwise, if _any_ Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we--not to mention you--would be put to shame by this confidence. 







###### 5 



So I considered it necessary to urge the brothers that they go on ahead to you and arrange in advance your previously promised [^b]generous gift, that the same would be ready as a [^c]generous gift, and not as _one grudgingly given due to_ greediness. 







###### 6 



Now _I say_ this: the one who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and the one who sows [^d]generously will also reap [^e]generously. 







###### 7 



Each one _must do_ just as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. 







###### 8 



And God is able to make all grace overflow to you, so that, always having all sufficiency in everything, you may have an abundance for every good deed; 







###### 9 



as it is written: "He scattered abroad, he gave to the poor, His righteousness [^f]endures forever." 







###### 10 



Now He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness; 







###### 11 



you will be enriched in everything for all liberality, which through us is producing thanksgiving to God. 







###### 12 



For the ministry of this service is not only fully supplying the needs of the [^g]saints, but is also overflowing through many thanksgivings to God. 







###### 13 



Because of the proof given by this ministry, they will glorify God for _your_ obedience to your confession of the gospel of Christ and for the liberality of your [^h]contribution to them and to all, 







###### 14 



while they also, by prayer on your behalf, yearn for you because of the surpassing grace of God in you. 







###### 15 



Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift! ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

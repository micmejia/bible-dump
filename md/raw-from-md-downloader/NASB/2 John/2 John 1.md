# 2 John 1

***








###### 1 



The elder to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth; and not only I, but also all who know the truth, 







###### 2 



because of the truth which remains in us and will be with us forever: 







###### 3 



Grace, mercy, _and_ peace will be with us, from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love. 







###### 4 



I was overjoyed to find _some_ of your children walking in truth, just as we have received a commandment _to do_ from the Father. 







###### 5 



Now I ask you, lady, not as though _I were_ writing to you a new commandment, but the one which we have had from the beginning, that we love one another. 







###### 6 



And this is love, that we walk according to His commandments. This is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, that you are to walk in it. 







###### 7 



For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ _as_ coming in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist. 







###### 8 



Watch yourselves, that you do not lose what we have accomplished, but _that_ you may receive a full reward. 







###### 9 



[^a]Anyone who [^b]goes too far and does not remain in the teaching of Christ, does not have God; the one who remains in the teaching has both the Father and the Son. 







###### 10 



If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into _your_ house, and do not [^c]give him a greeting; 







###### 11 



for the one who [^d]gives him a greeting [^e]participates in his evil deeds. 







###### 12 



Though I have many things to write to you, I do not want to _do so_ with paper and ink; but I hope to come to you and speak [^f]face to face, so that [^g]your joy may be made complete. 







###### 13 



The children of your chosen sister greet you. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

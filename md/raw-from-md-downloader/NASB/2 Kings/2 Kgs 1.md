# 2 Kings 1

***








###### 1 



Now Moab broke with Israel after the death of Ahab. 







###### 2 



And Ahaziah fell through the _window_ lattice in his upper chamber which _was_ in Samaria, and became ill. So he sent messengers and said to them, "Go, inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I will recover from this sickness." 







###### 3 



But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, "Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and say to them, 'Is it because there is no God in Israel _that_ you are going to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?' 







###### 4 



Now therefore, this is what the LORD says: '[^a]You will not get down from the bed upon which you have lain, but you shall certainly die.'" Then Elijah departed. 







###### 5 



When the messengers returned to [^b]Ahaziah, he said to them, "[^c]Why have you returned?" 







###### 6 



They said to him, "A man came up to meet us and said to us, 'Go, return to the king who sent you and say to him, "This is what the LORD says: 'Is it because there is no God in Israel _that_ you are sending _messengers_ to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore [^d]you will not get down from the bed upon which you have lain, but you shall certainly die.'"'" 







###### 7 



Then he said to them, "What [^e]did the man look like, who came up to meet you and spoke these words to you?" 







###### 8 



And they said to him, "_He was_ a hairy man with a leather [^f]belt worn around his waist." And he said, "It is Elijah the Tishbite." 







###### 9 



Then _the king_ sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty _men_. And he went up to him, and behold, he was sitting on the top of the hill. And he said to him, "You man of God, the king says, 'Come down.'" 







###### 10 



But Elijah replied to the captain of fifty, "If I am a man of God, may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty." Then fire came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty _men_. 







###### 11 



So _the king_ again sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty _men_. And he said to him, "You man of God, this is what the king says: 'Come down quickly!'" 







###### 12 



But Elijah replied to them, "If I am a man of God, may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty." Then the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty _men_. 







###### 13 



So _the king_ again sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty _men_. When the third captain of fifty went up, he came and bowed down on his knees before Elijah, and begged him and said to him, "You man of God, please let my life and the lives of these fifty servants of yours be precious in your sight. 







###### 14 



Behold, fire came down from heaven and consumed the first two captains of fifty with their fifties; but now let my [^g]life be precious in your sight." 







###### 15 



And the angel of the LORD said to Elijah, "Go down with him; do not be afraid of him." So he got up and went down with him to the king. 







###### 16 



Then he said to him, "This is what the LORD says: 'Since you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron--is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of His word? Therefore [^h]you will not get down from the bed upon which you have lain, but you shall certainly die.'" ## Jehoram Reigns over Israel 







###### 17 



So Ahaziah died in accordance with the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken. And since he had no son, Jehoram became king in his place in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah. 







###### 18 



Now _as for_ the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

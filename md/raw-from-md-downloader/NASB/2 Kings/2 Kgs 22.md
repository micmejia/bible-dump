# 2 Kings 22

***








###### 1 



Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned for thirty-one years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name _was_ Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath. 







###### 2 



He did what was right in the sight of the LORD and walked [^a]entirely in the way of his father David, and did not turn aside to the right or to the left. 







###### 3 



Now in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, the king sent Shaphan, the son of Azaliah the son of Meshullam the scribe, to the house of the LORD, saying, 







###### 4 



"Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, and have him [^b]count all the money brought into the house of the LORD, which the doorkeepers have collected from the people. 







###### 5 



And have them hand it over to the workmen who have the oversight of the house of the LORD, and have them give it to the workmen who are in the house of the LORD to repair the [^c]damage to the house: 







###### 6 



to the carpenters, the builders, the masons, and for buying timber and cut stone to repair the house. 







###### 7 



However, no accounting shall be made with them for the money handed over to them, because they deal honestly." ## The Lost Book 







###### 8 



Then Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, "I have found the Book of the Law in the house of the LORD." And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, who read it. 







###### 9 



Then Shaphan the scribe came to the king and brought back word to the king and said, "Your servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house, and have handed it over to the workmen who have the oversight of the house of the LORD." 







###### 10 



Moreover, Shaphan the scribe informed the king, saying, "Hilkiah the priest has given me a book." And Shaphan read it in the presence of the king. 







###### 11 



When the king heard the words of the Book of the Law, he tore his clothes. 







###### 12 



Then the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, [^d]Achbor the son of Micaiah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king's servant, saying, 







###### 13 



"Go, inquire of the LORD for me and for the people and all Judah concerning the words of this book that has been found, for the wrath of the LORD that burns against us is great, because our fathers did not listen to the words of this book, to act in accordance with everything that is written regarding us." ## Huldah Predicts 







###### 14 



So Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Achbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of [^e]Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe (and she lived in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter); and they spoke to her. 







###### 15 



Then she said to them, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel says: 'Tell the man who sent you to Me, 







###### 16 



"This is what the LORD says: 'Behold, I am going to bring disaster on this place and on its inhabitants, all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read. 







###### 17 



Since they have abandoned Me and have burned incense to other gods so that they may provoke Me to anger with all the work of their hands, My wrath burns against this place, and it shall not be quenched.'" 







###### 18 



But to the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of the LORD, this is what you shall say to him: "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel says: '_Regarding_ the words which you have heard, 







###### 19 



since your heart was tender and you humbled yourself before the LORD when you heard what I spoke against this place and against its inhabitants, that they would become an object of horror and a curse, and you have torn your clothes and wept before Me, I have indeed heard you,' declares the LORD." 







###### 20 



Therefore, behold, I am going to gather you to your fathers, and you will be gathered to your grave in peace, and your eyes will not look at all the devastation that I am going to bring on this place.'" So they brought back word to the king. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

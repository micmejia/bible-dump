# 2 Kings 5

***








###### 1 



Now Naaman, commander of the army of the king of Aram, was a great man [^a]in the view of his master, and eminent, because by him the LORD had given victory to Aram. The man was also a valiant warrior, _but_ afflicted with leprosy. 







###### 2 



Now the Arameans had gone out in bands and had taken captive a little girl from the land of Israel; and she [^b]waited on Naaman's wife. 







###### 3 



And she said to her mistress, "If only my master were [^c]with the prophet who is in Samaria! Then he would cure him of his leprosy." 







###### 4 



And [^d]Naaman went in and told his master, saying, "The girl who is from the land of Israel spoke such and such." 







###### 5 



Then the king of Aram said, "Go [^e]now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel." So he departed and took with him ten [^f]talents of silver, six thousand [^g]_shekels_ of gold, and ten changes of clothes. 







###### 6 



And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, [^h]which said, "And now as this letter comes to you, behold, I have sent Naaman my servant to you, so that you may cure him of his leprosy." 







###### 7 



But when the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes and said, "Am I God, to kill and to keep alive, that this man is sending _word_ to me to cure a man of his leprosy? But consider now, and see how he is seeking [^i]a quarrel against me." 







###### 8 



Now it happened, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, that he sent _word_ to the king, saying, "Why did you tear your clothes? Just have him come to me, and he shall learn that there is a prophet in Israel." 







###### 9 



So Naaman came with his horses and his chariots, and stood at the doorway of Elisha's house. 







###### 10 



And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, "Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh will be restored to you and _you will_ be clean." 







###### 11 



But Naaman was furious and went away, and he said, "Behold, I [^j]thought, 'He will certainly come out to me, and stand and call on the name of the LORD his God, and wave his hand over the site and cure the [^k]leprosy.' 







###### 12 



Are [^l]Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, not better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them and be clean?" So he turned and went away in a rage. 







###### 13 



Then his servants approached and spoke to him, [^m]saying, "My father, had the prophet told you _to do some_ great thing, would you not have done _it_? How much more _then_, when he says to you, 'Wash, and be clean'?" 







###### 14 



So he went down and dipped _himself_ in the Jordan seven times, in accordance with the word of the man of God; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean. ## Gehazi's Greed 







###### 15 



Then he returned to the man of God [^n]with all his company, and came and stood before him. And he said, "Behold now, I know that there is no God in all the earth, except in Israel; so please accept a [^o]gift from your servant now." 







###### 16 



But he said, "As _surely as_ the LORD lives, before whom I stand, I will accept nothing." And he urged him to accept _it_, but he refused. 







###### 17 



Then Naaman said, "If not, please let your servant be given two mules' load of earth; for your servant will no longer offer a burnt offering nor a sacrifice to other gods, but to the LORD. 







###### 18 



Regarding this matter may the LORD forgive your servant: when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand and I bow down in the house of Rimmon, when I bow down in the house of Rimmon, may the LORD please forgive your servant in this matter." 







###### 19 



He said to him, "Go in peace." So he went some distance from him. 







###### 20 



But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, [^p]thought, "Behold, my master has spared this Naaman the Aramean, [^q]by not accepting from his hand what he brought. As the LORD lives, I will run after him and take something from him." 







###### 21 



So Gehazi pursued Naaman. When Naaman saw _someone_ running after him, he came down from the chariot to meet him and said, "_Is everything_ well?" 







###### 22 



And he said, "_Everything is_ well. My master has sent me, saying, 'Behold, just now two young men of the sons of the prophets have come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver and two changes of clothes.'" 







###### 23 



Naaman said, "Be sure to take two talents." And he urged him, and tied up two talents of silver in two bags with two changes of clothes, and gave _them_ to two of his servants; and they carried _them_ before him. 







###### 24 



When he came to the [^r]hill, he took them from their hand and deposited them in the house, and he sent the men away, and they departed. 







###### 25 



But he went in and stood before his master. And Elisha said to him, "Where have you been, Gehazi?" And he said, "Your servant went nowhere." 







###### 26 



Then he said to him, "Did my heart not go _with you_, when the man turned from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to accept money and to accept clothes, olive groves, vineyards, sheep, oxen, and male and female slaves? 







###### 27 



Therefore, the leprosy of Naaman shall cling to you and to your [^s]descendants forever." So he went out from his presence afflicted with leprosy, _as white_ as snow. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# 2 Kings 7

***








###### 1 



Then Elisha said, "Listen to the word of the LORD; this is what the LORD says: 'About this time tomorrow a [^a]measure of fine flour _will be sold_ for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, at the gate of Samaria.'" 







###### 2 



The royal officer on whose hand the king was leaning responded to the man of God and said, "Even if the LORD were to make [^b]windows in heaven, could this thing happen?" Then he said, "Behold, you are going to see it with your own eyes, but you will not eat [^c]any of it." ## Four Men with Leprosy Report Arameans' Flight 







###### 3 



Now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate; and they said to one another, "Why are we sitting here until we die? 







###### 4 



If we say, 'We will enter the city,' then the famine is in the city and we will die there; but if we sit here, we will also die. Now then come, and let's go over to the camp of the Arameans. If they spare us, we will live; and if they kill us, then we will die." 







###### 5 



So they got up at twilight to go to the camp of the Arameans; when they came to the outskirts of the camp of the Arameans, behold, there was no one there. 







###### 6 



For the Lord had made the army of the Arameans hear a sound of chariots, a sound of horses, _that is_, the sound of a great army; and they said to one another, "Behold, the king of Israel has hired the kings of the Hittites and the kings of the Egyptians against us, to [^d]attack us!" 







###### 7 



So they got up and fled at twilight, and abandoned their tents, their horses, and their donkeys--_indeed_ the camp _itself_, just as it was; and they fled for their lives. 







###### 8 



When these men with leprosy came to the outskirts of the camp, they entered one tent and ate and drank, and carried from there silver, gold, and clothes, and they went and hid _them_; then they returned and entered another tent, and carried _valuables_ from there _also_, and went and hid _them_. 







###### 9 



Then they said to one another, "We are not doing the right thing. This day is a day of good news, but we are keeping silent _about it_; if we wait until the morning light, punishment will [^e]overtake us. Now then come, let's go and inform the king's household." 







###### 10 



So they came and called to the gatekeepers of the city, and told them, saying, "We came to the camp of the Arameans, and behold, there was no one there, nor a human voice; only the horses tied and the donkeys tied, and the tents just as they were." 







###### 11 



And the gatekeepers called and announced _it_ inside the king's house. 







###### 12 



Then the king got up in the night and said to his servants, "I will now tell you what the Arameans have done to us. They know that we are hungry; so they have left the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, 'When they come out of the city, we will capture them alive and get into the city.'" 







###### 13 



One of his servants responded and said, "Please, have some _men_ take five of the horses that remain, which are left [^f]in the city. Behold, they _will be in any case_ like all the multitude of Israel who are left in it; behold, they _will be_ like all the multitude of Israel who have _already_ perished, so let us send _them_ and see." 







###### 14 



Therefore they took two chariots with horses, and the king sent _them_ after the army of the Arameans, saying, "Go and see." ## The Promise Fulfilled 







###### 15 



They went after them to the Jordan, and behold, all the way was full of clothes and equipment which the Arameans had thrown away when they fled in a hurry. Then the messengers returned and informed the king. 







###### 16 



So the people went out and plundered the camp of the Arameans. Then a [^g]measure of fine flour _was sold_ for a shekel, and two [^h]measures of barley for a shekel, in accordance with the word of the LORD. 







###### 17 



Now the king appointed the royal officer on whose hand he leaned [^i]to be in charge of the gate; but the people trampled on him at the gate, and he died, just as the man of God had said, who spoke when the king came down to him. 







###### 18 



So it happened just as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, "Two [^j]measures of barley for a shekel and a [^k]measure of fine flour for a shekel, will be _sold_ about this time tomorrow at the gate of Samaria." 







###### 19 



_At that time_ the royal officer had responded to the man of God and said, "Now even if the LORD were to make windows in heaven, could such a thing as this happen?" And he had said, "Behold, you are going to see it with your own eyes, but you will not eat [^l]any of it." 







###### 20 



And this is what happened to him, for the people trampled on him at the gate and he died. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# 2 Kings 9

***








###### 1 



Now Elisha the prophet summoned one of the sons of the prophets and said to him, "[^a]Get ready and take this flask of oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth-gilead. 







###### 2 



When you arrive there, then look there for Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in and have him get up from among his brothers, and bring him to an inner room. 







###### 3 



Then take the flask of oil and pour it on his head, and say, 'This is what the LORD says: "I have anointed you king over Israel."' Then open the door and flee, and do not wait." 







###### 4 



So the young man, the servant of the prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead. 







###### 5 



When he arrived, behold, the commanders of the army were sitting, and he said, "I have a word for you, commander." And Jehu said, "[^b]For which _one_ of us?" And he said, "For you, commander." 







###### 6 



He then got up and went into the house, and _the prophet's servant_ poured the oil on his head and said to him, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel says: 'I have anointed you king over the people of the LORD, over Israel. 







###### 7 



And you shall strike the house of Ahab your master, so that I may avenge the blood of My servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel. 







###### 8 



For the entire house of Ahab shall perish, and I will eliminate from Ahab every male person both [^c]slave and free in Israel. 







###### 9 



I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah. 







###### 10 



The dogs will eat Jezebel in the territory of Jezreel, and no one will bury _her_.'" Then he opened the door and fled. 







###### 11 



Now Jehu went out to the servants of his master, and one said to him, "Is everything well? Why did this crazy fellow come to you?" And he said to them, "You know _very well_ the man and his talk." 







###### 12 



And they said, "It is a lie; tell us now." And he said, "Such and such he said to me, saying, 'This is what the LORD says: "I have anointed you king over Israel."'" 







###### 13 



Then they hurried, and each man took his garment and put it under him on the bare steps, and blew the trumpet, saying, "Jehu is king!" ## Jehu Assassinates Jehoram (Joram) 







###### 14 



So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. Now Joram [^d]with all Israel was [^e]defending Ramoth-gilead against Hazael king of Aram, 







###### 15 



but King [^f]Joram had returned to Jezreel to have himself healed of the wounds which the Arameans had [^g]inflicted on him when he fought Hazael king of Aram. So Jehu said _to the other men_, "If _this_ is your [^h]intent, _then_ let no [^i]one escape from the city to go tell _about it_ in Jezreel." 







###### 16 



Then Jehu rode in a chariot and went to Jezreel, since Joram was lying there _recovering_. And Ahaziah the king of Judah had come down to see Joram. 







###### 17 



Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel and he saw the [^j]company of Jehu as he came, and he said, "I see a [^k]company." And [^l]Joram said, "Take a horseman and send him to meet them and have him [^m]ask, 'Is _your intention_ peace?'" 







###### 18 



So a horseman went to meet him and said, "This is what the king says: 'Is _your intention_ peace?'" But Jehu said, "[^n]How is peace any business of yours? Turn _and_ follow me." And the watchman [^o]reported, "The messenger came to them, but he did not return." 







###### 19 



Then he sent a second horseman, and he came to them and said, "This is what the king says: 'Is _your intention_ peace?'" And Jehu [^p]answered, "[^q]How is peace any business of yours? Turn _and_ follow me." 







###### 20 



And the watchman [^r]reported, "He came up to them, but he did not return; and the [^s]driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi, for he drives furiously." 







###### 21 



Then [^t]Joram said, "[^u]Get ready." And they [^v]made his chariot ready. Then [^w]Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out to meet Jehu and found him on the [^x]property of Naboth the Jezreelite. 







###### 22 



When [^y]Joram saw Jehu, he said, "Is _your intention_ peace, Jehu?" And he [^z]answered, "What 'peace,' so long as your mother Jezebel's acts of prostitution and witchcraft are so many?" 







###### 23 



So [^aa]Joram [^ab]turned back and fled, and he said to Ahaziah, "_There is_ treachery, Ahaziah!" 







###### 24 



Then Jehu [^ac]drew his bow with his full strength and [^ad]shot [^ae]Joram between his arms; and the arrow went [^af]through his heart, and he sank in his chariot. 







###### 25 



And _Jehu_ said to Bidkar his officer, "Pick _him_ up and throw him on the [^ag]property of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite; for remember, _when_ [^ah]you and I were riding together after his father Ahab, that the LORD brought this pronouncement against him: 







###### 26 



'I have certainly seen yesterday the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons,' declares the LORD, 'and I will repay you on this [^ai]property,' declares the LORD. Now then, pick him up and throw him on the [^aj]property, in accordance with the word of the LORD." ## Jehu Assassinates Ahaziah 







###### 27 



When Ahaziah the king of Judah saw _this_, he fled by way of the garden house. But Jehu pursued him and said, "[^ak]Shoot him too, in the chariot." _So they shot him_ at the ascent of Gur, which is at Ibleam. But he fled to Megiddo and died there. 







###### 28 



Then his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his grave with his fathers in the city of David. 







###### 29 



Now in the eleventh year of Joram, the son of Ahab, Ahaziah became king over Judah. 







###### 30 



When Jehu came to Jezreel, Jezebel heard _about it_, and she put makeup on her eyes and adorned her head, and looked down through the window. 







###### 31 



As Jehu entered the gate, she said, "Is _your intention_ peace, Zimri, his master's murderer?" 







###### 32 



Then he raised his face toward the window and said, "Who is with me, who?" And two _or_ three officials looked down at him. ## Jezebel Is Killed 







###### 33 



Then he said, "Throw her down." So they threw her down, and some of her blood spattered on the wall and on the horses, and he trampled her underfoot. 







###### 34 



When he came in, he ate and drank; and he said, "See now to this cursed woman and bury her, for she is a king's daughter." 







###### 35 



So they went to bury her, but they found nothing of her except the skull, the feet, and the palms of her hands. 







###### 36 



Therefore they returned and informed him. And he said, "This is the word of the LORD, which He spoke by His servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, 'On the [^al]property of Jezreel the dogs shall eat the flesh of Jezebel; 







###### 37 



and the corpse of Jezebel will be like dung on the face of the field in the [^am]property of Jezreel, so they cannot say, "This is Jezebel."'" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

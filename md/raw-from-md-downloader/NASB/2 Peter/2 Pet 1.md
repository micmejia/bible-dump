# 2 Peter 1

***








###### 1 



[^a]Simon Peter, a bond-servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who have received a faith of the same [^b]kind as ours, [^c]by the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ: 







###### 2 



Grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus [^d]our Lord, 







###### 3 



for His divine power has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness, through the true knowledge of Him who called us [^e]by His own glory and [^f]excellence. 







###### 4 



Through [^g]these He has granted to us His precious and magnificent promises, so that by them you may become partakers of _the_ divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world on account of lust. 







###### 5 



Now for this very reason also, applying all diligence, in your faith supply moral [^h]excellence, and in _your_ moral excellence, knowledge, 







###### 6 



and in _your_ knowledge, self-control, and in _your_ self-control, perseverance, and in _your_ perseverance, godliness, 







###### 7 



and in _your_ godliness, brotherly kindness, and in _your_ brotherly kindness, love. 







###### 8 



For if these _qualities_ are yours and are increasing, they do not make you useless nor unproductive in the true knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. 







###### 9 



For the one who lacks these _qualities_ is blind _or_ short-sighted, having forgotten _his_ purification from his former sins. 







###### 10 



Therefore, brothers _and sisters_, be all the more diligent to make certain about His calling and choice of you; for as long as you practice these things, you will never stumble; 







###### 11 



for in this way the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be abundantly supplied to you. 







###### 12 



Therefore, I will always be ready to remind you of these things, even though you _already_ know _them_ and have been established in the truth which is present with _you_. 







###### 13 



I consider it right, as long as I am in this _earthly_ [^i]dwelling, to stir you up by way of reminder, 







###### 14 



knowing that the laying aside of my _earthly_ dwelling is imminent, as also our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me. 







###### 15 



And I will also be diligent that at any time after my departure you will be able to call these things to mind. ## Eyewitnesses 







###### 16 



For we did not follow cleverly devised tales when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of His majesty. 







###### 17 



For when He received honor and glory from God the Father, such a [^j]declaration as this was made to Him by the Majestic Glory: "This is [^k]My beloved Son with whom I am well pleased"-- 







###### 18 



and we ourselves heard this [^l]declaration made from heaven when we were with Him on the holy mountain. 







###### 19 



And _so_ we have the prophetic word _made_ more sure, to which you do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star arises in your hearts. 







###### 20 



_But_ know this first _of all_, that no prophecy of Scripture [^m]becomes _a matter_ of [^n]_someone's_ own interpretation, 







###### 21 



for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

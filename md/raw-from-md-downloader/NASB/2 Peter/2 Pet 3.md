# 2 Peter 3

***








###### 1 



Beloved, this is now the second letter I am writing to you in which I am stirring up your sincere mind by way of a reminder, 







###### 2 



to remember the words spoken beforehand by the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior _spoken_ by your apostles. ## The Coming Day of the Lord 







###### 3 



Know this first _of all_, that in the last days mockers will come with _their_ mocking, following after their own lusts, 







###### 4 



and saying, "Where is the promise of His coming? For _ever_ since the fathers [^a]fell asleep, all things continue just as _they were_ from the beginning of creation." 







###### 5 



For [^b]when they maintain this, it escapes their notice that by the word of God _the_ heavens existed long ago and _the_ earth was formed out of water and by water, 







###### 6 



through which the world at that time was destroyed by being flooded with water. 







###### 7 



But by His word the present heavens and earth are being reserved for fire, kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly people. 







###### 8 



But do not let this one _fact_ escape your notice, beloved, that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years like one day. 







###### 9 



The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not willing for any to perish, but for all to come to repentance. ## A New Heaven and Earth 







###### 10 



But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, in which the heavens will pass away with a roar and the elements will be destroyed with intense heat, and the earth and [^c]its works will be [^d]discovered. 







###### 11 



Since all these things are to be destroyed in this way, what sort of people ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness, 







###### 12 



looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be destroyed by burning, and the elements will melt with intense heat! 







###### 13 



But according to His promise we are looking for new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells. 







###### 14 



Therefore, beloved, since you look for these things, be diligent to be found spotless and blameless by Him, at peace, 







###### 15 



and regard the patience of our Lord _as_ salvation; just as also our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given him, wrote to you, 







###### 16 



as also in all _his_ letters, speaking in them of these things, in which there are some things that are hard to understand, which the untaught and unstable distort, as _they do_ also the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction. 







###### 17 



You therefore, beloved, knowing this beforehand, be on your guard so that you are not carried away by the error of [^e]unscrupulous people and lose your own [^f]firm commitment, 







###### 18 



but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him _be_ the glory, both now and to the day of eternity. Amen. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

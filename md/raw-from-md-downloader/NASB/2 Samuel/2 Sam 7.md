# 2 Samuel 7

***








###### 1 



Now it came about, when the king lived in his house, and the LORD had given him rest on every side from all his enemies, 







###### 2 



that the king said to Nathan the prophet, "See now, I live in a house of cedar, but the ark of God remains within the tent." 







###### 3 



Nathan said to the king, "Go, do all that is in your mind, for the LORD is with you." 







###### 4 



But in the same night, the word of the LORD came to Nathan, saying, 







###### 5 



"Go and say to My servant David, 'This is what the LORD says: "Should you build Me a house for My dwelling? 







###### 6 



For I have not dwelt in a house since the day I brought up the sons of Israel from Egypt, even to this day; rather, I have been moving about in a tent, that is, in a dwelling place. 







###### 7 



Wherever I have gone with all the sons of Israel, did I speak a word with one of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd My people Israel, saying, 'Why have you not built Me a house of cedar?'"' ## God's Covenant with David 







###### 8 



Now then, this is what you shall say to My servant David: 'This is what the LORD of armies says: "I Myself took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, to be leader over My people Israel. 







###### 9 



And I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have eliminated all your enemies from you; I will also make a great name for you, like the names of the great men who [^a]are on the earth. 







###### 10 



And I will establish a place for My people Israel, and will plant them, so that they may live in their own place and not be disturbed again, nor will [^b]malicious people oppress them anymore as previously, 







###### 11 



even from the day that I appointed judges over My people Israel; and I will give you rest from all your enemies. The LORD also declares to you that the LORD will make a house for you. 







###### 12 



When your days are finished and you [^c]lie down with your fathers, I will raise up your [^d]descendant after you, who will come from [^e]you, and I will establish his kingdom. 







###### 13 



He shall build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. 







###### 14 



I will be a father to him and he will be a son to Me; when he does wrong, I will discipline him with a rod of men and with strokes of sons of mankind, 







###### 15 



but My favor shall not depart from him, as I took _it_ away from Saul, whom I removed from you. 







###### 16 



Your house and your kingdom shall endure before [^f]Me forever; your throne shall be established forever."'" 







###### 17 



In accordance with all these words and all of this vision, so Nathan spoke to David. ## David's Prayer 







###### 18 



Then David the king came in and sat before the LORD, and he said, "Who _am_ I, Lord [^g]God, and who _are the members of_ my household, that You have brought me this far? 







###### 19 



And yet this was insignificant in Your eyes, Lord God, for You have spoken also of the house of Your servant regarding the distant future. And this is the [^h]custom of mankind, Lord God. 







###### 20 



Again what more can David say to You? For You know Your servant, Lord God! 







###### 21 



For the sake of Your word, and according to Your heart, You have done all this greatness, to let Your servant know. 







###### 22 



For this reason You are great, Lord God; for there is no one like You, and there is no God except You, according to all that we have heard with our ears. 







###### 23 



And what one nation on the earth is like Your people Israel, whom God went to redeem for Himself as a people, and to make a name for Himself, and to do a great thing for You and awesome things for Your land, [^i]because of Your people whom You have redeemed for Yourself from Egypt, _from other_ nations and their gods? 







###### 24 



For You have established for Yourself Your people Israel as Your _own_ people forever, and You, LORD, have become their God. 







###### 25 



Now then, LORD God, the word that You have spoken about Your servant and his house, confirm _it_ forever, and do just as You have spoken, 







###### 26 



so that Your name may be great forever, by saying, 'The LORD of armies _is_ God over Israel'; and may the house of Your servant David be established before You. 







###### 27 



For You, LORD of armies, God of Israel, have [^j]given a revelation to Your servant, saying, 'I will build you a house'; therefore Your servant has found [^k]courage to pray this prayer to You. 







###### 28 



Now then, Lord God, You are God, and Your words are truth; and You have [^l]promised this good thing to Your servant. 







###### 29 



And now, may [^m]it please You to bless the house of Your servant, so that it may continue forever before You. For You, Lord God, have spoken; and [^n]with Your blessing may the house of Your servant be blessed forever." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

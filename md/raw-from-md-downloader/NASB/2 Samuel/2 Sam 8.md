# 2 Samuel 8

***








###### 1 



Now it happened afterward that David [^a]defeated the Philistines and subdued them; and David took [^b]control of the chief city from the hand of the Philistines. 







###### 2 



And He [^c]defeated Moab, and measured them with the line, making them lie down on the ground; and he measured two lines to put to death, and a full line to keep alive. And the Moabites became servants to David, bringing tribute. 







###### 3 



Then David [^d]defeated Hadadezer, the son of Rehob king of Zobah, as he went to restore his [^e]power at the _Euphrates_ River. 







###### 4 



And David captured from him [^f]1,700 horsemen and twenty thousand foot soldiers; and David hamstrung _almost_ all the chariot horses, but left _enough_ of them _for_ a hundred chariots. 







###### 5 



When the Arameans of Damascus came to help Hadadezer, king of Zobah, David [^g]killed twenty-two thousand men among the Arameans. 







###### 6 



Then David put garrisons among the Arameans of Damascus, and the Arameans became servants to David, bringing tribute. And the LORD helped David wherever he went. 







###### 7 



David took the shields of gold which were [^h]carried by the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. 







###### 8 



And from [^i]Betah and Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, King David took a very large amount of bronze. 







###### 9 



Now when Toi king of Hamath heard that David had [^j]defeated the whole army of Hadadezer, 







###### 10 



Toi sent his son [^k]Joram to King David to [^l]greet him and bless him, because he had fought Hadadezer and [^m]defeated him; for Hadadezer [^n]had been at war with Toi. And [^o]_Joram_ brought with him articles of silver, gold, and bronze. 







###### 11 



King David also consecrated these _gifts_ to the LORD, with the silver and gold that he had consecrated from all the nations which he had subdued: 







###### 12 



from [^p]Aram, Moab, the sons of Ammon, the Philistines, Amalek, and from the spoils of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah. 







###### 13 



So David made a name _for himself_ when he returned from [^q]killing eighteen thousand [^r]Arameans in the Valley of Salt. 







###### 14 



He also put garrisons in Edom. In all Edom he put garrisons, and all the Edomites became servants to David. And the LORD helped David wherever he went. 







###### 15 



So David reigned over all Israel; and David [^s]administered justice and righteousness for all his people. 







###### 16 



Joab the son of Zeruiah _was commander_ over the army, and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud _was_ secretary. 







###### 17 



Zadok the son of Ahitub and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar _were_ priests, and Seraiah _was_ scribe. 







###### 18 



Benaiah the son of Jehoiada [^t]was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were [^u]chief ministers. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

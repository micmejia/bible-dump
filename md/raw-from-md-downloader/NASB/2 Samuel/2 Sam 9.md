# 2 Samuel 9

***








###### 1 



Then David said, "Is there [^a]anyone still left of the house of Saul, so that I could show him kindness for Jonathan's sake?" 







###### 2 



Now _there was_ a servant of the house of Saul whose name was Ziba, and they summoned him to David; and the king said to him, "Are you Ziba?" And he said, "_I am_ your servant." 







###### 3 



Then the king said, "Is there no one remaining of the house of Saul to whom I could show the kindness of God?" And Ziba said to the king, "There is still a son of Jonathan, one who is disabled in both feet." 







###### 4 



So the king said to him, "Where is he?" And Ziba said to the king, "Behold, he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, in Lo-debar." 







###### 5 



Then King David sent [^b]messengers who brought him from the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar. 







###### 6 



Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, came to David and fell on his face and prostrated himself. And David said, "Mephibosheth." And he said, "Here is your servant!" 







###### 7 



Then David said to him, "Do not be afraid, for I will assuredly show kindness to you for the sake of your father Jonathan, and I will restore to you all the [^c]land of your [^d]grandfather Saul; and you yourself shall [^e]eat at my table regularly." 







###### 8 



Again he prostrated himself, and said, "What is your servant, that you should be concerned about a dead dog like me?" 







###### 9 



Then the king summoned Saul's servant Ziba and said to him, "Everything that belonged to Saul and to all his house I have given to your master's [^f]grandson. 







###### 10 



You and your sons and your servants shall cultivate the land for him, and you shall bring in _the produce_ so that your master's grandson will have food [^g]to eat; nevertheless Mephibosheth, your master's grandson, shall [^h]eat at my table regularly." Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants. 







###### 11 



Then Ziba said to the king, "In accordance with everything that my lord the king commands his servant, so your servant will do." So Mephibosheth ate at [^i]David's table as one of the king's sons. 







###### 12 



Mephibosheth had a young son whose name was Mica. And all who lived in the house of Ziba were servants to Mephibosheth. 







###### 13 



So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem, because he ate at the king's table regularly. And he was disabled in his two feet. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

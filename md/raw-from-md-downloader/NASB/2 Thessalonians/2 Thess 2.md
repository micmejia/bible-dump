# 2 Thessalonians 2

***








###### 1 



Now we ask you, brothers _and sisters_, regarding the [^a]coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him, 







###### 2 



that you not be quickly shaken from your [^b]composure or be disturbed either by a spirit, or a [^c]message, or a letter as if from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has come. 







###### 3 



No one is to deceive you in any way! For _it will not come_ unless the [^d]apostasy comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction, 







###### 4 



who opposes and exalts himself above [^e]every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, displaying himself as being God. 







###### 5 



Do you not remember that while I was still with you, I was telling you these things? 







###### 6 



And you know what restrains _him_ now, so that he will be revealed in his time. 







###### 7 



For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only [^f]He who now restrains _will do so_ until [^g]He is [^h]removed. 







###### 8 



Then that lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will eliminate with the breath of His mouth and bring to an end by the appearance of His [^i]coming; 







###### 9 



_that is_, the one whose [^j]coming is in accord with the activity of Satan, with all power and false [^k]signs and wonders, 







###### 10 



and with [^l]all the deception of wickedness for those who perish, because they did not accept the love of the truth so as to be saved. 







###### 11 



For this reason God [^m]will send upon them [^n]a deluding influence so that they will believe [^o]what is false, 







###### 12 



in order that they all may be [^p]judged who did not believe the truth, but [^q]took pleasure in wickedness. ## Stand Firm 







###### 13 



But we should always give thanks to God for you, brothers _and sisters_ beloved by the Lord, because God has chosen you [^r]from the beginning for salvation [^s]through sanctification [^t]by the Spirit and faith in the truth. 







###### 14 



It was for this He called you through our gospel, [^u]that you may obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. 







###### 15 



So then, brothers _and sisters_, stand firm and hold on to the traditions which you were taught, whether by word _of mouth_ or by letter [^v]from us. 







###### 16 



Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself and God our Father, who has loved us and given us eternal comfort and good hope by grace, 







###### 17 



comfort and strengthen your hearts in every good work and word. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

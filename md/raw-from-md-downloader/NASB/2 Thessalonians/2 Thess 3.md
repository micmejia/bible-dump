# 2 Thessalonians 3

***








###### 1 



Finally, brothers _and sisters_, pray for us that the word of the Lord will [^a]spread rapidly and be glorified, just as _it was_ also with you; 







###### 2 



and that we will be rescued from troublesome and evil people; for not all have the faith. 







###### 3 



But the Lord is faithful, [^b]and He will strengthen and protect you [^c]from the evil one. 







###### 4 



We have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that you are doing, and will do, what we command. 







###### 5 



May the Lord direct your hearts to the love of God and to the perseverance of Christ. 







###### 6 



Now we command you, brothers _and sisters_, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you [^d]keep away from every brother _or sister_ who [^e]leads a [^f]disorderly life and not _one_ in accordance with the tradition which [^g]you received from us. 







###### 7 



For you yourselves know how you ought to [^h]follow our example, because we did not act in an undisciplined way among you, 







###### 8 



nor did we eat [^i]anyone's bread [^j]without paying for it, but with labor and hardship we _kept_ working night and day so that we would not be a burden to any of you; 







###### 9 



not because we do not have the right _to this_, but in order to offer ourselves as a role model for you, so that you would [^k]follow our example. 







###### 10 



For even when we were with you, we used to give you this order: if anyone is not willing to work, then he is not to eat, either. 







###### 11 



For we hear that some among you are leading an undisciplined life, doing no work at all, but acting like busybodies. 







###### 12 



Now we command and exhort such persons in the Lord Jesus Christ to work [^l]peacefully and eat their own bread. 







###### 13 



But as for you, brothers _and sisters_, do not grow weary of doing good. 







###### 14 



If anyone does not obey our [^m]instruction [^n]in this letter, take special note of that person _so as_ not to associate with him, so that he will be put to shame. 







###### 15 



And _yet_ do not regard _that person_ as an enemy, but [^o]admonish _that one_ as a brother _or sister_. 







###### 16 



Now may the Lord of peace Himself continually grant you peace in every [^p]circumstance. The Lord be with you all! 







###### 17 



[^q]I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand, and this is a distinguishing mark in every letter; this is the way I write. 







###### 18 



The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# 2 Timothy 1

***








###### 1 



Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus [^a]by the will of God, according to the promise of life in Christ Jesus, 







###### 2 



To Timothy, my beloved [^b]son: Grace, mercy, _and_ peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. 







###### 3 



I thank God, whom I serve with a clear conscience [^c]the way my forefathers did, as I constantly remember you in my [^d]prayers night and day, 







###### 4 



longing to see you, even as I recall your tears, so that I may be filled with joy. 







###### 5 



[^e]For I am mindful of the sincere faith within you, which first dwelled in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am sure that _it is_ in you as well. 







###### 6 



For this reason I remind you to kindle afresh the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands. 







###### 7 



For God has not given us a spirit of [^f]timidity, but of power and love and [^g]discipline. 







###### 8 



Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord or of me His prisoner, but join with _me_ in suffering for the gospel according to the power of God, 







###### 9 



who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace, which was granted to us in Christ Jesus from all eternity, 







###### 10 



but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel, 







###### 11 



for which I was appointed a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher. 







###### 12 



For this reason I also suffer these things; but I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and I am convinced that He is able to protect what I have entrusted to Him [^h]until that day. 







###### 13 



Hold on to the example of sound words which you have heard from me, in _the_ faith and love which are in Christ Jesus. 







###### 14 



Protect, through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us, the [^i]treasure which has been entrusted to _you_. 







###### 15 



You are aware of the fact that all who are in [^j]Asia turned away from me, among whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes. 







###### 16 



The Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my [^k]chains; 







###### 17 



but when he was in Rome, he eagerly searched for me and found me-- 







###### 18 



the Lord grant to him to find mercy from the Lord on that day--and you know very well what services he rendered at Ephesus. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

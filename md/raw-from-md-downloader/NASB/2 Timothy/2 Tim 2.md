# 2 Timothy 2

***








###### 1 



You therefore, my [^a]son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. 







###### 2 



The things which you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses, entrust these to faithful [^b]people who will be able to teach others also. 







###### 3 



Suffer hardship with _me_, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. 







###### 4 



No soldier in active service entangles himself in the affairs of everyday life, so that he may please the one who enlisted _him_. 







###### 5 



And if someone likewise competes as an athlete, he is not [^c]crowned _as victor_ unless he competes according to the rules. 







###### 6 



The hard-working farmer ought to be the first to receive his share of the crops. 







###### 7 



Consider what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything. 







###### 8 



Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, descendant of David, according to my gospel, 







###### 9 



[^d]for which I suffer hardship even to imprisonment as a criminal; but the word of God is not imprisoned. 







###### 10 



For this reason I endure all things for the sake of [^e]those who are chosen, so that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus _and_ with _it_ eternal glory. 







###### 11 



The statement is trustworthy: For if we died with Him, we will also live with Him; 







###### 12 



If we endure, we will also reign with Him; If we [^f]deny Him, He will also deny us; 







###### 13 



If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself. ## An Unashamed Worker 







###### 14 



Remind _them_ of these things, and solemnly exhort _them_ in the presence of God not to dispute about words, which is useless _and leads_ to the ruin of the listeners. 







###### 15 



Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a worker who [^g]does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth. 







###### 16 



But avoid worldly _and_ empty chatter, for [^h]it will lead to further ungodliness, 







###### 17 



and their [^i]talk will spread like [^j]gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, 







###### 18 



_men_ who have gone astray from the truth, claiming that the resurrection has already taken place; and they are jeopardizing the faith of some. 







###### 19 



Nevertheless, the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal: "The Lord knows those who are His;" and, "Everyone who names the name of the Lord is to keep away from wickedness." 







###### 20 



Now in a large house there are not only gold and silver implements, but also _implements_ of wood and of earthenware, and some _are_ for honor while others _are_ for dishonor. 







###### 21 



Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from these _things_, he will be an implement for honor, sanctified, useful to the Master, prepared for every good work. 







###### 22 



Now flee from youthful lusts and pursue righteousness, faith, love, _and_ peace with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart. 







###### 23 



But refuse foolish and ignorant speculations, knowing that they produce [^k]quarrels. 







###### 24 



The Lord's bond-servant must not be quarrelsome, but be kind to all, skillful in teaching, patient when wronged, 







###### 25 



with gentleness correcting those who are in opposition, if perhaps God may grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the truth, 







###### 26 



and they may come to their senses _and escape_ from the snare of the devil, having been held captive [^l]by him to do his will. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# 2 Timothy 3

***








###### 1 



But realize this, that in the last days difficult times will come. 







###### 2 



For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, slanderers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy, 







###### 3 



unloving, irreconcilable, malicious gossips, without self-control, brutal, [^a]haters of good, 







###### 4 



treacherous, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, 







###### 5 



holding to a form of [^b]godliness although they have denied its power; avoid _such people as_ these. 







###### 6 



For among them are those who [^c]slip into households and captivate [^d]weak women weighed down with sins, led on by various impulses, 







###### 7 



always learning and never able to come to the [^e]knowledge of the truth. 







###### 8 



Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men also oppose the truth, men of depraved mind, [^f]worthless in regard to the faith. 







###### 9 



But they will not make further progress; for their foolishness will be obvious to all, just as was that also of [^g]Jannes and Jambres. 







###### 10 



Now you followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, [^h]perseverance, 







###### 11 



persecutions, _and_ sufferings, such as happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, _and_ at Lystra; what persecutions I endured, and out of them all the Lord rescued me! 







###### 12 



Indeed, all who want to live in a godly way in Christ Jesus will be persecuted. 







###### 13 



But evil people and impostors will proceed _from bad_ to worse, deceiving and being deceived. 







###### 14 



You, however, continue in the things you have learned and become convinced of, knowing from whom you have learned _them_, 







###### 15 



and that from childhood you have known the sacred writings which are able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. 







###### 16 



All Scripture is [^i]inspired by God and beneficial for teaching, for [^j]rebuke, for correction, for training in righteousness; 







###### 17 



so that the man _or woman_ of God may be [^k]fully capable, equipped for every good work. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

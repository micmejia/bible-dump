# 2 Timothy 4

***








###### 1 



I solemnly exhort _you_ in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing and His kingdom: 







###### 2 



preach the word; be ready [^a]in season _and_ out of season; correct, rebuke, _and_ [^b]exhort, with [^c]great patience and instruction. 







###### 3 



For _the_ time will come when they will not tolerate sound doctrine; but _wanting_ to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance with their own desires, 







###### 4 



and they will turn their ears away from the truth and will turn aside to myths. 







###### 5 



But _as for_ you, use self-restraint in all things, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry. 







###### 6 



For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure has come. 







###### 7 



I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith; 







###### 8 



in the future there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day; and not only to me, but also to all who have loved His appearing. ## Personal Concerns 







###### 9 



Make every effort to come to me soon; 







###### 10 



for Demas, having loved this present [^d]world, has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica; Crescens _has gone_ to [^e]Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia. 







###### 11 



Only Luke is with me. Take along Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service. 







###### 12 



But I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus. 







###### 13 



When you come, bring the overcoat which I left at Troas with Carpus, and the books, especially the parchments. 







###### 14 



Alexander the coppersmith did me great harm; the Lord will repay him according to his deeds. 







###### 15 



Be on guard against him yourself too, for he vigorously opposed our [^f]teaching. 







###### 16 



At my first defense no one supported me, but all deserted me; may it not be counted against them. 







###### 17 



But the Lord stood with me and strengthened me, so that through me the proclamation might [^g]be fully accomplished, and that all the Gentiles might hear; and I was rescued out of the lion's mouth. 







###### 18 



The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed, and will [^h]bring me safely to His heavenly kingdom; to [^i]Him _be_ the glory forever and ever. Amen. 







###### 19 



Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus. 







###### 20 



Erastus remained at Corinth, but I left Trophimus sick at Miletus. 







###### 21 



Make every effort to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, also Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers _and sisters_. 







###### 22 



The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

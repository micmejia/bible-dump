# 3 John 1

***








###### 1 



The elder to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth. 







###### 2 



Beloved, I pray that in all respects you may prosper and be in good health, just as your soul prospers. 







###### 3 



For I was overjoyed when brothers came and testified to your truth, _that is_, how you are walking in truth. 







###### 4 



I have no greater joy than [^a]this, to hear of my children walking in the truth. 







###### 5 



Beloved, you are acting faithfully in whatever you accomplish for the brothers _and sisters_, and [^b]especially _when they are_ strangers; 







###### 6 



and they have testified to your love before the church. You will do well to [^c]send them on their way in a manner worthy of God. 







###### 7 



For they went out for the sake of the Name, accepting nothing from the Gentiles. 







###### 8 



Therefore we ought to [^d]support such people, so that we may [^e]prove to be fellow workers [^f]with the truth. 







###### 9 



I wrote something to the church; but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, does not accept [^g]what we say. 







###### 10 



For this reason, if I come, I will call attention to his deeds which he does, unjustly accusing us with malicious words; and not satisfied with this, he himself does not receive the brothers either, and he forbids those who want _to do so_ and puts _them_ out of the church. 







###### 11 



Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. The one who does what is good is of God; the one who does what is evil has not seen God. 







###### 12 



Demetrius has received a _good_ testimony from everyone, and from the truth itself; and we testify too, and you know that our testimony is true. 







###### 13 



I had many things to write to you, but I do not want to write to you with pen and ink; 







###### 14 



but I hope to see you shortly, and we will speak [^h]face to face. 







###### 15

# Acts 10

***








###### 1 



Now _there was_ a man in Caesarea named Cornelius, a centurion of what was called the Italian [^a]cohort, 







###### 2 



a devout man and one who feared God with all his household, and made many charitable contributions to the _Jewish_ people and prayed to God continually. 







###### 3 



About the [^b]ninth hour of the day he clearly saw in a vision an angel of God who had _just_ come in and said to him, "Cornelius!" 







###### 4 



And he looked at him intently and became terrified, and said, "What is it, lord?" And he said to him, "Your prayers and charitable gifts have ascended as a memorial offering before God. 







###### 5 



Now dispatch _some_ men to Joppa and send for a man _named_ Simon, who is also called Peter; 







###### 6 



he is staying with a tanner _named_ Simon, whose house is by the sea." 







###### 7 



When the angel who *spoke to him left, he summoned two of his [^c]servants and a devout soldier from his personal attendants, 







###### 8 



and after he had explained everything to them, he sent them to Joppa. 







###### 9 



On the next day, as they were on their way and approaching the city, Peter went up on the [^d]housetop about [^e]the sixth hour to pray. 







###### 10 



But he became hungry and wanted to eat; but while they were making preparations, he fell into a trance; 







###### 11 



and he *saw the sky opened up, and an [^f]object like a great sheet coming down, lowered by four corners to the ground, 







###### 12 



and on it were all _kinds of_ four-footed animals and [^g]crawling creatures of the earth and birds of the sky. 







###### 13 



A voice came to him, "Get up, Peter, [^h]kill and eat!" 







###### 14 



But Peter said, "By no means, Lord, for I have never eaten anything [^i]unholy and unclean." 







###### 15 



Again a voice _came_ to him a second time, "What God has cleansed, no _longer_ [^j]consider unholy." 







###### 16 



This happened three times, and immediately the [^k]object was taken up into the sky. 







###### 17 



Now while Peter was greatly perplexed in [^l]mind as to what the vision which he had seen might [^m]mean, behold, the men who had been sent by Cornelius had asked directions to Simon's house, and they appeared at the gate; 







###### 18 



and calling out, they were asking whether Simon, who was also called Peter, was staying there. 







###### 19 



While Peter was reflecting on the vision, the Spirit said to him, "Behold, [^n]three men are looking for you. 







###### 20 



But get up, go downstairs and accompany them [^o]without misgivings, for I have sent them Myself." 







###### 21 



Peter went down to the men and said, "Behold, I am the one you are looking for; what is the reason for which you have come?" 







###### 22 



They said, "Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous and God-fearing man well spoken of by the entire nation of the Jews, was _divinely_ directed by a holy angel to send for you _to come_ to his house and hear [^p]a message from you." 







###### 23 



So he invited them in and gave them lodging. ## Peter in Caesarea Now on the next day he got ready and went away with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him. 







###### 24 



On the following day he entered Caesarea. Now Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends. 







###### 25 



When Peter entered, Cornelius met him, and fell at his feet and [^q]worshiped _him_. 







###### 26 



But Peter helped him up, saying, "Stand up; I, too, am just a man." 







###### 27 



As he talked with him, he entered and *found many people assembled. 







###### 28 



And he said to them, "You yourselves know that it is forbidden for a Jewish man to associate with or visit a [^r]foreigner; and _yet_ God has shown me that I am not to call any person [^s]unholy or unclean. 







###### 29 



That is why I came without even raising any objection when I was sent for. So I ask, for what reason did you send for me?" 







###### 30 



Cornelius said, "Four days ago to this hour, I was praying in my house during the [^t]ninth hour; and behold, a man stood before me in shining clothing, 







###### 31 



and he *said, 'Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your charitable gifts have been remembered before God. 







###### 32 



Therefore send _some men_ to Joppa and invite Simon, who is also called Peter, to come to you; he is staying at the house of Simon _the_ tanner, by the sea.' 







###### 33 



So I sent _men_ to you immediately, and you have [^u]been kind enough to come. Now then, we are all here present before God to hear everything that you have been commanded by the Lord." ## Gentiles Hear Good News 







###### 34 



Opening his mouth, Peter said: "I most certainly understand _now_ that God is not one to show partiality, 







###### 35 



but in every nation the one who [^v]fears Him and [^w]does what is right is acceptable to Him. 







###### 36 



The word which He sent to the sons of Israel, preaching [^x]peace through Jesus Christ (He is Lord of all)-- 







###### 37 



you yourselves know the thing that happened throughout Judea, starting from Galilee, after the baptism which John proclaimed. 







###### 38 



[^y]_You know of_ Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed Him with the Holy Spirit and with power, [^z]and _how_ He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him. 







###### 39 



We are witnesses of all the things that He did both in the [^aa]country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They also put Him to death by hanging Him on [^ab]a cross. 







###### 40 



God raised Him up on the third day and granted that He [^ac]be revealed, 







###### 41 



not to all the people, but to witnesses who had been chosen beforehand by God, _that is_, to us who ate and drank with Him after He arose from the dead. 







###### 42 



And He ordered us to [^ad]preach to the people, and to testify solemnly that this is the One who has been appointed by God as Judge of the living and the dead. 







###### 43 



All the prophets testify of Him, that through His name everyone who believes in Him receives forgiveness of sins." 







###### 44 



While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who were listening to the [^ae]message. 







###### 45 



All the [^af]Jewish believers who came with Peter were amazed, because the gift of the Holy Spirit had also been poured out on the Gentiles. 







###### 46 



For they were hearing them speaking with tongues and exalting God. Then Peter responded, 







###### 47 



"Surely no one can refuse the water for these to be baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit just as we _did_, can he?" 







###### 48 



And he ordered them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay on for a few days. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

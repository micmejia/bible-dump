# Acts 11

***








###### 1 



Now the apostles and the brothers _and sisters_ who were throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God. 







###### 2 



And when Peter came up to Jerusalem, [^a]the Jewish _believers_ took issue with him, 







###### 3 



saying, "You [^b]went to [^c]uncircumcised men and ate with them." 







###### 4 



But Peter began and explained _at length_ to them in an orderly sequence, saying, 







###### 5 



"I was in the city of Joppa praying; and in a trance I saw a vision, an [^d]object coming down like a great sheet lowered by four corners from the sky; and it came to where I _was_, 







###### 6 



and I stared at it and was thinking about it, and I saw the four-footed animals of the earth, the wild animals, the [^e]crawling creatures, and the birds of the sky. 







###### 7 



I also heard a voice saying to me, 'Get up, Peter; [^f]kill and eat.' 







###### 8 



But I said, 'By no means, Lord, for nothing [^g]unholy or unclean has ever entered my mouth.' 







###### 9 



But a voice from heaven answered a second time, 'What God has cleansed, no longer [^h]consider unholy.' 







###### 10 



This happened three times, and everything was drawn back up into the sky. 







###### 11 



And behold, at that moment three men who had been sent to me from Caesarea came up to the house where we were _staying_. 







###### 12 



And the Spirit told me to go with them without [^i]misgivings. These six brothers also went with me, and we entered the man's house. 







###### 13 



And he reported to us how he had seen the angel [^j]standing in his house, and saying, 'Send _some men_ to Joppa and have Simon, who is also called Peter, brought here; 







###### 14 



and he will speak words to you by which you will be saved, you and all your household.' 







###### 15 



And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them just as _He did_ upon us at the beginning. 







###### 16 



And I remembered the word of the Lord, how He used to say, 'John baptized with water, but you will be baptized [^k]with the Holy Spirit.' 







###### 17 



Therefore, if God gave them the same gift as _He_ also _gave_ to us after believing in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could [^l]stand in God's way?" 







###### 18 



When they heard this, they [^m]quieted down and glorified God, saying, "Well then, God has also granted to the Gentiles the repentance _that leads_ to life." ## The Church in Antioch 







###### 19 



So then those who were scattered because of the [^n]persecution that occurred in connection with Stephen made their way [^o]to Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except to Jews alone. 







###### 20 



But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who came to Antioch and _began_ speaking to the [^p]Greeks as well, preaching the good news of the Lord Jesus. 







###### 21 



And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a large number who believed turned to the Lord. 







###### 22 



The [^q]news about them [^r]reached the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas off [^s]to Antioch. 







###### 23 



Then when he arrived and [^t]witnessed the grace of God, he rejoiced and _began_ to encourage them all with [^u]resolute heart to remain _true_ to the Lord; 







###### 24 



for he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and faith. And [^v]considerable numbers were added to the Lord. 







###### 25 



And he left for Tarsus to look for Saul; 







###### 26 



and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. And for an entire year they [^w]met with the church and taught [^x]considerable numbers of people; and the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch. 







###### 27 



Now [^y]at this time _some_ prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. 







###### 28 



One of them, named Agabus, stood up and [^z]indicated [^aa]by the Spirit that there would definitely be a severe famine all over the [^ab]world. [^ac]And this took place in the _reign_ of Claudius. 







###### 29 



And to the extent that any of the disciples had means, each of them determined to send _a contribution_ for the [^ad]relief of the brothers _and sisters_ living in Judea. 







###### 30 



And they did this, sending it [^ae]with Barnabas and Saul to the elders. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

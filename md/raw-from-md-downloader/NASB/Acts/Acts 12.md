# Acts 12

***








###### 1 



Now about that time [^a]Herod the king laid hands on some who belonged to the church, to do them harm. 







###### 2 



And he had James the brother of John executed with a sword. 







###### 3 



When he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter as well. (Now _these_ were [^b]the days of Unleavened Bread.) 







###### 4 



When he had arrested him, he put him in prison, turning him over to four [^c]squads of soldiers to guard him, intending _only_ after the Passover to bring him before the people. 







###### 5 



So Peter was kept in the prison, but prayer for him was being made to God [^d]intensely by the church. 







###### 6 



On [^e]the very night when Herod was about to bring him forward, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and guards in front of the door were watching over the prison. 







###### 7 



And behold, an angel of the Lord suddenly stood near _Peter_, and a light shone in the cell; and he struck Peter's side and woke him, saying, "Get up quickly." And his chains fell off his hands. 







###### 8 



And the angel said to him, "Put on your belt and [^f]strap on your sandals." And he did so. And he *said to him, "Wrap your cloak around you and follow me." 







###### 9 



And he went out and continued to follow, and _yet_ he did not know that what was being done by the angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision. 







###### 10 



Now when they had passed the first and second guard, they came to the iron gate that leads into the city, which opened for them by itself; and they went out and went along one street, and immediately the angel departed from him. 







###### 11 



When Peter came [^g]to himself, he said, "Now I know for sure that the Lord has sent forth His angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all [^h]that the Jewish people were expecting." 







###### 12 



And when he realized _this_, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John, who was also called Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying. 







###### 13 



When he knocked at the door of the gate, a slave woman named Rhoda came to answer. 







###### 14 



When she recognized Peter's voice, because of her joy she did not open the gate, but ran in and announced that Peter was standing in front of the gate. 







###### 15 



They said to her, "You are out of your mind!" But she kept insisting that it was so. They said, "It is his angel." 







###### 16 



But Peter continued knocking; and when they had opened _the door_, they saw him and were amazed. 







###### 17 



But motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he described to them how the Lord had led him out of the prison. And he said, "Report these things to [^i]James and the brothers." Then he left and went to another place. 







###### 18 



Now when day came, there was no small disturbance among the soldiers _as to_ [^j]what could have become of Peter. 







###### 19 



When Herod had searched for him and had not found him, he examined the guards and ordered that they be led away _to execution_. Then he went down from Judea to Caesarea and was spending time there. ## Death of Herod 







###### 20 



Now he was very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon; and with one mind they came to him, and having won over Blastus the king's chamberlain, they were asking for peace, because their country was supported _with grain_ from the king's country. 







###### 21 



On an appointed day, after putting on his royal apparel, Herod took his seat on the [^k]rostrum and _began_ delivering an address to them. 







###### 22 



The people _repeatedly_ cried out, "The voice of a god and not of a man!" 







###### 23 



And immediately an angel of the Lord struck him because he did not give God the glory, and he was eaten by worms and [^l]died. 







###### 24 



But the word of the Lord continued to grow and to be multiplied. 







###### 25 



And Barnabas and Saul returned when they had fulfilled their [^m]mission to Jerusalem, taking along with _them_ John, who was also called Mark. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

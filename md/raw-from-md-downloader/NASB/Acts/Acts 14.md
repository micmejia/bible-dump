# Acts 14

***








###### 1 



In Iconium they entered the synagogue of the Jews together, and spoke in such a way that a large number of people believed, both of Jews and of Greeks. 







###### 2 



But the [^a]unbelieving Jews stirred up the [^b]minds of the Gentiles and embittered them against the brothers. 







###### 3 



Therefore they spent a long time _there_ speaking boldly _with reliance_ upon the Lord, who was testifying to the word of His grace, granting that [^c]signs and wonders be performed by their hands. 







###### 4 



But the [^d]people of the city were divided; and some [^e]sided with the Jews, while others, with the apostles. 







###### 5 



And when an attempt was made by both the Gentiles and the Jews with their rulers, to treat them abusively and to stone them, 







###### 6 



they became aware of it and fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the surrounding region; 







###### 7 



and there they continued to preach the gospel. 







###### 8 



In Lystra a man was sitting whose feet were incapacitated. _He had been_ disabled from his mother's womb, and had never walked. 







###### 9 



This man was listening to Paul as he spoke. _Paul_ looked at him intently and saw that he had faith to be [^f]made well, 







###### 10 



and he said with a loud voice, "Stand upright on your feet!" And _the man_ leaped up and _began_ to walk. 







###### 11 



When the crowds saw what Paul had done, they raised their voice, saying in the Lycaonian language, "The gods have become like men and have come down to us!" 







###### 12 



And they _began_ calling Barnabas, [^g]Zeus, and Paul, [^h]Hermes, since he was [^i]the chief speaker. 







###### 13 



Moreover, the priest of Zeus, whose _temple_ was [^j]just outside the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and wanted to offer sacrifice with the crowds. 







###### 14 



But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard _about it_, they tore their [^k]robes and rushed out into the crowd, crying out 







###### 15 



and saying, "Men, why are you doing these things? We are also men, of the same nature as you, preaching the gospel to you, to turn from these [^l]useless things to a living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and everything that is in them. 







###### 16 



[^m]In past generations He permitted all the [^n]nations to go their own ways; 







###### 17 



yet He did not leave Himself without witness, in that He did good and gave you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, [^o]satisfying your hearts with food and gladness." 







###### 18 



And _even by_ saying these things, _only with_ difficulty did they restrain the crowds from offering sacrifices to them. 







###### 19 



But Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and having won over the crowds, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, thinking that he was dead. 







###### 20 



But while the disciples stood around him, he got up and entered the city. The next day he left with Barnabas for Derbe. 







###### 21 



And after they had preached the gospel to that city and had made a good number of disciples, they returned to Lystra, to Iconium, and to Antioch, 







###### 22 



strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the faith, and _saying_, "_It is_ through many tribulations _that_ we must enter the kingdom of God." 







###### 23 



When they had appointed elders for them in every church, having prayed with fasting, they entrusted them to the Lord in whom they had believed. 







###### 24 



They passed through Pisidia and came into Pamphylia. 







###### 25 



When they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia. 







###### 26 



From there they sailed to Antioch, where they had been entrusted to the grace of God for the work that they had [^p]accomplished. 







###### 27 



When they had arrived and gathered the church together, they _began_ to report all the things that God had done with them and [^q]how He had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles. 







###### 28 



And they spent [^r]a long time with the disciples. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

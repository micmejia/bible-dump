# Acts 18

***








###### 1 



After these _events Paul_ left Athens and went to Corinth. 







###### 2 



And he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus having recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to leave Rome. He came to them, 







###### 3 



and because he was of the same trade he stayed with them, and they worked _together_, for they were tent-makers by trade. 







###### 4 



And _Paul_ was reasoning in the synagogue every Sabbath and trying to persuade Jews and Greeks. 







###### 5 



But when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul _began_ devoting himself completely to the word, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the [^a]Christ. 







###### 6 



But when they resisted and blasphemed, he shook out his garments and said to them, "Your blood _is_ [^b]on your own heads! I am clean. From now on I will go to the Gentiles." 







###### 7 



Then he left [^c]the synagogue and went to the house of a man named [^d]Titius Justus, a worshiper of God, whose house was next door to the synagogue. 







###### 8 



Crispus, the leader of the synagogue, believed in the Lord together with his entire household; and many of the Corinthians, as they listened _to Paul_, were believing and being baptized. 







###### 9 



And the Lord said to Paul by a vision at night, "Do not be afraid _any longer_, but go on speaking and do not be silent; 







###### 10 



for I am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you, for I have many people in this city." 







###### 11 



And he settled _there_ for a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them. 







###### 12 



But while Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews rose up together against Paul and brought him before the [^e]judgment seat, 







###### 13 



saying, "This man is inciting the people to worship God contrary to the [^f]law." 







###### 14 



But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, "If it were _a matter of_ some crime or vicious, unscrupulous act, O Jews, it would be reasonable for me to put up with you; 







###### 15 



but if there are [^g]questions about [^h]teaching and [^i]persons and your own law, see to it yourselves; I am unwilling to be a judge of these matters." 







###### 16 



And he drove them away from the [^j]judgment seat. 







###### 17 



But they all took hold of Sosthenes, the leader of the synagogue, and _began_ beating him in front of the judgment seat. And _yet_ Gallio was not concerned about any of these things. 







###### 18 



Now Paul, when he had remained many days longer, took leave of the brothers _and sisters_ and sailed away to Syria, and Priscilla and Aquila were with him. [^k]Paul _first_ had his hair cut at Cenchrea, for he was keeping a vow. 







###### 19 



They came to Ephesus, and he left them there. Now he himself entered the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews. 







###### 20 



When they asked him to stay for a longer time, he did not consent, 







###### 21 



but took leave of them and said, "I will return to you again if God wills," and he set sail from Ephesus. 







###### 22 



When he had landed in Caesarea, he went up _to Jerusalem_ and greeted the church, and went down to Antioch. ## Third Missionary Journey 







###### 23 



And after spending some time _there_, he left and passed successively through the Galatian region and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples. 







###### 24 



Now a Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, [^l]an eloquent man, came to Ephesus; and he was proficient in the Scriptures. 







###### 25 



This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he was accurately speaking and teaching things about Jesus, being acquainted only with the baptism of John; 







###### 26 



and [^m]he began speaking boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and explained the way of God more accurately to him. 







###### 27 



And when he wanted to go across to Achaia, the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him; and when he had arrived, he greatly [^n]helped those who had believed through grace, 







###### 28 



for he powerfully refuted the Jews in public, demonstrating by the Scriptures that Jesus was the [^o]Christ. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

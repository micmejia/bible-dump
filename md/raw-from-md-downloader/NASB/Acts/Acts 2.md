# Acts 2

***








###### 1 



When the day of Pentecost [^a]had come, they were all together in one place. 







###### 2 



And suddenly a noise like a violent rushing wind came from heaven, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. 







###### 3 



And tongues _that looked_ like fire appeared to them, [^b]distributing themselves, and _a tongue_ [^c]rested on each one of them. 







###### 4 



And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with different [^d]tongues, as the Spirit was giving them _the ability_ to speak out. 







###### 5 



Now there were Jews residing in Jerusalem, devout men from every nation under heaven. 







###### 6 



And when this sound occurred, the crowd came together and they were bewildered, because each one of them was hearing them speak in his own [^e]language. 







###### 7 



They were amazed and astonished, saying, "[^f]Why, are not all these who are speaking Galileans? 







###### 8 



And how _is it that_ we each hear _them_ in our own [^g]language [^h]to which we were born? 







###### 9 



Parthians, Medes, and Elamites, and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea, and Cappadocia, Pontus and [^i]Asia, 







###### 10 



Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya around Cyrene, and [^j]visitors from Rome, both Jews and [^k]proselytes, 







###### 11 



Cretans and Arabs--we hear them speaking in our _own_ [^l]tongues of the mighty deeds of God." 







###### 12 



And they all continued in amazement and great perplexity, saying to one another, "What does this mean?" 







###### 13 



But others were jeering and saying, "They are full of [^m]sweet wine!" ## Peter's Sermon 







###### 14 



But Peter, taking his stand with the _other_ eleven, raised his voice and declared to them: "Men of Judea and all you who live in Jerusalem, [^n]know this, and pay attention to my words. 







###### 15 



For these people are not drunk, as you assume, since it is _only_ the [^o]third hour of the day; 







###### 16 



but this is what has been spoken through the prophet Joel: 







###### 17 



'And it shall be in the last days,' God says, 'That I will pour out My Spirit on all [^p]mankind; And your sons and your daughters will prophesy, And your young men will see visions, And your old men will [^q]have dreams; 







###### 18 



And even on My male and female [^r]servants I will pour out My Spirit in those days, And they will prophesy. 







###### 19 



And I will [^s]display wonders in the sky above And signs on the earth below, Blood, fire, and [^t]vapor of smoke. 







###### 20 



The sun will be turned into darkness And the moon into blood, Before the great and glorious day of the Lord comes. 







###### 21 



And it shall be _that_ everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.' 







###### 22 



"Men of Israel, listen to these words: Jesus the Nazarene, a Man [^u]attested to you by God with [^v]miracles and wonders and [^w]signs which God performed through Him in your midst, just as you yourselves know-- 







###### 23 



this _Man_, delivered over by the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God, you nailed to a cross by the hands of [^x]godless men and put _Him_ to death. 







###### 24 



[^y]But God raised Him _from the dead_, putting an end to the [^z]agony of death, since it was impossible for Him to be held [^aa]in its power. 







###### 25 



For David says of Him, 'I saw the Lord continually before me, Because He is at my right hand, so that I will not be shaken. 







###### 26 



Therefore my heart was glad and my tongue was overjoyed; Moreover my flesh also will live in hope; 







###### 27 



For You will not abandon my soul to Hades, Nor will You [^ab]allow Your [^ac]Holy One to [^ad]undergo decay. 







###### 28 



You have made known to me the ways of life; You will make me full of gladness with Your presence.' 







###### 29 



"[^ae]Brothers, I may confidently say to you regarding the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is [^af]with us to this day. 







###### 30 



So because he was a prophet and knew that God had sworn to him with an oath to seat _one_ [^ag]of his descendants on his throne, 







###### 31 



he looked ahead and spoke of the resurrection of the [^ah]Christ, that He was neither abandoned to Hades, nor did His flesh [^ai]suffer decay. 







###### 32 



_It is_ this Jesus _whom_ God raised up, [^aj]_a fact_ to which we are all witnesses. 







###### 33 



Therefore, [^ak]since He has been exalted [^al]at the right hand of God, and has received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, He has poured out this which you both see and hear. 







###### 34 



For it was not David who ascended into [^am]heaven, but he himself says: 'The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at My right hand, 







###### 35 



Until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet."' 







###### 36 



Therefore let all the house of Israel know for certain that God has made Him both Lord and [^an]Christ--this Jesus whom you crucified." 







###### 37 



Now when they heard _this_, they were [^ao]pierced to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, "[^ap]Brothers, what are we to do?" 







###### 38 



Peter _said_ to them, "Repent, and each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. 







###### 39 



For the promise is for you and your children and for all who are far away, as many as the Lord our God will call to Himself." 







###### 40 



And with many other words he solemnly testified and kept on urging them, saying, "[^aq]Be saved from this perverse generation!" 







###### 41 



So then, those who had received his word were baptized; and that day there were added about three thousand [^ar]souls. 







###### 42 



They were continually devoting themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to [^as]prayer. 







###### 43 



[^at]Everyone kept feeling a sense of awe; and many wonders and [^au]signs were taking place through the apostles. 







###### 44 



And all the believers [^av]were together and had all things in common; 







###### 45 



and they would sell their property and possessions and share them with all, to the extent that anyone had need. 







###### 46 



Day by day continuing with one mind in the temple, and breaking bread [^aw]from house to house, they were taking their [^ax]meals together with gladness and [^ay]sincerity of heart, 







###### 47 



praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord was adding to [^az]their number day by day those who were being saved. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

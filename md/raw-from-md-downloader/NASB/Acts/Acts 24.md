# Acts 24

***








###### 1 



Now after five days the high priest Ananias came down with some elders and an attorney _named_ Tertullus, and they [^a]brought charges against Paul to the governor. 







###### 2 



After [^b]Paul had been summoned, Tertullus began accusing him, saying _to the governor_, "Since we have attained great peace through you, and since reforms are being carried out for this nation by your foresight, 







###### 3 



we acknowledge _this_ in every way and everywhere, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness. 







###### 4 



But, that I may not [^c]weary you further, I beg you [^d]to grant us a brief hearing, by your kindness. 







###### 5 



For we have found this man a public menace and one who stirs up dissensions among all the Jews throughout [^e]the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes. 







###### 6 



And he even tried to desecrate the temple, so indeed we arrested him.[^f] 







###### 8 



By interrogating him yourself concerning all these matters, you will be able to ascertain the things of which we are accusing him." 







###### 9 



The Jews also joined in the attack, asserting that these things were so. 







###### 10 



And when the governor had nodded for him to speak, Paul responded: "Knowing that for many years you have been a judge to this nation, I cheerfully make my defense, 







###### 11 



since you can take note of the fact that no more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship. 







###### 12 



And neither in the temple did they find me carrying on a discussion with anyone or causing [^g]a riot, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city _itself_. 







###### 13 



Nor can they prove to you _the things_ of which they now accuse me. 







###### 14 



But I confess this to you, that in accordance with [^h]the Way, which they call a sect, I do serve the God of our fathers, believing everything that is in accordance with the Law and is written in the Prophets; 







###### 15 



having a hope in God, which these men cherish themselves, that there shall certainly be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked. 







###### 16 



In view of this I also do my best to maintain a blameless conscience _both_ before God and before _other_ people, always. 







###### 17 



Now after several years I came to bring charitable gifts to my nation and to present offerings, 







###### 18 



in which they found me _occupied_ in the temple, having been purified, without _any_ crowd or uproar. But _there were_ some Jews from [^i]Asia-- 







###### 19 



who ought to have been present before you and to have been bringing charges, if they should have anything against me. 







###### 20 



Or _else_ have these men themselves declare what violation they discovered when I stood before the [^j]Council, 







###### 21 



other than in regard to this one declaration which I shouted while standing among them, 'For the resurrection of the dead I am on trial before you today!'" 







###### 22 



But Felix, [^k]having quite accurate knowledge about [^l]the Way, adjourned them, saying, "When Lysias the commander comes down, I will decide your case." 







###### 23 



He gave orders to the centurion for [^m]Paul to be kept in custody and _yet_ have _some_ freedom, and not to prevent any of his friends from providing for his needs. 







###### 24 



Now some days later Felix arrived with Drusilla his [^n]wife, who was Jewish, and he sent for Paul and heard him _speak_ about faith in Christ Jesus. 







###### 25 



But as he was discussing righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix became frightened and responded, "Go away for now, and when I have an opportunity, I will summon you." 







###### 26 



At the same time he was also hoping that money would be given to him by Paul; therefore he also used to send for him quite often and talk with him. 







###### 27 



But after two years had passed, Felix [^o]was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and Felix, wanting to do the Jews a favor, left Paul imprisoned. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

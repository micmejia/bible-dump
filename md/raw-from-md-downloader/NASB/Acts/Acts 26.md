# Acts 26

***








###### 1 



Now Agrippa said to Paul, "You are permitted to speak for yourself." Then Paul extended his hand and _proceeded_ to make his defense: 







###### 2 



"Regarding all the things of which I am accused by the Jews, King Agrippa, I consider myself fortunate that I am about to make my defense before you today, 







###### 3 



[^a]especially because you are an expert in all customs and [^b]questions among _the_ Jews; therefore I beg you to listen to me patiently. 







###### 4 



"So then, all Jews know my way of life since _my_ youth, which from the beginning was spent among my _own_ nation and in Jerusalem, 







###### 5 



since they have known about me for a long time, if they are willing to testify, that I lived _as_ a Pharisee according to the strictest sect of our religion. 







###### 6 



And now I am standing trial for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers; 







###### 7 



_the promise_ to which our twelve tribes hope to attain, as they earnestly serve _God_ night and day. For this hope, O king, I am being accused by Jews. 







###### 8 



Why is it considered incredible among you _people_ if God raises the dead? 







###### 9 



"So I thought to myself that I had to act in strong opposition to the name of Jesus [^c]of Nazareth. 







###### 10 



And this is [^d]just what I did in Jerusalem; not only did I lock up many of the [^e]saints in prisons, after receiving authority from the chief priests, but I also cast my vote against them when they were being put to death. 







###### 11 



And as I punished them often in all the synagogues, I tried to force them to blaspheme; and since I was extremely enraged at them, I kept pursuing them even to [^f]foreign cities. 







###### 12 



"[^g]While so engaged, as I was journeying to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests, 







###### 13 



at midday, O king, I saw on the way a light from heaven, [^h]brighter than the sun, shining around me and those who were journeying with me. 







###### 14 



And when we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in the [^i]Hebrew dialect, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me? [^j]It is hard for you to kick against the goads.' 







###### 15 



And I said, 'Who are You, Lord?' And the Lord said, 'I am Jesus whom you are persecuting. 







###### 16 



But get up and stand on your feet; for this _purpose_ I have appeared to you, to appoint you as a servant and a witness not only to the things in which you have seen Me, but also to the things in which I will appear to you, 







###### 17 



rescuing you from the _Jewish_ people and from the Gentiles, to whom I am sending you, 







###### 18 



to open their eyes so that they may turn from darkness to light, and from the [^k]power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified by faith in Me.' 







###### 19 



"For that reason, King Agrippa, I did not prove disobedient to the heavenly vision, 







###### 20 



but _continually_ proclaimed to those in Damascus first, and in Jerusalem, and _then_ all the region of Judea, and _even_ to the Gentiles, that they are to repent and turn to God, performing deeds consistent with repentance. 







###### 21 



For these reasons _some_ Jews seized me in the temple and tried to murder me. 







###### 22 



So, having obtained help from God, I stand to this day testifying both to small and great, stating nothing but what the Prophets and Moses said was going to take place, 







###### 23 



_as to_ whether the [^l]Christ was [^m]to suffer, _and_ whether, as first from the resurrection of the dead, He would proclaim light both to the _Jewish_ people and to the Gentiles." 







###### 24 



While [^n]Paul was stating these things in his defense, Festus *said in a loud voice, "Paul, you are out of your mind! [^o]_Your_ great learning is [^p]driving you insane." 







###### 25 



But Paul *said, "I am not insane, most excellent Festus; on the contrary, I am speaking out _with_ [^q]truthful and rational words. 







###### 26 



For the king [^r]knows about these matters, and I also speak to him with confidence, since I am persuaded that none of these things escape his notice; for this has not been done in a [^s]corner. 







###### 27 



King Agrippa, do you believe the Prophets? I know that you believe." 







###### 28 



Agrippa _replied_ to Paul, "[^t]In a short _time_ you _are going to_ persuade me to [^u]make a Christian _of myself_." 







###### 29 



And Paul _said_, "I would [^v]wish to God that even [^w]in a short or long _time_ not only you, but also all who hear me this day would become such as I myself am, except for these chains." 







###### 30 



The king stood up and the governor and Bernice, and those who were sitting with them, 







###### 31 



and when they had gone out, they _began_ talking to one another, saying, "This man is not doing anything deserving death or [^x]imprisonment." 







###### 32 



And Agrippa said to Festus, "This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

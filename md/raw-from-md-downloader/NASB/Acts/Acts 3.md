# Acts 3

***








###### 1 



Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the [^a]ninth _hour_, the hour of prayer. 







###### 2 



And a man who had been unable to walk from [^b]birth was being carried, whom they used to set down every day at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, in order _for him_ to beg for charitable gifts from those entering the temple _grounds_. 







###### 3 



When he saw Peter and John about to go into the temple _grounds_, he _began_ asking to receive a charitable gift. 







###### 4 



But Peter, along with John, looked at him intently and said, "Look at us!" 







###### 5 



And he gave them his attention, expecting to receive something from them. 







###### 6 



But Peter said, "I do not have silver and gold, but what I do have I give to you: In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, walk!" 







###### 7 



And grasping him by the right hand, he raised him up; and immediately his feet and his ankles were strengthened. 







###### 8 



And leaping up, he stood and _began_ to walk; and he entered the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God. 







###### 9 



And all the people saw him walking and praising God; 







###### 10 



and they recognized him as being the very one who used to sit at the Beautiful Gate of the temple _to beg_ for charitable gifts, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him. ## Peter's Second Sermon 







###### 11 



While he was clinging to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them at the [^c]portico named Solomon's, completely astonished. 







###### 12 



But when Peter saw _this_, he replied to the people, "Men of Israel, why are you amazed at this, or why are you staring at us, as though by our own power or godliness we had made him walk? 







###### 13 



The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified His [^d]servant Jesus, _the one_ whom you handed over and disowned in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to release _Him_. 







###### 14 



But you disowned the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you, 







###### 15 



but put to death the [^e]Prince of life, whom God raised from the dead, [^f]_a fact_ to which we are witnesses. 







###### 16 



And on the basis of faith in His name, _it is_ [^g]the name of Jesus which has strengthened this man whom you see and know; and the faith which _comes_ through Him has given him this perfect health in the presence of you all. 







###### 17 



"And now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, just as your rulers also did. 







###### 18 



But the things which God previously announced by the mouths of all the prophets, that His [^h]Christ would suffer, He has fulfilled in this way. 







###### 19 



Therefore repent and return, so that your sins may be wiped away, in order that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord; 







###### 20 



and that He may send Jesus, the [^i]Christ appointed for you, 







###### 21 



whom heaven must receive until _the_ [^j]period of restoration of all things, about which God spoke by the mouths of His holy prophets from ancient times. 







###### 22 



Moses said, 'The Lord God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your countrymen; to Him you shall listen regarding everything He says to you. 







###### 23 



And it shall be that every soul that does not listen to that prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.' 







###### 24 



And likewise, all the prophets who have spoken from Samuel and _his_ successors _onward_, have also announced these days. 







###### 25 



It is you who are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant which God ordained with your fathers, saying to Abraham, 'And in your seed all the families of the earth shall be blessed.' 







###### 26 



God raised up His [^k]Servant for you first, and sent Him to bless you by turning every one _of you_ from your wicked ways." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

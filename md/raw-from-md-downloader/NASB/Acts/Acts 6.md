# Acts 6

***








###### 1 



Now [^a]at this time, as the disciples were increasing _in number_, a complaint developed _on the part of_ the [^b]Hellenistic _Jews_ against the _native_ Hebrews, because their widows were being overlooked in the daily serving _of food_. 







###### 2 



So the twelve summoned the [^c]congregation of the disciples and said, "It is not desirable for us to neglect the word of God in order to serve tables. 







###### 3 



Instead, brothers _and sisters_, select from among you seven men of good reputation, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may put in charge of this task. 







###### 4 



But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the [^d]ministry of the word." 







###### 5 



The [^e]announcement found approval with the whole [^f]congregation; and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and [^g]Nicolas, a [^h]proselyte from Antioch. 







###### 6 



And they brought these men before the apostles; and after praying, they laid their hands on them. 







###### 7 



The word of God kept spreading; and the number of the disciples continued to increase greatly in Jerusalem, and a great many of the priests were becoming obedient to the faith. 







###### 8 



And Stephen, full of grace and power, was performing great wonders and [^i]signs among the people. 







###### 9 



But some men from what was called the Synagogue of the Freedmen, _including_ both Cyrenians and Alexandrians, and some from Cilicia and [^j]Asia, rose up and argued with Stephen. 







###### 10 



But they were unable to [^k]cope with his wisdom and the Spirit by whom he was speaking. 







###### 11 



Then they secretly induced men to say, "We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God." 







###### 12 



And they stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes, and they came up to him and dragged him away, and brought him [^l]before the [^m]Council. 







###### 13 



They put forward false witnesses who said, "This man does not stop [^n]speaking against this holy place and the Law; 







###### 14 



for we have heard him say that this Nazarene, Jesus, will destroy this place and change the customs which Moses handed down to us." 







###### 15 



And all who were sitting in the [^o]Council stared at him, and they saw his face, _which was_ like the face of an angel. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Acts 8

***








###### 1 



Now Saul approved of putting [^a]Stephen to death. And on that day a great persecution [^b]began against the church in Jerusalem, and they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except for the apostles. 







###### 2 



_Some_ devout men buried Stephen, and mourned loudly for him. 







###### 3 



But Saul _began_ ravaging the church, entering house after house; and he would drag away men and women and put them in prison. ## Philip in Samaria 







###### 4 



Therefore, those who had been scattered went through _places_ [^c]preaching the word. 







###### 5 



Philip went down to the city of Samaria and _began_ proclaiming the [^d]Christ to them. 







###### 6 



The crowds were paying attention with one mind to what was being said by Philip, as they heard and saw the [^e]signs which he was performing. 







###### 7 



For _in the case of_ many who had unclean spirits, they were coming out _of them_ shouting with a loud voice; and many who had been paralyzed or limped _on crutches_ were healed. 







###### 8 



So there was much rejoicing in that city. 







###### 9 



Now a man named Simon had previously been practicing magic in the city and astonishing the people of Samaria, claiming to be someone great; 







###### 10 



and all _the people_, from small to great, were paying attention to him, saying, "This man is the Power of God that is called Great." 







###### 11 



And they were paying attention to him because for a long time he had astounded them with his magic arts. 







###### 12 



But when they believed Philip as he was preaching the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, both men and women were being baptized. 







###### 13 



Now even Simon himself believed; and after being baptized, he continued on with Philip, and as he observed signs and great miracles taking place, he was _repeatedly_ amazed. 







###### 14 



Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent them Peter and John, 







###### 15 



who came down and prayed for them that they would receive the Holy Spirit. 







###### 16 



(For He had not yet fallen upon any of them; they had simply been baptized [^f]in the name of the Lord Jesus.) 







###### 17 



Then they _began_ laying their hands on them, and they were receiving the Holy Spirit. 







###### 18 



Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money, 







###### 19 



saying, "Give this authority to me as well, so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit." 







###### 20 



But Peter said to him, "May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could acquire the gift of God with money! 







###### 21 



You have no part or share in this [^g]matter, for your heart is not right before God. 







###### 22 



Therefore, repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord _that_, if possible, the intention of your heart will be forgiven you. 







###### 23 



For I see that you are [^h]in the gall of bitterness and in the [^i]bondage of unrighteousness." 







###### 24 



But Simon answered and said, "Pray to the Lord for me yourselves, so that nothing of what you have said may come upon me." ## An Ethiopian Receives Christ 







###### 25 



So, when they had solemnly testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they started back to Jerusalem, and were preaching the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans. 







###### 26 



But an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, "Get ready and go [^j]south to the road that descends from Jerusalem to Gaza." ([^k]This is a desert _road_.) 







###### 27 



So he got ready and went; and [^l]there was an Ethiopian eunuch, a court official of [^m]Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of all her treasure; and he had come to Jerusalem to worship, 







###### 28 



and he was returning and sitting in his [^n]chariot, and was reading Isaiah the prophet. 







###### 29 



Then the Spirit said to Philip, "Go up and join this [^o]chariot." 







###### 30 



Philip ran up and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, "Do you understand what you are reading?" 







###### 31 



And he said, "Well, how could I, unless someone guides me?" And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him. 







###### 32 



Now the passage of Scripture which he was reading was this: "He was led like a sheep to slaughter; And like a lamb that is silent before its shearer, So He does not open His mouth. 







###### 33 



In humiliation His justice was taken away; Who will [^p]describe His [^q]generation? For His life is taken away from the earth." 







###### 34 



The eunuch answered Philip and said, "Please _tell me_, of whom does the prophet say this? Of himself, or of someone else?" 







###### 35 



Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this Scripture he preached Jesus to him. 







###### 36 



As they went along the road they came to some water; and the eunuch *said, "Look! Water! What prevents me from being baptized?"[^r] 







###### 38 



And he ordered that the [^s]chariot stop; and they both went down into the water, Philip as well as the eunuch, and he baptized him. 







###### 39 



When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away; and the eunuch no longer saw him, [^t]but went on his way rejoicing. 







###### 40 



But Philip [^u]found himself at [^v]Azotus, and as he passed through he kept preaching the gospel to all the cities, until he came to Caesarea. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

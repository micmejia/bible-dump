# Amos 2

***








###### 1 



This is what the LORD says: "For three offenses of Moab, and for four, I will not [^a]revoke its _punishment_, Because he burned the bones of the king of Edom to lime. 







###### 2 



So I will send fire upon Moab And it will consume the citadels of Kerioth; And Moab will die amid the panic _of battle_, Amid war cries and the sound of a trumpet. 







###### 3 



I will also eliminate the [^b]judge from her midst And slay all her leaders with him," says the LORD. ## Judgment on Judah 







###### 4 



This is what the LORD says: "For three offenses of Judah, and for four, I will not revoke its _punishment_, Because they rejected the Law of the LORD And have not kept His statutes; Their [^c]lies also have led them astray, Those which their fathers followed. 







###### 5 



So I will send fire upon Judah, And it will consume the citadels of Jerusalem." ## Judgment on Israel 







###### 6 



This is what the LORD says: "For three offenses of Israel, and for four, I will not revoke its _punishment_, Because they sell the righteous for [^d]money, And the needy for a pair of sandals. 







###### 7 



These who [^e]trample the head of the helpless to the dust of the earth Also divert the way of the humble; And a man and his father [^f]resort to the _same_ [^g]girl So as to profane My holy name. 







###### 8 



And on garments seized as pledges they stretch out beside every altar, And _in_ the house of their God they drink the wine of those who have been fined. 







###### 9 



"Yet it was I who destroyed the Amorite before them, [^h]Though his height _was_ like the height of cedars And he _was as_ strong as the oaks; I also destroyed his fruit above and his roots below. 







###### 10 



And it was I who brought you up from the land of Egypt, And led you in the wilderness for forty years So that you might take possession of the land of the Amorite. 







###### 11 



Then I raised up some of your sons to be prophets, And some of your young men to be Nazirites. Is this not so, you sons of Israel?" declares the LORD. 







###### 12 



"But you made the Nazirites drink wine, And you commanded the prophets, saying, 'You shall not prophesy!' 







###### 13 



Behold, I am making a rut _in the ground_ beneath you, Just as a wagon makes a rut when filled with sheaves. 







###### 14 



Refuge will be lost from the swift, And the strong will not strengthen his power, Nor the warrior save his [^i]life. 







###### 15 



The one who grasps the bow will not stand _his ground_, The swift of foot will not escape, Nor will the one who rides the horse save his [^j]life. 







###### 16 



Even the [^k]bravest among the warriors will flee naked on that day," declares the LORD. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Amos 3

***








###### 1 



Hear this word which the LORD has spoken against you, sons of Israel, against the entire [^a]family which [^b]He brought up from the land of Egypt: 







###### 2 



"You only have I [^c]known among all the families of the earth; Therefore I will [^d]punish you for all your wrongdoing." 







###### 3 



Do two people walk together unless they have agreed to meet? 







###### 4 



Does a lion roar in the forest when he has no prey? Does a young lion [^e]growl from his den unless he has captured _something_? 







###### 5 



Does a bird fall into a trap on the ground when there is no [^f]device in it? Does a trap spring up from the earth when it captures nothing at all? 







###### 6 



If a trumpet is blown in a city, will the people not tremble? If a disaster occurs in a city, has the LORD not brought it about? 







###### 7 



[^g]Certainly the Lord [^h]God does nothing Unless He reveals His secret plan To His servants the prophets. 







###### 8 



A lion has roared! Who will not fear? The Lord God has spoken! Who can _do anything_ but prophesy? 







###### 9 



Proclaim on the citadels in Ashdod and on the citadels in the land of Egypt and say, "Assemble yourselves on the mountains of Samaria and see _the_ great panic within her and _the_ oppressions in her midst. 







###### 10 



But they do not know how to do what is right," declares the LORD, "these who store up [^i]violence and devastation in their citadels." 







###### 11 



Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: "An enemy, one surrounding the land, Will take down your fortifications from you, And your citadels will be looted." 







###### 12 



This is what the LORD says: "Just as the shepherd [^j]snatches from the lion's mouth a couple of legs or a piece of an ear, So will the sons of Israel living in Samaria be [^k]snatched away-- With _the_ corner of a bed and _the_ [^l]cover of a couch! 







###### 13 



Hear and testify against the house of Jacob," Declares the Lord God, the God of armies. 







###### 14 



"For on the day that I punish Israel's offenses, I will also punish the altars of Bethel; The horns of the altar will be cut off, And will fall to the ground. 







###### 15 



I will also strike the winter house together with the summer house; The houses of [^m]ivory will also perish, And the great houses will come to an end," Declares the LORD. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

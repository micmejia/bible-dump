# Amos 4

***








###### 1 



Hear this word, you [^a]cows of Bashan who are on the mountain of Samaria, Who exploit the poor, who oppress the needy, [^b]And say to their [^c]husbands, "Bring now, that we may drink!" 







###### 2 



The Lord [^d]God has sworn by His holiness, "For behold, the days are coming upon you When [^e]they will take you away with _meat_ hooks, And the last of you with fish hooks. 







###### 3 



You will go out _through_ holes _in the walls_, One in front of the other, And you [^f]will be hurled to Harmon," declares the LORD. 







###### 4 



"Enter Bethel and do wrong; In Gilgal multiply wrongdoing! Bring your sacrifices every morning, Your tithes every three days. 







###### 5 



[^g]Offer a thanksgiving offering also from that which is leavened, And proclaim [^h]voluntary offerings, make them known. For so you love _to do_, you sons of Israel," Declares the Lord God. 







###### 6 



"But I gave you also cleanness of teeth in all your cities, And lack of bread in all your places; Yet you have not returned to Me," declares the LORD. 







###### 7 



"Furthermore, I withheld the rain from you While _there were_ still three months until harvest. Then I would send rain on one city, But on another city I would not send rain; One part would be rained on, While the part not rained on would dry up. 







###### 8 



So _the people of_ two _or_ three cities would stagger to another city to drink water, But would not be satisfied; Yet you have not returned to Me," declares the LORD. 







###### 9 



"I struck you with scorching _wind_ and mildew; The caterpillar was devouring Your many gardens and vineyards, fig trees and olive trees; Yet you have not returned to Me," declares the LORD. 







###### 10 



"I sent a plague among you [^i]as in Egypt; I killed your young men with the sword, along with your captured horses, And I made the stench of your camp rise up in your nostrils; Yet you have not returned to Me," declares the LORD. 







###### 11 



"I overthrew you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, And you were like a log snatched from a fire; Yet you have not returned to Me," declares the LORD. 







###### 12 



"Therefore so I will do to you, Israel; Because I will do this to you, Prepare to meet your God, Israel." 







###### 13 



For behold, He who forms mountains and creates the wind, And declares to a person what are His thoughts, He who makes dawn into darkness And treads on the high places of the earth, The LORD God of armies is His name. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

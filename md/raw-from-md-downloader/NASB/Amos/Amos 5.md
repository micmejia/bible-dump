# Amos 5

***








###### 1 



Hear this word which I am taking up for you as a song of mourning, house of Israel: 







###### 2 



She has fallen, she will not rise again-- The virgin Israel. She lies unnoticed on her land; There is no one to raise her up. 







###### 3 



For this is what the Lord [^a]God says: "The city which goes forth a thousand _strong_ Will have a hundred left, And the one which goes forth a hundred _strong_ Will have ten left to the house of Israel." 







###### 4 



For this is what the LORD says to the house of Israel: "Seek Me so that you may live. 







###### 5 



But do not [^b]resort to Bethel And do not come to Gilgal, Nor cross over to Beersheba; For Gilgal will certainly go into captivity And Bethel will [^c]come to nothing. 







###### 6 



Seek the LORD so that you may live, Or He will break through like a fire, [^d]house of Joseph, And it will consume with no one to extinguish _it_ for Bethel, 







###### 7 



_For_ those who turn justice into wormwood, And [^e]throw righteousness to the earth." 







###### 8 



He who made the Pleiades and Orion, And changes deep darkness into morning, [^f]Who also darkens day _into_ night, Who calls for the waters of the sea And pours them out on the surface of the earth, The LORD is His name. 







###### 9 



_It is_ He who makes destruction flash upon the strong, So that destruction comes upon the fortress. 







###### 10 



They hate him who rebukes in the [^g]gate, And they despise him who speaks _with_ integrity. 







###### 11 



Therefore because you impose heavy [^h]rent on the poor And take a tribute of grain from them, _Though_ you have built houses of cut stone, Yet you will not live in them; You have planted beautiful vineyards, yet you will not drink their wine. 







###### 12 



For I know your offenses are many and your sins are great, _You_ who are hostile to the righteous _and_ accept bribes, And [^i]turn away the poor _from justice_ at the [^j]gate. 







###### 13 



Therefore at [^k]such a time the prudent person keeps quiet, because it is an evil time. 







###### 14 



Seek good and not evil, so that you may live; And so may the LORD God of armies be with you, Just as you have said! 







###### 15 



Hate evil, love good, And establish justice in the [^l]gate! Perhaps the LORD God of armies Will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph. 







###### 16 



Therefore this is what the LORD God of armies, the Lord says: "There is mourning in all the public squares, And in all the streets they say, 'Oh no! Oh no!' They also call the farmer to mourning And [^m]professional mourners to mourning rites. 







###### 17 



And in all the vineyards _there is_ mourning, Because I will pass through the midst of you," says the LORD. 







###### 18 



Woe _to_ you who are longing for the day of the LORD, For what [^n]purpose _will_ the day of the LORD _be_ to you? It _will be_ darkness and not light; 







###### 19 



As when a man flees from a lion And a bear confronts him, [^o]Or he goes home, leans with his hand against the wall, And a snake bites him. 







###### 20 



_Will_ the day of the LORD not _be_ darkness instead of light, Even gloom with no brightness in it? 







###### 21 



"I hate, I reject your festivals, Nor do I [^p]delight in your festive assemblies. 







###### 22 



Even though you offer up to Me burnt offerings and your grain offerings, I will not accept _them_; And I will not _even_ look at the peace offerings of your fattened oxen. 







###### 23 



Take away from Me the noise of your songs; I will not even listen to the sound of your harps. 







###### 24 



But let justice roll out like waters, And righteousness like an ever-flowing stream. 







###### 25 



"[^q]Did you present Me with sacrifices and grain offerings in the wilderness for forty years, house of Israel? 







###### 26 



You also carried along [^r]Sikkuth your king and [^s]Kiyyun, your images, [^t]the star of your gods which you made for yourselves. 







###### 27 



Therefore I will make you go into exile beyond Damascus," says the LORD, whose name is the God of armies. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

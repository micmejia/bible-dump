# Amos 7

***








###### 1 



This is what the Lord [^a]God showed me, and behold, He was forming a swarm of locusts [^b]when the spring crop began to sprout. And behold, the spring crop _was_ after the king's mowing. 







###### 2 



And it came about, [^c]when it had finished eating the vegetation of the land, that I said, "Lord God, please pardon! How can Jacob stand? For he is small." 







###### 3 



The LORD relented of this. "It shall not be," said the LORD. 







###### 4 



So the Lord God showed me, and behold, the Lord God was calling to contend _with them_ by fire, and it consumed the great deep and _began to_ consume the [^d]farmland. 







###### 5 



Then I said, "Lord God, please stop! How can Jacob stand? For he is small." 







###### 6 



The LORD relented of this. "This too shall not be," said the Lord God. 







###### 7 



So He showed me, and behold, the Lord was standing [^e]by a [^f]vertical wall with a plumb line in His hand. 







###### 8 



And the LORD said to me, "What do you see, Amos?" And I said, "A plumb line." Then the Lord said, "Behold I am about to put a plumb line In the midst of My people Israel. I will not [^g]spare them any longer. 







###### 9 



The high places of Isaac will become deserted, And the sanctuaries of Israel will be in ruins. Then I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam with the sword." ## Amos Accused; Gives an Answer 







###### 10 



Then Amaziah, the priest of Bethel, sent _word_ to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, "Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel; the land is unable to endure all his words. 







###### 11 



For this is what Amos says: 'Jeroboam will die by the sword, and Israel will certainly go from its land into exile.'" 







###### 12 



Then Amaziah said to Amos, "Go, you seer, flee to the land of Judah; and eat bread there and do your prophesying there! 







###### 13 



But do not prophesy at Bethel any longer, for it is a sanctuary of the king and a royal [^h]residence." 







###### 14 



Then Amos replied to Amaziah, "I am not a prophet, nor am I the son of a prophet; for I am a herdsman and a [^i]grower of sycamore figs. 







###### 15 



But the LORD took me from [^j]following the flock, and the LORD said to me, 'Go prophesy to My people Israel.' 







###### 16 



So now hear the word of the LORD: you are saying, 'You shall not prophesy against Israel nor shall you [^k]prophesy against the house of Isaac.' 







###### 17 



Therefore, this is what the LORD says: 'Your wife will become a prostitute in the city, your sons and your daughters will fall by the sword, your land will be parceled up by a _measuring_ line, and you yourself will die [^l]upon unclean soil. Furthermore Israel will certainly go from its land into exile.'" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

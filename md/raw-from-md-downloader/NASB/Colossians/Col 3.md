# Colossians 3

***








###### 1 



Therefore, if you have been raised with Christ, keep seeking the things _that are_ above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. 







###### 2 



[^a]Set your minds on the things _that are_ above, not on the things that are on earth. 







###### 3 



For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. 







###### 4 



When Christ, who is our life, is revealed, then you also will be revealed with Him in glory. 







###### 5 



Therefore, [^b]treat the parts of your earthly body as dead _to_ sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and greed, which [^c]amounts to idolatry. 







###### 6 



_For it is_ because of these things _that_ the wrath of God is coming [^d]upon the [^e]sons of disobedience, 







###### 7 



and in them you also once walked, when you were living [^f]in them. 







###### 8 



But now you also, rid yourselves of all of them: anger, wrath, malice, slander, _and_ obscene speech from your mouth. 







###### 9 



[^g]Do not lie to one another, since you stripped off the old [^h]self with its _evil_ practices, 







###### 10 



and have put on the new _self_, which is being [^i]renewed to a true knowledge according to the image of the One who created it-- 







###### 11 



_a renewal_ in which there is no _distinction between_ Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, [^j]barbarian, [^k]Scythian, slave, _and_ free, but Christ is all, and in all. 







###### 12 



So, as those who have been chosen of God, holy and beloved, put on a heart of compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, _and_ [^l]patience; 







###### 13 



bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, whoever has a complaint against anyone; just as the Lord forgave you, so _must_ you _do_ also. 







###### 14 



In addition to all these things _put on_ love, which is [^m]the perfect bond of unity. 







###### 15 



Let the peace of Christ, to which you were [^n]indeed called in one body, [^o]rule in your hearts; and [^p]be thankful. 







###### 16 



Let the word of [^q]Christ richly dwell within you, [^r]with all wisdom teaching and admonishing [^s]one another with psalms, hymns, _and_ spiritual songs, singing with thankfulness in your hearts to God. 







###### 17 



Whatever you do in word or deed, _do_ everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks through Him to God the Father. ## Family Relations 







###### 18 



Wives, be subject to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. 







###### 19 



Husbands, love your wives and do not become bitter against them. 







###### 20 



Children, obey your parents in everything, for this is pleasing [^t]to the Lord. 







###### 21 



Fathers, do not [^u]antagonize your children, so that they will not become discouraged. 







###### 22 



[^v]Slaves, obey those who are your [^w]human masters in everything, not with [^x]eye-service, as people-pleasers, but with sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord. 







###### 23 



Whatever you do, do your work [^y]heartily, as for the Lord and not for people, 







###### 24 



knowing that _it is_ from the Lord _that_ you will receive the reward [^z]of the inheritance. _It is_ the Lord Christ _whom_ you serve. 







###### 25 



For the one who does wrong will receive the consequences of the wrong which he has done, and [^aa]that without partiality. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Colossians 4

***








###### 1 



Masters, grant your slaves justice and fairness, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven. 







###### 2 



Devote yourselves to prayer, keeping alert in it with _an attitude of_ thanksgiving; 







###### 3 



praying at the same time for us as well, that God will open up to us a door for the word, so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ, for which I have also been imprisoned; 







###### 4 



that I may make it clear in the way that I ought to proclaim _it_. 







###### 5 



[^a]Conduct yourselves with wisdom toward outsiders, [^b]making the most of the opportunity. 







###### 6 



Your speech _must_ always _be_ [^c]with grace, _as though_ seasoned with salt, so that you will know how you should respond to each person. 







###### 7 



As to all my affairs, Tychicus, _our_ beloved brother and faithful servant and fellow bond-servant in the Lord, will bring you information. 







###### 8 



_For_ I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know about our circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts; 







###### 9 



[^d]and with him is Onesimus, _our_ faithful and beloved brother, who is one of your _own_. They will inform you about the whole situation here. 







###### 10 



Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, sends you his greetings; and _also_ Barnabas' cousin Mark (about whom you received [^e]instructions; if he comes to you, welcome him); 







###### 11 



and _also_ Jesus who is called Justus; these are the only fellow workers for the kingdom of God who are from the circumcision, and they have proved to be an encouragement to me. 







###### 12 



Epaphras, who is one of your _own_, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, sends you his greetings, always striving earnestly for you in his prayers, that you may [^f]stand [^g]mature and [^h]fully assured in all the will of God. 







###### 13 



For I testify for him that he has [^i]a deep concern for you and for those who are in Laodicea and Hierapolis. 







###### 14 



Luke, the beloved physician, sends you his greetings, and Demas _does also_. 







###### 15 



Greet the brothers _and sisters_ who are in Laodicea and also [^j]Nympha and the church that is in [^k]her house. 







###### 16 



When [^l]this letter is read among you, have it also read in the church of the Laodiceans; and you, for your part, read [^m]my letter _that is coming_ from Laodicea. 







###### 17 



Tell Archippus, "See to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, so that you may [^n]fulfill it." 







###### 18 



[^o]I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. Remember my [^p]imprisonment. Grace be with you. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Daniel 1

***








###### 1 



In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it. 







###### 2 



And the Lord handed Jehoiakim king of Judah over to him, along with some of the vessels of the house of God; and he brought them to the land of Shinar, to the house of his [^a]god, and he brought the vessels into the treasury of his [^b]god. 







###### 3 



Then the king told Ashpenaz, the chief of his [^c]officials, to bring in some of the sons of Israel, including some of the [^d]royal family and of the nobles, 







###### 4 



youths in whom there was no impairment, who were good-looking, suitable for instruction in every _kind of_ expertise, endowed with understanding and discerning knowledge, and who had ability to [^e]serve in the king's [^f]court; and _he ordered Ashpenaz_ to teach them the [^g]literature and language of the Chaldeans. 







###### 5 



The king also allotted for them a daily ration from the king's choice food and from the wine which he drank, and _ordered_ that they be educated for three years, at the end of which they were to [^h]enter the king's personal service. 







###### 6 



Now among them from the sons of Judah were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. 







###### 7 



Then the commander of the officials assigned _new_ names to them; and to Daniel he assigned _the name_ Belteshazzar, to Hananiah Shadrach, to Mishael Meshach, and to Azariah Abed-nego. ## Daniel's Resolve 







###### 8 



But Daniel [^i]made up his mind that he would not defile himself with the king's choice food or with the wine which he drank; so he sought _permission_ from the commander of the officials that he might not defile himself. 







###### 9 



Now God granted Daniel favor and compassion in the sight of the commander of the officials. 







###### 10 



The commander of the officials said to Daniel, "I am afraid of my lord the king, who has allotted your food and your drink; for why should he see your faces looking gaunt in comparison to the youths who are your own age? Then you would [^j]make me forfeit my head to the king." 







###### 11 



But Daniel said to the overseer whom the commander of the officials had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, 







###### 12 



"Please put your servants to the test for ten days, and let us be given some vegetables to eat and water to drink. 







###### 13 



Then let our appearance be [^k]examined in your presence and the appearance of the youths who are eating the king's choice food; and deal with your servants according to what you see." 







###### 14 



So he listened to them in this matter, and put them to the test for ten days. 







###### 15 



And at the end of ten days their appearance seemed better, and [^l]they were fatter than all the youths who had been eating the king's choice food. 







###### 16 



So the overseer continued to [^m]withhold their choice food and the wine they were to drink, and kept giving them vegetables. 







###### 17 



And as for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and intelligence in every _kind of_ [^n]literature and expertise; Daniel even understood all _kinds of_ visions and dreams. 







###### 18 



Then at the end of the days which the king had [^o]specified [^p]for presenting them, the commander of the officials [^q]presented them before Nebuchadnezzar. 







###### 19 



And the king talked with them, and out of them all not one was found like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; so they [^r]entered the king's personal service. 







###### 20 



As for every matter of expertise [^s]and understanding about which the king consulted them, he found them ten times better than all the soothsayer priests _and_ conjurers who _were_ in all his realm. 







###### 21 



And Daniel [^t]continued until the first year of Cyrus the king. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

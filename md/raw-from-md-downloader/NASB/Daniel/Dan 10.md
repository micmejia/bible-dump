# Daniel 10

***








###### 1 



In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia, a [^a]message was revealed to Daniel, who was named Belteshazzar; and the [^b]message was true and _it concerned_ great [^c]conflict, but he understood the [^d]message and had an understanding of the vision. 







###### 2 



In those days, I, Daniel, had been mourning for three [^e]entire weeks. 







###### 3 



I did not eat any [^f]tasty food, nor did meat or wine enter my mouth, nor did I use any ointment at all until the entire three weeks were completed. 







###### 4 



On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, while I was by the bank of the great river, that is, the [^g]Tigris, 







###### 5 



I raised my eyes and looked, and behold, there was a man dressed in linen, whose waist had a belt of pure gold of Uphaz. 







###### 6 



His body also _was_ like topaz, his face [^h]had the appearance of lightning, his eyes were like flaming torches, his arms and feet like the gleam of polished bronze, and the sound of his words like the sound of a multitude. 







###### 7 



Now I, Daniel, alone saw the vision, while the men who were with me did not see the vision; nevertheless, a great fear fell on them, and they ran away to hide themselves. 







###### 8 



So I was left alone and saw this great vision; yet no strength was left in me, for my complexion turned to [^i]a deathly pallor, and I retained no strength. 







###### 9 



But I heard the sound of his words; and as soon as I heard the sound of his words, I fell into a deep sleep on my face, with my face to the ground. ## Daniel Comforted 







###### 10 



Then behold, a hand touched me and shook me on my [^j]hands and knees. 







###### 11 



And he said to me, "Daniel, [^k]you who are treasured, understand the words that I am about to tell you and stand at your place, for I have now been sent to you." And when he had spoken this word to me, I stood up trembling. 







###### 12 



Then he said to me, "Do not be afraid, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart on understanding _this_ and on humbling yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come in _response to_ your words. 







###### 13 



But the prince of the kingdom of Persia was standing [^l]in my way for twenty-one days; then behold, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, for I had been left there with the kings of Persia. 







###### 14 



Now I have come to explain to you what will happen to your people in the [^m]latter days, because the vision _pertains_ to the days still _future_." 







###### 15 



When he had spoken to me according to these words, I [^n]turned my face toward the ground and became speechless. 







###### 16 



And behold, [^o]one who resembled a human was touching my lips. Then I opened my mouth and spoke and said to him who was standing before me, "My lord, due to the vision [^p]anguish has come upon me, and I have retained no strength. 







###### 17 



For how can such a servant of my lord talk with such as my lord? As for me, there remains just now no strength in me, nor has any breath been left in me." 







###### 18 



Then _this_ one with human appearance touched me again and strengthened me. 







###### 19 



And he said, "[^q]You who are treasured, do not be afraid. Peace _be_ to you; take courage and be courageous!" Now as soon as he spoke to me, I felt strengthened and said, "May my lord speak, for you have strengthened me." 







###### 20 



Then he said, "Do you [^r]understand why I came to you? But I shall now return to fight against the prince of Persia; so I am leaving, and behold, the prince of [^s]Greece is about to come. 







###### 21 



However, I will tell you what is recorded in the writing of truth. Yet there is no one who [^t]stands firmly with me against these _forces_ except Michael your prince. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

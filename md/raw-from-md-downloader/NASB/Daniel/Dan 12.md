# Daniel 12

***








###### 1 



"Now at that time Michael, the great prince who stands _guard_ over the sons of your people, will arise. And there will be a time of distress such as never occurred since there was a nation until that time; and at that time your people, everyone who is found written in the book, will be rescued. 







###### 2 



And many of those who sleep in the dust of the ground will awake, these to everlasting life, but the others to disgrace _and_ everlasting [^a]contempt. 







###### 3 



And [^b]those who have insight will shine like the glow of the [^c]expanse of heaven, and those who [^d]lead the many to righteousness, like the stars forever and ever. 







###### 4 



But as for you, Daniel, keep these words secret and seal up the book until the end of time; many will roam about, and knowledge will increase." 







###### 5 



Then I, Daniel, looked, and behold, two others were standing, one on this bank of the stream and the other on that bank of the stream. 







###### 6 



And _someone_ said to the man dressed in linen, who was above the waters of the stream, "How long _will it be_ until the end of _these_ wonders?" 







###### 7 



And I heard the man dressed in linen, who was above the waters of the stream, [^e]as he raised his right hand and his left toward heaven, and swore by Him who lives forever that _it would be_ for a [^f]time, [^g]times, and half _a_ [^h]_time_; and as soon as [^i]they finish smashing the [^j]power of the holy people, all these _events_ will be completed. 







###### 8 



But as for me, I heard but did not understand; so I said, "My lord, what _will be_ the [^k]outcome of these _events_?" 







###### 9 



And he said, "Go _your way_, Daniel, for _these_ words _will be_ kept secret and sealed up until the end time. 







###### 10 



Many will be purged, [^l]cleansed, and refined, but the wicked will act wickedly; and none of the wicked will understand, but [^m]those who have insight will understand. 







###### 11 



And from the time that the regular sacrifice is abolished and the abomination [^n]of desolation is set up, _there will be_ 1,290 days. 







###### 12 



Blessed is the one who is patient and attains to the 1,335 days! 







###### 13 



But as for you, go _your way_ to the [^o]end; then you will rest and [^p]rise for your allotted portion at the end of the [^q]age." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

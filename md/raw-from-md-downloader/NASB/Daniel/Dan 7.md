# Daniel 7

***








###### 1 



In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream and visions [^a]in his mind _as he lay_ on his bed; then he wrote the dream down _and_ told the [^b]_following_ summary of [^c]it. 







###### 2 



Daniel [^d]said, "I was looking in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea. 







###### 3 



And four great beasts were coming up from the sea, different from one another. 







###### 4 



The first _was_ like a lion but had _the_ wings of an eagle. I kept looking until its wings were plucked, and it was lifted up from the ground and set up on two feet like a man; a human [^e]mind also was given to it. 







###### 5 



And behold, another beast, a second one, resembling a bear. And it was raised up on one side, and three ribs _were_ in its mouth between its teeth; and they said this to it: 'Arise, devour much meat!' 







###### 6 



After this I kept looking, and behold, another one, like a leopard, which had on its [^f]back four wings of a bird; the beast also had four heads, and dominion was given to it. 







###### 7 



After this I kept looking in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and extremely strong; and it had large iron teeth. It devoured and crushed, and trampled down the remainder with its feet; and it was different from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns. 







###### 8 



While I was thinking about the horns, behold, another horn, a little one, came up among them, and three of the previous horns were plucked out before it; and behold, [^g]this horn possessed eyes like human eyes, and a mouth uttering great _boasts_. ## The Ancient of Days Reigns 







###### 9 



"I kept looking Until thrones were set up, And the Ancient of Days took _His_ seat; His garment _was_ white as snow, And the hair of His head like pure wool. His throne _was_ [^h]ablaze with flames, Its wheels _were_ a burning fire. 







###### 10 



A river of fire was flowing And coming out from before Him; Thousands upon thousands were serving Him, And myriads upon myriads were standing before Him; The court [^i]convened, And the books were opened. 







###### 11 



Then I kept looking because of the sound of the [^j]boastful words which the horn was speaking; I kept looking until the beast was killed, and its body was destroyed and given to the burning [^k]fire. 







###### 12 



As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, but an extension of life was granted to them for an appointed period of time. ## The Son of Man Presented 







###### 13 



"I kept looking in the night visions, And behold, with the clouds of heaven One like a son of man was coming, And He came up to the Ancient of Days And was presented before Him. 







###### 14 



And to Him was given dominion, Honor, and [^l]a kingdom, So that all the peoples, nations, and _populations of all_ [^m]languages Might serve Him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion Which will not pass away; And His kingdom is one Which will not be destroyed. ## The Vision Interpreted 







###### 15 



"As for me, Daniel, my spirit was distressed within [^n]me, and the visions [^o]in my mind kept alarming me. 







###### 16 



I approached one of those who were standing by and began requesting of him the [^p]exact meaning of all this. So he told me and made known to me the interpretation of these things: 







###### 17 



'These great beasts, which are four _in number_, are four kings _who_ will arise from the earth. 







###### 18 



But the [^q]saints of the Highest One will receive the kingdom and take possession of the kingdom forever, [^r]for all ages to come.' 







###### 19 



"Then I desired to know the [^s]exact meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all [^t]the others, exceedingly dreadful, with its teeth of iron and its claws of bronze, _and which_ devoured, crushed, and trampled down the remainder with its feet, 







###### 20 



and _the meaning_ of the ten horns that _were_ on its head, and the other _horn_ which came up, and before which three _of the horns_ fell, namely, that horn which had eyes and a mouth uttering great _boasts_, and [^u]which was larger in appearance than its associates. 







###### 21 



I kept looking, and that horn was waging war with the [^v]saints and prevailing against them, 







###### 22 



until the Ancient of Days came and judgment was [^w]passed in favor of the [^x]saints of the Highest One, and the time arrived when the [^y]saints took possession of the kingdom. 







###### 23 



"This is what he said: 'The fourth beast will be a fourth kingdom on the earth which will be different from all the _other_ kingdoms, and will devour the whole earth and trample it down and crush it. 







###### 24 



As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings will arise; and another will arise after them, and he will be different from the previous ones and will [^z]humble three kings. 







###### 25 



And he will [^aa]speak against the Most High and wear down the [^ab]saints of the Highest One, and he will intend to make alterations in times and in law; and [^ac]they will be handed over to him for a [^ad]time, [^ae]times, and half a [^af]time. 







###### 26 



But the court will [^ag]convene _for judgment_, and his dominion will be taken away, [^ah]annihilated and destroyed [^ai]forever. 







###### 27 



Then the [^aj]sovereignty, the dominion, and the greatness of _all_ the kingdoms under the whole heaven will be given to the people of the [^ak]saints of the Highest One; His kingdom _will be_ an everlasting kingdom, and all the empires will serve and obey Him.' 







###### 28 



"[^al]At this point the revelation ended. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts were greatly alarming me and my [^am]face became pale, but I kept the matter [^an]to myself." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

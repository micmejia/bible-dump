# Daniel 8

***








###### 1 



In the third year of the reign of Belshazzar the king, a vision appeared to me, [^a]Daniel, subsequent to the one which appeared to me [^b]previously. 







###### 2 



I looked in the vision, and while I was looking, I was in the citadel of Susa, which is in the province of Elam; and I looked in the vision, and I myself was beside the Ulai Canal. 







###### 3 



Then I raised my eyes and looked, and behold, a ram which had two horns was standing in front of the canal. Now the two horns _were_ [^c]long, but one _was_ [^d]longer than the other, with the [^e]longer one coming up last. 







###### 4 



I saw the ram butting westward, northward, and southward, and no _other_ beasts could stand against him nor was there anyone to rescue from his [^f]power, but he did as he pleased and made himself great. 







###### 5 



While I was observing, behold, a male goat was coming from the west over the surface of the entire earth without touching the ground; and the goat _had_ a prominent horn between his eyes. 







###### 6 



He came up to the ram that had the two horns, which I had seen standing in front of the canal, and rushed at him in his mighty wrath. 







###### 7 



And I saw him come up beside the ram, and he was enraged at him; and he struck the ram and smashed his two horns, and the ram had no strength to withstand him. So he hurled him to the ground and trampled on him, and there was no one to rescue the ram from his [^g]power. 







###### 8 



Then the male goat made himself exceedingly great. But once he became powerful, the large horn was broken; and in its place four prominent _horns_ came up toward the four winds of heaven. ## The Little Horn 







###### 9 



And out of one of them came a rather small horn which grew exceedingly great toward the south, toward the east, and toward the [^h]Beautiful _Land_. 







###### 10 



It grew up to the heavenly [^i]lights, and some of the [^j]lights, [^k]that is, some of the stars it threw down to the earth, and it trampled them. 







###### 11 



It even exalted itself [^l]to be equal with the [^m]Commander of the army; and it removed the regular sacrifice from Him, and the place of His sanctuary was overthrown. 







###### 12 



And because of [^n]an offense the army will be given _to the horn_ along with the regular sacrifice; and it will hurl truth to the ground and do _as it pleases_ and be successful. 







###### 13 



Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to that particular one who was speaking, "How long will the vision _about_ the regular sacrifice _apply_, [^o]while the offense causes horror, so as to allow both the sanctuary and the army [^p]to be trampled?" 







###### 14 



And he said to me, "For 2,300 evenings _and_ mornings; then the sanctuary will be [^q]properly restored." ## Interpretation of the Vision 







###### 15 



When I, Daniel, had seen the vision, I sought [^r]to understand it; and behold, standing before me was one [^s]who looked like a man. 







###### 16 



And I heard the voice of a man between _the banks of_ Ulai, and he called out and said, "Gabriel, explain the vision to this _man_." 







###### 17 



So he came near to where I was standing, and when he came I was frightened and fell on my face; and he said to me, "Son of man, understand that the vision _pertains_ to the time of the end." 







###### 18 



Now while he was talking with me, I was dazed with my face to the ground; but he touched me and made me stand at my place. 







###### 19 



And he said, "Behold, I am going to inform you of what will occur at the final period of the indignation, because _it pertains_ to the appointed time of the end. ## The Ram's Identity 







###### 20 



The ram which you saw with the two horns _represents_ the kings of Media and Persia. ## The Goat 







###### 21 



The shaggy [^t]goat _represents_ the [^u]kingdom of Greece, and the large horn that is between his eyes is the first king. 







###### 22 



The broken _horn_ and the four _horns that_ came up in its place _represent_ four kingdoms _which_ will arise from _his_ nation, although not with his power. 







###### 23 



And in the latter period of their [^v]dominion, When the wrongdoers have [^w]run _their course_, A king will arise, [^x]Insolent and skilled in [^y]intrigue. 







###### 24 



And his power will be mighty, but not by his _own_ power, And he will [^z]destroy to an extraordinary degree And be successful and do _as he pleases_; He will [^aa]destroy mighty men and [^ab]the holy people. 







###### 25 



And through his shrewdness He will make deceit a success by his [^ac]influence; And he will make himself great in his [^ad]own mind, And he will [^ae]destroy many while _they are_ [^af]at ease. He will even [^ag]oppose the Prince of princes, But he will be broken without [^ah]human agency. 







###### 26 



And the vision of the evenings and mornings Which has been told is true; But as for you, keep the vision secret, Because _it pertains_ to many days _in the future_." 







###### 27 



Then I, Daniel, was [^ai]exhausted and sick for days. Then I got up and carried on the king's business; but I was astounded at the vision, and there was no one to explain _it_. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

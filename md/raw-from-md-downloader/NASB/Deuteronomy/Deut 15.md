# Deuteronomy 15

***








###### 1 



"At the end of _every_ seven years you shall [^a]grant a release of debts. 







###### 2 



And this is the regulation for the release of debts: every creditor is to forgive what he has loaned to his neighbor; he shall not require it of his neighbor and his brother, because the LORD's release has been proclaimed. 







###### 3 



From a foreigner you may require _it_, but your hand shall [^b]forgive whatever of yours is with your brother. 







###### 4 



However, there will be no poor among you, since the LORD will certainly bless you in the land which the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance to possess, 







###### 5 



if only you listen obediently to the voice of the LORD your God, to [^c]follow carefully all this commandment which I am commanding you today. 







###### 6 



For the LORD your God will have blessed you just as He has promised you, and you will lend to many nations, but you will not borrow; and you will rule over many nations, but they will not rule over you. 







###### 7 



"If there is a poor person among you, one of your brothers, in any of your [^d]towns in your land which the LORD your God is giving you, you shall not harden your heart, nor close your hand from your poor brother; 







###### 8 



but you shall fully open your hand to him, and generously lend him enough for his need _in_ whatever he lacks. 







###### 9 



Be careful that there is no mean-spirited [^e]thought in your heart, [^f]such as, 'The seventh year, the year of release of debts, is near,' and your eye is malicious toward your poor brother, and you give him nothing; then he may cry out to the LORD against you, and it will be a sin in you. 







###### 10 



You shall generously give to him, and your heart shall not be [^g]grudging when you give to him, because for this thing the LORD your God will bless you in all your work, and in all [^h]your undertakings. 







###### 11 



For the poor will not cease [^i]to exist in the land; therefore I am commanding you, saying, 'You shall fully open your hand to your brother, to your needy and poor in your land.' 







###### 12 



"If your fellow countryman, a Hebrew man or woman, is sold to you, then he shall serve you for six years, but in the seventh year you shall set him [^j]free. 







###### 13 



And when you set him [^k]free, you shall not send him away empty-handed. 







###### 14 



You shall give generously to him from your flock, your threshing floor, and from your wine vat; you shall give to him as the LORD your God has blessed you. 







###### 15 



And you are to remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God redeemed you; therefore I am commanding [^l]this of you today. 







###### 16 



But it shall come about, if he says to you, 'I will not leave you,' because he loves you and your household, since he is doing well with you, 







###### 17 



then you shall take an [^m]awl and pierce it through his ear into the door, and he shall be your servant permanently. You shall also do the same to your female slave. 







###### 18 



"It shall not seem difficult for you when you set him [^n]free, because he has given you six years _with_ double the [^o]service of a hired worker; so the LORD your God will bless you in whatever you do. 







###### 19 



"You shall consecrate to the LORD your God all the firstborn males that are born in your herd and in your flock; you shall not work with the firstborn of your herd, nor shear the firstborn of your flock. 







###### 20 



You and your household shall eat it every year before the LORD your God in the place which the LORD chooses. 







###### 21 



But if it has any impairment, _such as_ a limp, or blindness, _or_ any serious impairment, you shall not sacrifice it to the LORD your God. 







###### 22 



You shall eat it within your gates; the unclean and the clean alike _may eat it_, as a gazelle or a deer. 







###### 23 



Only you shall not eat its blood; you are to pour it out on the ground like water. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

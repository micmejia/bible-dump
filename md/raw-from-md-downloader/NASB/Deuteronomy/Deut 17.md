# Deuteronomy 17

***








###### 1 



"You shall not sacrifice to the LORD your God an ox or a sheep which has a blemish _or_ any [^a]defect, for that is a detestable thing to the LORD your God. 







###### 2 



"If there is found in your midst, in any of your [^b]towns which the LORD your God is giving you, a man or a woman who does what is evil in the sight of the LORD your God, by violating His covenant, 







###### 3 



and _that person_ has gone and served other gods and worshiped them, or the sun, the moon, or any of the heavenly [^c]lights, which I have commanded not to do, 







###### 4 



and if it is reported to you and you have heard _about it_, then you shall investigate thoroughly. And [^d]if it is true and the report is trustworthy that this detestable thing has been done in Israel, 







###### 5 



then you are to bring out to your gates that man or woman who has done this evil deed, _that is_, the man or the woman, and you shall stone them to [^e]death. 







###### 6 



On the [^f]testimony of two witnesses or three witnesses, the [^g]condemned shall be put to death; he shall not be put to death on the [^h]testimony of _only_ one witness. 







###### 7 



The hands of the witnesses shall be first against him to put him to death, and afterward the hands of all the people. So you shall eliminate the evil from your midst. 







###### 8 



"If a case is too difficult for you to decide, between [^i]one kind of homicide or another, between [^j]one kind of lawsuit or another, and between [^k]one kind of assault or another, _that are_ cases of dispute in your [^l]courts, then you shall arise and go up to the place which the LORD your God chooses. 







###### 9 



So you shall come to the Levitical priests or the judge who is _in office_ in those days, and you shall inquire _of them_ and they will declare to you the [^m]verdict. 







###### 10 



Then you shall act in accordance with the [^n]terms of the verdict which they declare to you from that place which the LORD chooses; and you shall be careful to act in accordance with everything that they instruct you _to do_. 







###### 11 



In accordance with the [^o]terms of the law about which they instruct you, and in accordance with the verdict which they tell you, you shall act; you shall not turn aside from the word which they declare to you, to the right or the left. 







###### 12 



But the person who acts insolently by not listening to the priest who stands there to serve the LORD your God, nor to the judge, that person shall die; so you shall eliminate the evil from Israel. 







###### 13 



Then all the people will hear and be afraid, and will not act insolently again. 







###### 14 



"When you enter the land which the LORD your God is giving you, and you take possession of it and live in it, and you say, 'I will appoint a king over me like all the nations who are around me,' 







###### 15 



you shall in fact appoint a king over you whom the LORD your God chooses. _One_ from among your countrymen you shall appoint as king over yourselves; you may not put a foreigner over yourselves, _anyone_ who is not your countryman. 







###### 16 



In any case, he is not to acquire many horses for himself, nor shall he make the people return to Egypt in order to acquire many horses, since the LORD has said to you, 'You shall never again return that way.' 







###### 17 



And he shall not acquire many wives for himself, so that his heart does not turn away; nor shall he greatly increase silver and gold for himself. 







###### 18 



"Now it shall come about, when he sits on the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write for himself a copy of this Law on a scroll [^p]in the presence of the Levitical priests. 







###### 19 



And it shall be with him, and he shall read it all the days of his life, so that he will learn to fear the LORD his God, [^q]by carefully following all the words of this Law and these statutes, 







###### 20 



so that his heart will not be haughty toward his countrymen, and that he will not turn away from the commandment to the right or the left, so that he and his sons may [^r]live long in his kingdom in the midst of Israel. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

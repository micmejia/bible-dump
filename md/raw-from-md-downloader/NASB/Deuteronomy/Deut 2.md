# Deuteronomy 2

***








###### 1 



"Then we turned and set out for the wilderness by the way of the [^a]Red Sea, as the LORD spoke to me, and we circled Mount Seir for many days. 







###### 2 



And the LORD spoke to me, saying, 







###### 3 



'You have circled this mountain long enough. _Now_ turn north, 







###### 4 



and command the people, saying, "You are going to pass through the territory of your brothers the sons of Esau, who live in Seir; and they will be afraid of you. So be very careful; 







###### 5 



do not [^b]provoke them, for I will not give you any of their land, _not even_ as much as a [^c]footprint, because I have given Mount Seir to Esau as a possession. 







###### 6 



You are to buy food from them with money so that you may eat, and you shall also purchase water from them with money so that you may drink. 







###### 7 



For the LORD your God has blessed you in all [^d]that you have done; He has known your [^e]wandering through this great wilderness. These forty years the LORD your God has been with you; you have not lacked anything."' 







###### 8 



"So we passed beyond our brothers the sons of Esau, who live in Seir, away from the Arabah road, away from Elath and Ezion-geber. And we turned and passed through by the way of the wilderness of Moab. 







###### 9 



Then the LORD said to me, 'Do not attack Moab, nor provoke them to war, for I will not give you any of [^f]their land as a possession, because I have given Ar to the sons of Lot as a possession.' 







###### 10 



(The Emim lived there previously, a people as great, numerous, and tall as the Anakim. 







###### 11 



Like the Anakim, they too are regarded as Rephaim, but the Moabites call them Emim. 







###### 12 



The Horites previously lived in Seir, but the sons of Esau dispossessed them and destroyed them from before [^g]them, and settled in their place; just as Israel did to the land of [^h]their possession which the LORD gave them.) 







###### 13 



'Now arise and cross over the [^i]Wadi Zered yourselves.' So we crossed over the [^j]Wadi Zered. 







###### 14 



Now the [^k]time that it took for us to come from Kadesh-barnea until we crossed over the [^l]Wadi Zered was thirty-eight years, until all the generation of the men of war perished from within the camp, just as the LORD had sworn to them. 







###### 15 



Indeed, the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from within the camp until they all perished. 







###### 16 



"So it came about, when all the men of war had finally perished from among the people, 







###### 17 



that the LORD spoke to me, saying, 







###### 18 



'Today you shall cross over Ar, the border of Moab. 







###### 19 



When you come opposite the sons of Ammon, do not attack them nor provoke them, for I will not give you any of the land of the sons of Ammon as a possession, because I have given it to the sons of Lot as a possession.' 







###### 20 



(It is also regarded as the land of the Rephaim, _because the_ Rephaim previously lived in it, but the Ammonites call them Zamzummin, 







###### 21 



a people as great, numerous, and tall as the Anakim; but the LORD destroyed them before [^m]them. And they dispossessed them and settled in their place, 







###### 22 



just as He did for the sons of Esau, who live in Seir, when He destroyed the Horites from before them; they dispossessed them and settled in their place, _where they remain_ even to this day. 







###### 23 



And _as for_ the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the [^n]Caphtorim, who came from [^o]Caphtor, destroyed them and lived in their place.) 







###### 24 



'Arise, set out, and pass through the [^p]Valley of Arnon. Look! I have handed over to you Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land; start taking possession and plunge into battle with him. 







###### 25 



This day I will begin to put the dread and fear of you upon the faces of [^q]people everywhere, [^r]who, when they hear the news of you, will tremble and be in anguish because of you.' 







###### 26 



"So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying, 







###### 27 



'Let me pass through your land; I will [^s]travel only on the road. I will not turn aside to the right or to the left. 







###### 28 



You will sell me food for money so that I may eat, and give me water for money so that I may drink, only let me pass through on [^t]foot, 







###### 29 



just as the sons of Esau who live in Seir and the Moabites who live in Ar did for me, until I cross over the Jordan into the land that the LORD our God is giving us.' 







###### 30 



But Sihon king of Heshbon was not willing for us to pass [^u]through his land; for the LORD your God hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate, in order to hand him over to you, as _he is_ today. 







###### 31 



And the LORD said to me, 'See, I have begun to turn Sihon and his land over [^v]to you. Begin taking possession, so that you may possess his land.' 







###### 32 



"Then Sihon came out [^w]with all his people to meet us in battle at Jahaz. 







###### 33 



And the LORD our God turned him over [^x]to us, and we [^y]defeated him with his sons and all his people. 







###### 34 



So we captured all his cities at that time and [^z]utterly destroyed [^aa]the men, women, and children of every city. We left no survivor. 







###### 35 



We took only the animals as our plunder, and the spoils of the cities which we had captured. 







###### 36 



From Aroer which is on the edge of the [^ab]Valley of Arnon and _from_ the city which is in the [^ac]valley, even to Gilead, there was no city that was too [^ad]high for us; the LORD our God turned it all over [^ae]to us. 







###### 37 



Only you did not go near the land of the sons of Ammon, all along the [^af]river Jabbok and the cities of the hill country, and wherever the LORD our God had commanded us _to avoid_. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

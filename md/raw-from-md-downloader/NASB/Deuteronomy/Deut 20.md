# Deuteronomy 20

***








###### 1 



"When you go out to battle against your enemies and see horses, chariots, _and_ people more numerous than you, do not be afraid of them; for the LORD your God, who brought you up from the land of Egypt, is with you. 







###### 2 



When you are approaching the battle, the priest shall come forward and speak to the people. 







###### 3 



He shall say to them, 'Hear, Israel, you are approaching the battle against your enemies today. Do not be fainthearted. Do not be afraid, or panic, or be terrified by them, 







###### 4 



for the LORD your God is the One who is going with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.' 







###### 5 



The officers also shall speak to the people, saying, 'Who is the man that has built a new house but has not dedicated it? Let him go and return to his house, otherwise he might die in the battle and another man would dedicate it. 







###### 6 



And who is the man that has planted a vineyard but has not [^a]put it to use? Let him go and return to his house, otherwise he might die in the battle and another man [^b]would put it to use. 







###### 7 



And who is the man that is [^c]betrothed to a woman and has not [^d]married her? Let him go and return to his house, otherwise he might die in the battle and another man would [^e]marry her.' 







###### 8 



Then the officers shall speak further to the people and say, 'Who is the man that is afraid and fainthearted? Let him go and return to his house, so that [^f]he does not make his brothers' hearts melt like his heart!' 







###### 9 



And when the officers have finished speaking to the people, they shall appoint commanders of armies at the head of the people. 







###### 10 



"When you approach a city to fight against it, you shall [^g]offer it terms of peace. 







###### 11 



And if it [^h]agrees to make peace with you and opens to you, then all the people who are found in it shall become your forced labor and serve you. 







###### 12 



However, if it does not make peace with you, but makes war against you, then you shall besiege it. 







###### 13 



When the LORD your God gives it into your hand, you shall strike all the [^i]men in it with the edge of the sword. 







###### 14 



However, the women, the children, the animals, and everything that is in the city, all of its spoils, you shall take as plunder for yourself; and you shall [^j]use the spoils of your enemies which the LORD your God has given you. 







###### 15 



This is what you shall do to all the cities that are very far from you, which are not of the cities of these nations [^k]nearby. 







###### 16 



Only in the cities of these peoples that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance, you shall not leave anything that breathes alive. 







###### 17 



Instead, you shall [^l]utterly destroy them, the Hittite and the Amorite, the Canaanite and the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite, just as the LORD your God has commanded you, 







###### 18 



so that they will not teach you to do [^m]all the same detestable practices of theirs which they have done for their gods, [^n]by which you would sin against the LORD your God. 







###### 19 



"When you besiege a city for a long time, to make war against it in order to capture it, you shall not destroy its trees by swinging an axe against them; for you may eat from them, so you shall not cut them down. For [^o]is the tree of the field a human, that it should [^p]be besieged by you? 







###### 20 



Only the trees that you know [^q]are not fruit trees you shall destroy and cut down, so that you may construct siegeworks against the city that is making war against you until it falls. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

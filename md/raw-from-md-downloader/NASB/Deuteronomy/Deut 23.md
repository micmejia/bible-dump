# Deuteronomy 23

***








###### 1 



"No one who is [^a]emasculated or has his male organ cut off may enter the assembly of the LORD. 







###### 2 



No one of illegitimate birth may enter the assembly of the LORD; none of his _descendants_, even to the tenth generation, may enter the assembly of the LORD. 







###### 3 



No Ammonite or Moabite may enter the assembly of the LORD; none of their _descendants_, even to the tenth generation, may ever enter the assembly of the LORD, 







###### 4 



because they did not meet you with [^b]food and water on the way when you came out of Egypt, and because they hired against you Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of [^c]Mesopotamia, to curse you. 







###### 5 



Nevertheless, the LORD your God was unwilling to listen to Balaam, but the LORD your God turned the curse into a blessing for you because the LORD your God loves you. 







###### 6 



You shall never seek their peace or their prosperity all your days. 







###### 7 



"You shall not loathe an [^d]Edomite, for he is your brother; you shall not loathe an Egyptian, because you were a stranger in his land. 







###### 8 



The sons of the third generation who are born to them may enter the assembly of the LORD. 







###### 9 



"When you go out as [^e]an army against your enemies, you shall be on guard against every evil thing. 







###### 10 



"If there is among you any man who is unclean because of a nocturnal emission, then he must go outside the camp; he may not [^f]reenter the camp. 







###### 11 



But when evening approaches, he shall bathe himself with water, and at sundown he may [^g]reenter the camp. 







###### 12 



"You shall also have a place _allocated_ outside the camp, so that you may go out there _to relieve yourself_, 







###### 13 



and you shall have a [^h]spade among your tools, and it shall be when you sit down outside, you shall dig with it and shall turn and cover up your excrement. 







###### 14 



Since the LORD your God walks in the midst of your camp to save you and to [^i]defeat your enemies before you, your camp must be holy; so He must not see [^j]anything indecent among you [^k]or He will turn away from you. 







###### 15 



"You shall not hand over to his master a slave who has [^l]escaped from his master to you. 







###### 16 



He shall live with you in your midst, in the place that he chooses in one of your [^m]towns where it pleases him; you shall not mistreat him. 







###### 17 



"None of the daughters of Israel shall be a cult prostitute, nor shall any of the sons of Israel be a cult prostitute. 







###### 18 



You shall not bring the earnings of a prostitute or the money for a [^n]dog into the house of the LORD your God _as payment_ for any vowed offering, because both of these are an abomination to the LORD your God. 







###### 19 



"You are not to charge interest to your countrymen: interest on money, food, _or_ anything that may be loaned on interest. 







###### 20 



You may charge interest to a foreigner, but to your countrymen you shall not charge interest, so that the LORD your God may bless you in all [^o]that you undertake in the land which you are about to enter to [^p]possess. 







###### 21 



"When you make a vow to the LORD your God, you shall not delay to pay it, for the LORD your God will certainly require it of you, and it will be a sin [^q]for you. 







###### 22 



However, if you refrain from making vows, it will not be a sin [^r]for you. 







###### 23 



You shall be careful and perform what goes out of your lips, since in fact you have vowed a [^s]voluntary offering to the LORD your God, whatever you have [^t]promised. 







###### 24 



"When you enter your neighbor's vineyard, you may eat grapes [^u]until you are satisfied; but you are not to put _any_ in your [^v]basket. 







###### 25 



"When you enter your neighbor's standing grain, you may pluck the heads of grain with your hand, but you are not to [^w]use a sickle on your neighbor's standing grain. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

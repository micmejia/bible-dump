# Deuteronomy 24

***








###### 1 



"When a man takes a wife and marries her, and it happens, if she finds no favor in his eyes because he has found some indecency in her, that he writes her a certificate of divorce, puts _it_ in her hand, and [^a]sends her away from his house, 







###### 2 



and she leaves his house and goes and becomes another man's _wife_, 







###### 3 



and the latter husband [^b]turns against her, writes her a certificate of divorce and puts _it_ in her hand, and [^c]sends her away from his house, or if the latter husband who took her to be his wife dies, 







###### 4 



_then_ her former husband who [^d]sent her away is not allowed to take her again to be his wife, after [^e]she has been defiled; for that is an abomination before the LORD, and you shall not bring sin on the land which the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance. 







###### 5 



"When a man takes a new wife, he is not to go out with the army, nor be assigned any duty; he shall be free at home for one year and shall make his wife whom he has taken happy. ## Various Laws 







###### 6 



"No one shall seize a handmill or an upper millstone as a pledge _for a loan_, since he would be seizing _the debtor's_ [^f]means of life as a pledge. 







###### 7 



"If someone is [^g]caught kidnapping any of his countrymen of the sons of Israel, and he treats him as merchandise and sells him, then that thief shall die; so you shall eliminate the evil from among you. 







###### 8 



"Be careful about an infestation of leprosy, that you are very attentive and act in accordance with everything that the Levitical priests teach you; just as I have commanded them, you shall be careful to act. 







###### 9 



Remember what the LORD your God did to Miriam on the way as you came out of Egypt. 







###### 10 



"When you make your neighbor a loan of any kind, you shall not enter his house to take his pledge. 







###### 11 



You shall stand outside, and the person to whom you are making the loan shall bring the pledge outside to you. 







###### 12 



And if he is a poor man, you shall not sleep with his pledge. 







###### 13 



When the sun goes down you shall certainly return the pledge to him, so that he may sleep in his cloak and bless you; and it will be righteousness for you before the LORD your God. 







###### 14 



"You shall not exploit a hired worker _who is_ poor and needy, whether _he is_ one of your countrymen or one of your strangers who are in your land in your [^h]towns. 







###### 15 



You shall give him his wages on his day [^i]before the sun sets--for he is poor and sets his [^j]heart on it--so that he does not cry out against you to the LORD, and it becomes a sin in you. 







###### 16 



"Fathers shall not be put to death for _their_ sons, nor shall sons be put to death for _their_ fathers; everyone shall be put to death for his own sin _alone_. 







###### 17 



"You shall not pervert the justice [^k]due a stranger _or_ [^l]an orphan, nor seize a widow's garment as a [^m]pledge. 







###### 18 



But you are to remember that you were a slave in Egypt, and that the LORD your God redeemed you from there; therefore I am commanding you to do this thing. 







###### 19 



"When you reap your harvest in your field and forget a sheaf in the field, you are not to go back to get it; it shall belong to the stranger, the [^n]orphan, and to the widow, in order that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of your hands. 







###### 20 



When you beat _the olives_ off your olive tree, you are not to search through the branches [^o]again; _that_ shall be _left_ for the stranger, the [^p]orphan, and for the widow. 







###### 21 



"When you gather the grapes of your vineyard, you are not to [^q]go over it again; _that_ shall be _left_ for the stranger, the [^r]orphan, and the widow. 







###### 22 



And you shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt; therefore I am commanding you to do this thing. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

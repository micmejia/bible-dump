# Deuteronomy 30

***








###### 1 



"So it will be when all of these things have come upon you, the blessing and the curse which I have placed before you, and you [^a]call _them_ to mind in all the nations where the LORD your God has scattered you, 







###### 2 



and you return to the LORD your God and [^b]obey Him with all your heart and soul in accordance with everything that I am commanding you today, you and your sons, 







###### 3 



then the LORD your God will restore [^c]you from captivity, and have compassion on you, and will gather you again from all the peoples where the LORD your God has scattered you. 







###### 4 



If any of your scattered _countrymen_ are at the [^d]ends of the earth, from there the LORD your God will gather you, and from there He will [^e]bring you back. 







###### 5 



The LORD your God will bring you into the land which your fathers possessed, and you shall possess it; and He will be good to you and make you more numerous than your fathers. 







###### 6 



"Moreover, the LORD your God will circumcise your heart and the hearts of your [^f]descendants, to love the LORD your God with all your heart and all your soul, so that you may live. 







###### 7 



And the LORD your God will [^g]inflict all these curses on your enemies and on those who hate you, who persecuted you. 







###### 8 



And you will again [^h]obey the LORD, and [^i]follow all His commandments which I am commanding you today. 







###### 9 



Then the LORD your God will prosper you [^j]abundantly in every work of your hand, in the [^k]children of your womb, the [^l]offspring of your cattle, and in the [^m]produce of your ground, for the LORD will again rejoice over you for good, just as He rejoiced over your fathers; 







###### 10 



[^n]if you [^o]obey the LORD your God, to keep His commandments and His statutes which are written in this Book of the Law, [^p]if you turn to the LORD your God with all your heart and soul. 







###### 11 



"For this commandment which I am commanding you today is not too difficult for you, nor is it far away. 







###### 12 



It is not in heaven, [^q]that you could say, 'Who will go up to heaven for us and get it for us, and proclaim it to us, so that we may [^r]follow it?' 







###### 13 



Nor is it beyond the sea, [^s]that you could say, 'Who will cross the sea for us and get it for us and proclaim it to us, so that we may [^t]follow it?' 







###### 14 



On the contrary, the word is very near you, in your mouth and in your heart, that you may [^u]follow it. ## Choose Life 







###### 15 



"See, I have placed before you today life and [^v]happiness, and death and [^w]adversity, 







###### 16 



in that I am commanding you today to love the LORD your God, to walk in His ways and to keep His commandments, His statutes, and His judgments, so that you may live and become numerous, and that the LORD your God may bless you in the land where you are entering to take possession of it. 







###### 17 



But if your heart turns away and you will not obey, but allow yourself to be led astray and you worship other gods and serve them, 







###### 18 



I declare to you today that you will certainly perish. You will not prolong _your_ days in the land where you are crossing the Jordan to enter [^x]and take possession of it. 







###### 19 



I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that I have placed before you life and death, the blessing and the curse. So choose life in order that you may live, you and your [^y]descendants, 







###### 20 



by loving the LORD your God, by obeying His voice, and by holding close to Him; for [^z]this is your life and the length of your days, [^aa]so that you may live in the land which the LORD swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give them." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

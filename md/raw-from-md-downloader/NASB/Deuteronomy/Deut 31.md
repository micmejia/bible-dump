# Deuteronomy 31

***








###### 1 



So Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel. 







###### 2 



And he said to them, "I am 120 years old today; I am no longer able to [^a]go out and come in, and the LORD has told me, 'You shall not cross this Jordan.' 







###### 3 



It is the LORD your God who is going to cross ahead of you; He Himself will destroy these nations before you, and you shall dispossess them. Joshua is the one who is going to cross ahead of you, just as the LORD has spoken. 







###### 4 



And the LORD will do to them just as He did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to their land, when He destroyed them. 







###### 5 



The LORD will turn them over to you, and you will do to them in accordance with all the commandments which I have commanded you. 







###### 6 



Be strong and courageous, do not be afraid or in dread of them, for the LORD your God is the One who is going with you. He will not desert you or abandon you." 







###### 7 



Then Moses called to Joshua and said to him in the sight of all Israel, "Be strong and courageous, for you will go with this people into the land which the LORD has sworn to their fathers to give them, and you will give it to them as an inheritance. 







###### 8 



And the LORD is the one who is going ahead of you; He will be with you. He will not desert you or abandon you. Do not fear and do not be dismayed." 







###### 9 



So Moses wrote this Law and gave it to the priests, the sons of Levi who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and to all the elders of Israel. 







###### 10 



Then Moses commanded them, saying, "At the end of _every_ seven years, at the time of the year of the release of debts, at the Feast of Booths, 







###### 11 



when all Israel comes to appear before the LORD your God at the place which He will choose, you shall read this Law before all Israel [^b]so that they hear _it_. 







###### 12 



Assemble the people, the men, the women, the children, and the stranger who is in your [^c]town, so that they may hear and learn and fear the LORD your God, and be careful to [^d]follow all the words of this Law. 







###### 13 



And their children, who have not known, will hear and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as you live on the land [^e]which you are about to cross the Jordan to [^f]possess." ## Israel Will Fall Away 







###### 14 



Then the LORD said to Moses, "Behold, [^g]the time for you to die is near; call Joshua and present yourselves at the tent of meeting, and I will commission him." So Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves at the tent of meeting. 







###### 15 



And the LORD appeared in the tent in a pillar of cloud, and the pillar of cloud stood at the entrance of the tent. 







###### 16 



The LORD said to Moses, "Behold, you are about to [^h]lie down with your fathers; and this people will arise and play the prostitute with the foreign gods of the land into the midst of which they are going, and they will abandon Me and break My covenant which I have made with them. 







###### 17 



Then My anger will be kindled against them on that day, and I will abandon them and hide My face from them, and they will be consumed, and many evils and troubles will find them; so they will say on that day, 'Is it not because our God is not among us that these evils have found us?' 







###### 18 



But I will assuredly hide My face on that day because of all the evil that they will have done, for they will have turned away to other gods. 







###### 19 



"Now then, write this song for yourselves, and teach it to the sons of Israel; put it [^i]on their lips, so that this song may be a witness for Me against the sons of Israel. 







###### 20 



For when I bring them into the land flowing with milk and honey, which I swore to their fathers, and they eat and are satisfied and become [^j]prosperous, then they will turn to other gods and serve them, and spurn Me and break My covenant. 







###### 21 



Then it will come about, when many evils and troubles find them, that this song will testify before them as a witness (for it shall not be forgotten from the mouth of their [^k]descendants); for I know their inclination which they are [^l]developing today, before I bring them into the land which I swore." 







###### 22 



So Moses wrote down this song on the same day, and taught it to the sons of Israel. ## Joshua Is Commissioned 







###### 23 



Then He commissioned Joshua the son of Nun, and said, "Be strong and courageous, for you will bring the sons of Israel into the land which I swore to them, and I will be with you." 







###### 24 



It came about, when Moses finished writing the words of this Law in a book until they were complete, 







###### 25 



that Moses commanded the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying, 







###### 26 



"Take this Book of the Law and place it beside the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, so that it may [^m]remain there as a witness against you. 







###### 27 



For I know your rebellion and your [^n]stubbornness; behold, as long as I have been alive with you _until_ today, you have been rebellious against the LORD; how much more, then, after my death? 







###### 28 



Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes and your officers, that I may speak these words in their hearing and call the heavens and the earth as witnesses against them. 







###### 29 



For I know that after my death you will behave very corruptly and turn from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will confront you in the latter days, because you will do that which is evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking Him to anger with the work of your hands." 







###### 30 



Then Moses spoke in the hearing of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song, until they were complete: ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

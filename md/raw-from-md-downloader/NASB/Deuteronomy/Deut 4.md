# Deuteronomy 4

***








###### 1 



"Now, Israel, listen to the statutes and the judgments which I am teaching you to perform, so that you will live and go in and take possession of the land which the LORD, the God of your fathers, is giving you. 







###### 2 



You shall not add to the word which I am commanding you, nor take away from it, so that you may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I am commanding you. 







###### 3 



Your eyes have seen what the LORD has done in the case of Baal-peor, for all the men who followed Baal-peor, the LORD your God has destroyed [^a]them from among you. 







###### 4 



But you who clung to the LORD your God are alive today, every one of you. 







###### 5 



"See, I have taught you statutes and judgments just as the LORD my God commanded me, that you are to do these things in the land where you are entering to take possession of it. 







###### 6 



So keep and do _them_, for that is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples who will hear all these statutes and say, 'Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.' 







###### 7 



For what great nation _is there_ that has a god so near to it as is the LORD our God whenever we call on Him? 







###### 8 



Or what great nation _is there_ that has statutes and judgments as righteous as this whole Law which I am setting before you today? 







###### 9 



"Only be careful for yourself and watch over your soul diligently, so that you do not forget the things which your eyes have seen and they do not depart from your heart all the days of your life; but make them known to your sons and your grandsons. 







###### 10 



_Remember_ the day you stood before the LORD your God at Horeb, when the LORD said to me, 'Assemble the people to Me, that I may have them hear My words so that they may learn to [^b]fear Me all the days that they live on the earth, and that they may teach their children.' 







###### 11 



You came forward and stood at the foot of the mountain, and the mountain was burning with fire to the heart of the heavens: darkness, cloud, and thick gloom. 







###### 12 



Then the LORD spoke to you from the midst of the fire; you heard the sound of words, but you saw no form--_there was_ only a voice. 







###### 13 



So He declared to you His covenant which He commanded you to perform, _that is_, the Ten [^c]Commandments; and He wrote them on two tablets of stone. 







###### 14 



The LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, so that you would perform them in the land where you are going over to take possession of it. 







###### 15 



"So be very careful [^d]yourselves, since you did not see any form on the day the LORD spoke to you at Horeb from the midst of the fire, 







###### 16 



so that you do not act corruptly and make a carved image for yourselves in the form of any figure, a representation of male or female, 







###### 17 



a representation of any animal that is on the earth, a representation of any winged bird that flies in the sky, 







###### 18 



a representation of anything that crawls on the ground, _or_ a representation of any fish that is in the water below the earth. 







###### 19 



And _be careful_ not to raise your eyes to heaven and look at the sun, the moon, and the stars, all the heavenly [^e]lights, and _allow yourself_ to be drawn away and worship them and serve them, _things_ which the LORD your God has allotted to all the peoples under the whole heaven. 







###### 20 



But the LORD has taken you and brought you out of the iron furnace, from Egypt, to be a people of His own possession, as today. 







###### 21 



"Now the LORD was angry with me on your account, and He swore that I would not cross the Jordan, and that I would not enter the good land which the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance. 







###### 22 



For I am going to die in this land; I am not crossing the Jordan, but you are going to cross, and you will take possession of this good land. 







###### 23 



So be careful [^f]yourselves, that you do not forget the covenant of the LORD your God which He made with you, and make for yourselves a carved image in the form of anything _against_ which the LORD your God has commanded you. 







###### 24 



For the LORD your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God. 







###### 25 



"When you father children and _have_ [^g]grandchildren, and you grow old in the land, and you act corruptly, and make [^h]an idol in the form of anything, and do what is evil in the sight of the LORD your God to provoke Him to anger, 







###### 26 



I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you today, that you will certainly perish quickly from the land where you are going over the Jordan to take possession of it. You will not [^i]live long on it, but will be utterly destroyed. 







###### 27 



The LORD will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be left few in number among the nations where the LORD drives you. 







###### 28 



There you will serve gods, the work of human hands, wood and stone, which neither see nor hear, nor eat nor smell _anything_. 







###### 29 



But from there you will seek the LORD your God, and you will find _Him_ if you search for Him with all your heart and all your soul. 







###### 30 



When you are in distress and all these things happen to you, in the latter days you will return to the LORD your God and listen to His voice. 







###### 31 



For the LORD your God is a compassionate God; He will not abandon you nor destroy you, nor forget the covenant with your fathers which He swore to them. 







###### 32 



"Indeed, ask now about the earlier days that were [^j]before your time, since the day that God created [^k]mankind on the earth, and _inquire_ from one end of the heavens to the other. Has _anything_ been done like this great thing, or has _anything_ been heard like it? 







###### 33 



Has _any_ people heard the voice of God speaking from the midst of the fire, as you have heard _it_, and survived? 







###### 34 



Or has a god ventured to go to take for himself a nation from within _another_ nation by trials, by signs and wonders, by war, by a mighty hand, by an outstretched arm, and by great terrors, [^l]just as the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes? 







###### 35 



You were shown _these things_ so that you might know that the LORD, He is God; there is no other besides Him. 







###### 36 



Out of the heavens He let you hear His voice to discipline you; and on earth He let you see His great fire, and you heard His words from the midst of the fire. 







###### 37 



Because He loved your fathers, He chose [^m]their descendants after them. And He [^n]personally brought you from Egypt by His great power, 







###### 38 



driving out from before you nations greater and mightier than you, to bring you in _and_ to give you their land as an inheritance, as _it is_ today. 







###### 39 



Therefore know today, and take it to your heart, that the LORD, He is God in heaven above and on the earth below; there is no other. 







###### 40 



So you shall keep His statutes and His commandments which I am [^o]giving you today, so that it may go well for you and for your children after you, and that you may [^p]live long on the land which the LORD your God is giving you for all time." 







###### 41 



Then Moses set apart three cities across the Jordan to the [^q]east, 







###### 42 



for [^r]one to flee there who unintentionally killed his neighbor, without having hatred for him in time past; and by fleeing to one of these cities he might live: 







###### 43 



Bezer in the wilderness on the plateau for the Reubenites, Ramoth in Gilead for the Gadites, and Golan in Bashan for the Manassites. 







###### 44 



Now this is the Law which Moses set before the sons of Israel; 







###### 45 



these are the testimonies and the statutes, and the ordinances which Moses spoke to the sons of Israel, when they came out of Egypt, 







###### 46 



across the Jordan, in the valley opposite Beth-peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites who lived in Heshbon, whom Moses and the sons of Israel [^s]defeated when they came out of Egypt. 







###### 47 



And they took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, who _were_ across the Jordan to the [^t]east, 







###### 48 



from Aroer, which is on the edge of the [^u]Valley of Arnon, even as far as Mount Sion (that is, Hermon), 







###### 49 



with all the Arabah across the Jordan to the east, even as far as the sea of the Arabah, [^v]at the foot of the slopes of Pisgah. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

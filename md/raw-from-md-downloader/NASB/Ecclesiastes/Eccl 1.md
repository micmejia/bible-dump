# Ecclesiastes 1

***








###### 1 



The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem. 







###### 2 



"Futility of futilities," says the Preacher, "Futility of futilities! All is futility." 







###### 3 



What advantage does a person have in all his work Which he does under the sun? 







###### 4 



A generation goes and a generation comes, But the earth [^a]remains forever. 







###### 5 



Also, the sun rises and the sun sets; And [^b]hurrying to its place it rises there _again_. 







###### 6 



[^c]Blowing toward the south, Then turning toward the north, The wind continues [^d]swirling along; And on its circular courses the wind returns. 







###### 7 



All the rivers [^e]flow into the sea, Yet the sea is not full. To the place where the rivers [^f]flow, There they [^g]flow again. 







###### 8 



All things are wearisome; No one can tell _it_. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, Nor is the ear filled with hearing. 







###### 9 



What has been, it is what will be, And what has been done, it is what will be done. So there is nothing new under the sun. 







###### 10 



Is there anything of which one might say, "See this, it is new"? It has already existed for ages Which were before us. 







###### 11 



There is no remembrance of the [^h]earlier things, And of the later things as well, which will occur, There will be no remembrance of them Among those who will come later _still_. ## The Futility of Wisdom 







###### 12 



I, the Preacher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem. 







###### 13 



And I set my [^i]mind to seek and explore by wisdom about everything that has been done under heaven. _It_ is a [^j]sorry task with which God has given the sons of mankind to be troubled. 







###### 14 



I have seen all the works which have been done under the sun, and behold, all is futility and striving after wind. 







###### 15 



What is crooked cannot be straightened, and what is lacking cannot be counted. 







###### 16 



I [^k]said to myself, "Behold, I have magnified and increased wisdom more than all who were over Jerusalem before me; and my [^l]mind has observed [^m]a wealth of wisdom and knowledge." 







###### 17 



And I applied my [^n]mind to know wisdom and to know insanity and foolishness; I realized that this also is striving after wind. 







###### 18 



Because in much wisdom there is much grief; and increasing knowledge _results in_ increasing pain. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

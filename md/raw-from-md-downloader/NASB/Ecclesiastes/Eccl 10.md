# Ecclesiastes 10

***








###### 1 



Dead flies turn a perfumer's oil rancid, _so_ a little foolishness is more [^a]potent than wisdom _and_ honor. 







###### 2 



A wise person's heart _directs him_ toward the right, but the foolish person's heart _directs him_ toward the left. 







###### 3 



Even when the fool walks along the road, his [^b]sense is lacking, and he [^c]demonstrates to everyone _that_ he is a fool. 







###### 4 



If the ruler's [^d]temper rises against you, do not abandon your place, because composure puts great offenses to rest. 







###### 5 



There is an evil I have seen under the sun, like a mistake that proceeds from the ruler: 







###### 6 



foolishness is set in many exalted places while the rich sit in humble places. 







###### 7 



I have seen slaves _riding_ on horses and princes walking like slaves on the land. 







###### 8 



One who digs a pit may fall into it, and a serpent may bite one who breaks through a wall. 







###### 9 



One who quarries stones may be hurt by them, and one who splits logs may be endangered by them. 







###### 10 



If the [^e]axe is dull and he does not sharpen _its_ [^f]edge, then he must exert _more_ strength. Wisdom _has_ the advantage of bringing success. 







###### 11 



If the serpent bites [^g]before being charmed, there is no benefit for the charmer. 







###### 12 



Words from the mouth of a wise person are gracious, while the lips of a fool consume him; 







###### 13 



the beginning of [^h]his talking is foolishness, and the end of [^i]it is evil insanity. 







###### 14 



Yet the fool multiplies words. No person knows what will happen, and who can tell him what will come after him? 







###### 15 



The labor of [^j]a fool makes him _so_ weary that he does not _even_ know how to go to a city. 







###### 16 



Woe to you, land whose king is a boy, and whose princes [^k]feast in the morning. 







###### 17 



Blessed are you, land whose king is of nobility, and whose princes eat at the appropriate time--for strength and not for drunkenness. 







###### 18 



Through extreme laziness the rafters sag, and through idleness the house leaks. 







###### 19 



_People_ prepare a meal for enjoyment, wine makes life joyful, and money [^l]is the answer to everything. 







###### 20 



Furthermore, in your bedroom do not curse a king, and in your sleeping rooms do not curse a rich person; for a bird of the sky will bring the sound, and the winged one will make _your_ word known. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

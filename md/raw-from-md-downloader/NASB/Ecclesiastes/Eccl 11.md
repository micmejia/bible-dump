# Ecclesiastes 11

***








###### 1 



Cast your bread on the surface of the waters, for you will find it [^a]after many days. 







###### 2 



Divide your portion to seven, or even to eight, for you do not know what misfortune may occur on the earth. 







###### 3 



If the clouds are full, they pour out rain on the earth; and whether a tree falls toward the south or toward the north, wherever the tree falls, there it [^b]lies. 







###### 4 



One who watches the wind will not sow and one who looks at the clouds will not harvest. 







###### 5 



Just as you do not know the path of the [^c]wind, and how bones _are formed_ in the womb of the [^d]pregnant woman, so you do not know the activity of God who makes everything. 







###### 6 



Sow your seed in the morning and do not [^e]be idle in the evening, for you do not know whether [^f]one or the other will succeed, or whether both of them alike will be good. 







###### 7 



The light is pleasant, and _it is_ good for the eyes to see the sun. 







###### 8 



Indeed, if a person lives many years, let him rejoice in them all; but let him remember the days of darkness, for they will be many. Everything that is to come _will be_ futility. 







###### 9 



Rejoice, young man, during your childhood, and let your heart be pleasant during the days of young manhood. And follow the [^g]impulses of your heart and the [^h]desires of your eyes. Yet know that God will bring you to judgment for all these things. 







###### 10 



So remove [^i]sorrow from your heart and keep [^j]pain away from your body, because childhood and the prime of life are [^k]fleeting. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

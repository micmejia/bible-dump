# Ecclesiastes 3

***








###### 1 



There is an appointed time for everything. And there is a time for every matter under heaven-- 







###### 2 



A time to give birth and a time to die; A time to plant and a time to uproot what is planted. 







###### 3 



A time to kill and a time to heal; A time to tear down and a time to build up. 







###### 4 



A time to weep and a time to laugh; A time to mourn and a time to dance. 







###### 5 



A time to throw stones and a time to gather stones; A time to embrace and a time to shun embracing. 







###### 6 



A time to search and a time to give up as lost; A time to keep and a time to throw away. 







###### 7 



A time to tear apart and a time to sew together; A time to be silent and a time to speak. 







###### 8 



A time to love and a time to hate; A time for war and a time for peace. 







###### 9 



What benefit _is there for_ the worker _from that_ in which he labors? 







###### 10 



I have seen the task which God has given the sons of mankind with which to [^a]occupy themselves. ## God Set Eternity in the Heart of Mankind 







###### 11 



He has made everything appropriate in its time. He has also set eternity in their heart, without _the possibility that_ mankind will find out the work which God has done from the beginning even to the end. 







###### 12 



I know that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice and to do good in one's lifetime; 







###### 13 



moreover, that every person who eats and drinks sees good in all his labor--this is the gift of God. 







###### 14 



I know that everything God does will remain forever; there is nothing to add to it and there is nothing to take from it. And God has _so_ worked, that _people_ will [^b]fear Him. 







###### 15 



That _which is_, is what has already been, and that which will be has already been; and God [^c]seeks what has passed by. 







###### 16 



Furthermore, I have seen under the sun _that_ in the place of justice there is wickedness and in the place of righteousness there is wickedness. 







###### 17 



I said [^d]to myself, "God will judge the righteous and the wicked," for a time for every matter and for every deed [^e]is there. 







###### 18 



I said [^f]to myself regarding the sons of mankind, "God is testing them in order for them to see that they are _as_ animals, they to themselves." 







###### 19 



For the fate of the sons of mankind and the fate of animals [^g]is the same. As one dies, so dies the other; indeed, they all have the same breath, and there is no advantage for mankind over animals, for all is futility. 







###### 20 



All go to the same place. All came from the dust and all return to the dust. 







###### 21 



Who knows that the spirit of the sons of mankind ascends upward and the spirit of the animal descends downward to the earth? 







###### 22 



I have seen that nothing is better than when a person is happy in his activities, for that is his [^h]lot. For who will bring him to see what will occur after him? ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

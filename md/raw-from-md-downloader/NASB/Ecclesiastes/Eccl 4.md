# Ecclesiastes 4

***








###### 1 



Then I looked again at all the acts of oppression which were being done under the sun. And behold, _I saw_ the tears of the oppressed and _that_ they had no one to comfort _them_; and power was on the side of their oppressors, but they had no one to comfort _them_. 







###### 2 



So I congratulated the dead who are already dead, more than the living who are still living. 







###### 3 



But better _off_ than both of them is the one who has never existed, who has never seen the evil activity that is done under the sun. 







###### 4 



I have seen that every labor and every skill which is done is _the result of_ rivalry between a person and his neighbor. This too is futility and striving after wind. 







###### 5 



The fool folds his hands and consumes his own flesh. 







###### 6 



One hand full of rest is better than two fists full of labor and striving after wind. 







###### 7 



Then I looked again at futility under the sun. 







###### 8 



There was a man without a [^a]dependent, having neither a son nor a brother, yet there was no end to all his labor. Indeed, his eyes were not satisfied with riches, _and he never asked_, "And for whom do I labor and deprive myself of pleasure?" This too is futility, and it is an unhappy task. 







###### 9 



Two are better than one because they have a good return for their labor; 







###### 10 



for if [^b]either of them falls, the one will lift up his companion. But woe to the one who falls when there is not [^c]another to lift him up! 







###### 11 



Furthermore, if two lie down together they [^d]keep warm, but how can one be warm _alone_? 







###### 12 



And if [^e]one can overpower him who is alone, two can resist him. A cord of three _strands_ is not quickly torn apart. 







###### 13 



A poor yet wise youth is better than an old and foolish king who no longer knows _how_ to receive [^f]instruction-- 







###### 14 



for he has come out of prison to become king, even though he was born poor in his kingdom. 







###### 15 



I have seen all those living under the sun move to the side of the second youth who [^g]replaces him. 







###### 16 



There is no end to all the people, to all who were before them. Even the ones who will come later will not be happy with him; for this too is futility and striving after wind. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Ecclesiastes 5

***








###### 1 



[^a]Guard your steps as you go to the house of God, and approach to listen rather than to offer the sacrifice of fools; for they do not know that they are doing evil. 







###### 2 



[^b]Do not be quick with your mouth or [^c]impulsive in thought to bring up a matter in the presence of God. For God is in heaven and you are on the earth; therefore let your words be few. 







###### 3 



For the dream comes through much [^d]effort, and the voice of a fool through many words. 







###### 4 



When you make a vow to God, do not be late in paying it; for _He takes_ no delight in fools. Pay what you vow! 







###### 5 



It is better that you not vow, than vow and not pay. 







###### 6 



Do not let your [^e]speech cause [^f]you to sin, and do not say in the presence of the messenger _of God_ that it was a mistake. Why should God be angry on account of your voice, and destroy the work of your hands? 







###### 7 



For in many dreams and in many words there is futility. Rather, [^g]fear God. 







###### 8 



If you see oppression of the poor and denial of justice and righteousness in the province, do not be shocked at the [^h]sight; for one [^i]official watches over another [^j]official, and there are higher [^k]officials over them. 







###### 9 



After all, a king who cultivates the field is beneficial to the land. ## The Foolishness of Riches 







###### 10 



One who loves money will not be satisfied with money, nor one who loves abundance _with its_ income. This too is futility. 







###### 11 



When good things increase, those who consume them increase. So what is the advantage to their owners except to [^l]look _at them_? 







###### 12 



The sleep of the laborer is sweet, whether he eats little or much; but the [^m]full stomach of the rich person does not allow him to sleep. 







###### 13 



There is a sickening evil _which_ I have seen under the sun: wealth being [^n]hoarded by its owner to his detriment. 







###### 14 



When that wealth was lost through bad business and he had fathered a son, then there was nothing [^o]to support him. 







###### 15 



As he came naked from his mother's womb, so he will return as he came. He will take nothing from the fruit of his labor that he can carry in his hand. 







###### 16 



This also is a sickening evil: exactly as a person [^p]is born, so will he [^q]die. What then is the advantage for him who labors for the wind? 







###### 17 



All his life _he_ also eats in darkness with great irritation, sickness, and anger. 







###### 18 



Here is what I have seen to be good and [^r]fitting: to eat, to drink, and [^s]enjoy oneself in all one's labor in which he labors under the sun _during_ the few [^t]years of his life which God has given him; for this is his [^u]reward. 







###### 19 



Furthermore, as for every person to whom God has given riches and wealth, He has also given him the opportunity to [^v]enjoy them and to receive his [^w]reward and rejoice in his labor; this is the gift of God. 







###### 20 



For he will not often call to mind the [^x]years of his life, because God keeps [^y]him busy with the joy of his heart. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Ecclesiastes 6

***








###### 1 



There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is widespread [^a]among mankind: 







###### 2 



a person to whom God has given riches, wealth, and honor, so that his soul lacks nothing of all that he desires, yet God has not given him the opportunity to [^b]enjoy these things, but a foreigner [^c]enjoys them. This is futility and a severe affliction. 







###### 3 



If a man fathers a hundred _children_ and lives many years, however many [^d]they may be, but his soul is not satisfied with good things and he does not even have a _proper_ burial, _then_ I say, "Better the miscarriage than he, 







###### 4 



for _a miscarriage_ comes in futility and goes into darkness; and its name is covered in darkness. 







###### 5 



It has not even seen the sun nor does it know _it; yet_ [^e]it is better off than that _man_. 







###### 6 



Even if _the man_ lives a thousand years twice, but does not see good things--do not all go to one _and the same_ place?" 







###### 7 



All a person's labor is for his mouth, and yet [^f]his appetite is not [^g]satisfied. 







###### 8 



For what advantage does the wise person have over the fool? What does the poor person have, knowing _how_ to walk before the living? 







###### 9 



What the eyes see is better than what the soul [^h]desires. This too is futility and striving after wind. 







###### 10 



Whatever exists has already been named, and it is known what man is; for he cannot dispute with the [^i]one who is mightier than he is. 







###### 11 



For there are many words which increase futility. What _then_ is the advantage to a person? 







###### 12 



For who knows what is good for a person during _his_ lifetime, _during_ the few [^j]years of his futile life? He will [^k]spend them like a shadow. For who can tell a person what will happen after him under the sun? ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

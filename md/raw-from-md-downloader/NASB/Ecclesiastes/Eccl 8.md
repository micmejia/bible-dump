# Ecclesiastes 8

***








###### 1 



Who is like the wise person and who knows the meaning of a matter? A person's wisdom illuminates his face and makes his stern face [^a]brighten up. 







###### 2 



I say, "Keep the [^b]command of the king because of the oath [^c]before God. 







###### 3 



Do not be in a hurry [^d]to leave him. Do not join in an evil matter, for he will do whatever he pleases." 







###### 4 



Since the word of the king is authoritative, who will say to him, "What are you doing?" 







###### 5 



One who keeps a _royal_ command experiences no [^e]trouble, for a wise heart knows the proper time and procedure. 







###### 6 



For there is a proper time and procedure for every delight, though a person's trouble is heavy upon him. 







###### 7 



If no one knows what will happen, who can tell him when it will happen? 







###### 8 



No one has authority over the wind to restrain the wind, nor authority over the day of death; and there is no _military_ discharge in the time of war, and evil will not save [^f]those who practice it. 







###### 9 



All this I have seen, and have applied my [^g]mind to every deed that has been done under the sun at a time when one person has exercised authority over _another_ person to his detriment. 







###### 10 



So then, I have seen the wicked buried, those who used to go in and out of the holy place, and they are _soon_ forgotten in the city where they did such things. This too is futility. 







###### 11 



Because the sentence against an evil deed is not executed quickly, therefore the hearts of the sons of mankind among them are [^h]fully given to do evil. 







###### 12 



Although a sinner does evil a hundred _times_ and may lengthen his _life_, still I know that it will go well for those who fear God, who fear [^i]Him openly. 







###### 13 



But it will not go well for the evil person and he will not lengthen his days like a shadow, because he does not fear God. 







###### 14 



There is futility which is done on the earth, that is, there are righteous people to whom it [^j]happens according to the deeds of the wicked. On the other hand, there are evil people to whom it [^k]happens according to the deeds of the righteous. I say that this too is futility. 







###### 15 



So I commended pleasure, for there is nothing good for a person under the sun except to eat, drink, and be joyful, and this will stand by him in his labor _throughout_ the days of his life which God has given him under the sun. 







###### 16 



When I devoted my [^l]mind to know wisdom and to see the business which has been done on the earth (even though one should [^m]never sleep day or night), 







###### 17 



and I saw every work of God, _I concluded_ that one cannot discover the work which has been done under the sun. Even though a person laboriously seeks, he will not discover; and even if the wise person claims to know, he cannot discover. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

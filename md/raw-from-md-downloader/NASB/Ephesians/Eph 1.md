# Ephesians 1

***








###### 1 



Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus [^a]by the will of God, To the [^b]saints who are [^c]at Ephesus and _are_ faithful in Christ Jesus: 







###### 2 



Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 







###### 3 



Blessed _be_ the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly _places_ in Christ, 







###### 4 



just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before [^d]Him. In love 







###### 5 



[^e]He predestined us to adoption as sons _and daughters_ through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will, 







###### 6 



to the praise of the glory of His grace, with which He favored us in the Beloved. 







###### 7 



In [^f]Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our wrongdoings, according to the riches of His grace 







###### 8 



which He [^g]lavished on [^h]us. In all wisdom and insight 







###### 9 



He [^i]made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He set forth in Him, 







###### 10 



regarding _His_ plan of the fullness of the times, to bring all things together in Christ, things [^j]in the heavens and things on the earth. 







###### 11 



[^k]In Him we also have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of Him who works all things in accordance with the plan of His will, 







###### 12 



to the end that [^l]we who were the first to hope in the [^m]Christ would be to the praise of His glory. 







###### 13 



In [^n]Him, [^o]you also, after listening to the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation--having also [^p]believed, you were sealed in [^q]Him with the Holy Spirit of the promise, 







###### 14 



who is a first installment of our inheritance, in regard to the redemption of _God's own_ possession, to the praise of His glory. 







###### 15 



For this reason I too, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which _exists_ among you and [^r]your love for all the [^s]saints, 







###### 16 



do not cease giving thanks for you, while making mention _of you_ in my prayers; 







###### 17 



that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the [^t]knowledge of Him. 







###### 18 



_I pray that_ the eyes of your heart [^u]may be enlightened, so that you will know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the [^v]saints, 







###### 19 



and what is the [^w]boundless greatness of His power toward us who believe. _These are_ in accordance with the working of the strength of His might 







###### 20 



which He brought about in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly _places_, 







###### 21 



far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come. 







###### 22 



And He put all things in subjection under His feet, and made Him head over all things to the church, 







###### 23 



which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

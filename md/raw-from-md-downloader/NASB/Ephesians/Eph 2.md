# Ephesians 2

***








###### 1 



And [^a]you [^b]were dead [^c]in your offenses and sins, 







###### 2 



in which you previously walked according to the [^d]course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the [^e]sons of disobedience. 







###### 3 



Among them [^f]we too all previously lived in the lusts of our flesh, [^g]indulging the desires of the flesh and of the [^h]mind, and were by nature children of wrath, just as the rest. 







###### 4 



But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, 







###### 5 



even when we were dead [^i]in our wrongdoings, made us alive together [^j]with Christ (by grace you have been saved), 







###### 6 



and raised us up with Him, and seated us with Him in the heavenly _places_ in Christ Jesus, 







###### 7 



so that in the ages to come He might show the [^k]boundless riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. 







###### 8 



For by grace you have been saved through faith; and [^l]this _is_ not of yourselves, _it is_ the gift of God; 







###### 9 



not a result of works, so that no one may boast. 







###### 10 



For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them. 







###### 11 



Therefore remember that previously you, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called "Uncircumcision" by the so-called "Circumcision" _which is_ performed in the flesh by human hands-- 







###### 12 



_remember_ that you were at that time separate from Christ, [^m]excluded from [^n]the people of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in the world. 







###### 13 



But now in Christ Jesus you who previously were far away [^o]have been brought near [^p]by the blood of Christ. 







###### 14 



For He Himself is our peace, who made both _groups into_ one and broke down the [^q]barrier of the dividing wall, 







###### 15 



[^r]by abolishing [^s]in His flesh the hostility, _which is_ the Law _composed_ of commandments _expressed_ in ordinances, so that in Himself He might [^t]make the two one new person, _in this way_ establishing peace; 







###### 16 



and that He might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, [^u]by it having put to death the hostility. 







###### 17 



And He came and preached peace to you who were far away, and peace to those who were near; 







###### 18 



for through Him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father. 







###### 19 



So then you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but you are fellow citizens with the [^v]saints, and are of God's household, 







###### 20 



having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone, 







###### 21 



in whom the whole building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy [^w]temple in the Lord, 







###### 22 



in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling of God in the Spirit. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

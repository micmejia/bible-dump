# Ephesians 3

***








###### 1 



For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles-- 







###### 2 



if indeed you have heard of the administration of God's grace which was given to me for you; 







###### 3 



that by revelation there was made known to me the mystery, as I wrote before briefly. 







###### 4 



[^a]By referring to this, when you read you can understand my insight [^b]into the mystery of Christ, 







###### 5 



which in other generations was not made known to [^c]mankind, as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets [^d]in the Spirit; 







###### 6 



_to be specific_, that the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel, 







###### 7 



of which I was made a minister, according to the gift of God's grace which was given to me according to the working of His power. 







###### 8 



To me, the very least of all [^e]saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unfathomable riches of Christ, 







###### 9 



and to [^f]enlighten all people as to what the plan of the mystery is which for ages has been hidden in God, who created all things; 







###### 10 



so that the multifaceted wisdom of God might now be made known through the church to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly _places_. 







###### 11 



_This was_ in accordance with the [^g]eternal purpose which He [^h]carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord, 







###### 12 



in whom we have boldness and [^i]confident access through faith [^j]in Him. 







###### 13 



Therefore I ask [^k]you not to become discouraged about my tribulations in your behalf, [^l]since they are your glory. 







###### 14 



For this reason I bend my knees before the Father, 







###### 15 



from whom [^m]every family in heaven and on earth derives its name, 







###### 16 



that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inner [^n]self, 







###### 17 



so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; _and_ that you, being rooted and grounded in love, 







###### 18 



may be able to comprehend with all the [^o]saints what is the width and length and height and depth, 







###### 19 



and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled to all the fullness of God. 







###### 20 



Now to Him who is able to do far more abundantly beyond all that we ask or think, according to the power that works within us, 







###### 21 



to Him _be_ the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations [^p]forever and ever. Amen. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Ephesians 4

***








###### 1 



Therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord, urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called, 







###### 2 



with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love, 







###### 3 



being diligent to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. 







###### 4 



_There is_ one body and one Spirit, just as you also were called in one hope of your calling; 







###### 5 



one Lord, one faith, one baptism, 







###### 6 



one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all. 







###### 7 



But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of Christ's gift. 







###### 8 



Therefore [^a]it says, "When He ascended on high, He led captive _the_ captives, And He gave gifts to people." 







###### 9 



(Now this _expression_, "He ascended," what [^b]does it mean except that He also [^c]had descended into the lower parts of the earth? 







###### 10 



He who descended is Himself also He who ascended far above all the heavens, so that He might fill all things.) 







###### 11 



And He gave some _as_ apostles, some _as_ prophets, some _as_ evangelists, some _as_ [^d]pastors and teachers, 







###### 12 



for the equipping of the [^e]saints for the work of ministry, for the building up of the body of Christ; 







###### 13 



until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the [^f]knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature [^g]which belongs to the fullness of Christ. 







###### 14 



[^h]As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of people, by craftiness [^i]in deceitful scheming; 







###### 15 



but [^j]speaking the truth in love, [^k]we are to grow up in all _aspects_ into Him who is the head, _that is_, Christ, 







###### 16 



from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together [^l]by what every joint supplies, according to the [^m]proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love. ## The Christian's Walk 







###### 17 



So I say this, and affirm in the Lord, that you are to no longer walk just as the [^n]Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their minds, 







###### 18 



being darkened in their understanding, [^o]excluded from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart; 







###### 19 



and they, having become callous, have given themselves up to indecent behavior [^p]for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness. 







###### 20 



But you did not learn Christ in this way, 







###### 21 



if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him, just as truth is in Jesus, 







###### 22 



that, in reference to your former way of life, you are to rid yourselves of the old [^q]self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit, 







###### 23 



and that you are to be renewed in the spirit of your minds, 







###### 24 



and to put on the new [^r]self, which [^s]in _the likeness of_ God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth. 







###### 25 



Therefore, ridding yourselves of falsehood, speak truth each one _of you_ with his neighbor, because we are parts of one another. 







###### 26 



Be angry, and _yet_ do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, 







###### 27 



and do not give the devil [^t]an opportunity. 







###### 28 



The one who steals must no longer steal; but rather he must labor, producing with his own hands what is good, so that he will have _something_ to share with the one who has need. 







###### 29 



Let no [^u]unwholesome word come out of your mouth, but if _there is_ any good _word_ for edification [^v]according to the need _of the moment, say that_, so that it will give grace to those who hear. 







###### 30 



Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, [^w]by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. 







###### 31 



All bitterness, wrath, anger, [^x]clamor, and slander must be removed from you, along with all malice. 







###### 32 



Be kind to one another, compassionate, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven [^y]you. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

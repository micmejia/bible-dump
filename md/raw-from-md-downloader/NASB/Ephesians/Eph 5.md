# Ephesians 5

***








###### 1 



Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children; 







###### 2 



and walk in love, just as Christ also loved [^a]you and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God [^b]as a fragrant aroma. 







###### 3 



But sexual immorality [^c]or any impurity or greed must not even be mentioned among you, as is proper among [^d]saints; 







###### 4 



and _there must be no_ filthiness [^e]or foolish talk, or vulgar joking, which are not fitting, but rather giving of thanks. 







###### 5 



For this you know with certainty, that no sexually immoral or [^f]impure or greedy person, which [^g]amounts to an idolater, has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. 







###### 6 



_See that_ no one deceives you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the [^h]sons of disobedience. 







###### 7 



Therefore do not become partners with them; 







###### 8 



for you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord; walk as children of light 







###### 9 



(for the fruit of the light _consists_ in all goodness, righteousness, and truth), 







###### 10 



[^i]as you try to learn what is pleasing to the Lord. 







###### 11 



Do not participate in the useless deeds of darkness, but instead even expose them; 







###### 12 



for it is disgraceful even to speak of the things which are done by them in secret. 







###### 13 



But all things become visible when they are exposed by the light, for everything that becomes visible is light. 







###### 14 



For this reason [^j]it says, "Awake, sleeper, And arise from the dead, And Christ will shine on you." 







###### 15 



So then, [^k]be careful how you walk, not as unwise people but as wise, 







###### 16 



[^l]making the most of your time, because the days are evil. 







###### 17 



Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord _is_. 







###### 18 



And do not get drunk with wine, [^m]in which there is debauchery, but be filled with the Spirit, 







###### 19 



speaking to [^n]one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your hearts to the Lord; 







###### 20 



always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to _our_ God and Father; 







###### 21 



[^o]and subject yourselves to one another in the [^p]fear of Christ. ## Marriage like Christ and the Church 







###### 22 



Wives, _subject yourselves_ to your own husbands, as to the Lord. 







###### 23 



For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, He Himself _being_ the Savior of the body. 







###### 24 



But as the church is subject to Christ, so also the wives _ought to be_ to their husbands in everything. 







###### 25 



Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her, 







###### 26 



so that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, 







###### 27 



that He might present to Himself the church [^q]in all her glory, having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that she would be holy and blameless. 







###### 28 



So husbands also ought to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself; 







###### 29 



for no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also _does_ the church, 







###### 30 



because we are parts of His body. 







###### 31 



For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh. 







###### 32 



This mystery is great; but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church. 







###### 33 



Nevertheless, as for you individually, each _husband_ is to love his own wife the same as himself, and the wife _must see to it_ that she respects her husband. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

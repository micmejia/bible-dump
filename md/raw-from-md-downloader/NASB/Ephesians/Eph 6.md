# Ephesians 6

***








###### 1 



Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. 







###### 2 



Honor your father and mother (which is the first commandment with a promise), 







###### 3 



so that it may turn out well for you, and that you may live long on the earth. 







###### 4 



Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord. ## Slaves and Masters 







###### 5 



Slaves, be obedient to those who are your [^a]masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in the sincerity of your heart, as to Christ; 







###### 6 



not [^b]by way of [^c]eye-service, as people-pleasers, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the [^d]heart. 







###### 7 



With goodwill [^e]render service, as to the Lord, and not to people, 







###### 8 



knowing that whatever good thing each one does, he will receive this back from the Lord, whether slave or free. 







###### 9 



And masters, do the same things to them, and give up threatening, knowing that both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no partiality with Him. ## The Armor of God 







###### 10 



Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of His might. 







###### 11 



Put on the full armor of God, so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil. 







###### 12 



For our struggle is not against [^f]flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual _forces_ of wickedness in the heavenly _places_. 







###### 13 



Therefore, take up the full armor of God, so that you will be able to resist on the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm. 







###### 14 



Stand firm therefore, having belted your waist with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, 







###### 15 



and having strapped on your feet the preparation of the gospel of peace; 







###### 16 



[^g]in addition to all, taking up the shield of faith with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil _one_. 







###### 17 



And take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. 







###### 18 



[^h]With every prayer and request, [^i]pray at all times in the Spirit, and with this in view, [^j]be alert with all perseverance and _every_ request for all the [^k]saints, 







###### 19 



and _pray_ in my behalf, that speech may be given to me in the opening of my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel, 







###### 20 



for which I am an ambassador in [^l]chains; that [^m]in _proclaiming_ it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak. 







###### 21 



Now, so that you also may know about my circumstances _as to_ [^n]what I am doing, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful [^o]servant in the Lord, will make everything known to you. 







###### 22 



[^p]I have sent him to you for this very purpose, so that you may know [^q]about us, and that he may comfort your hearts. 







###### 23 



Peace be to the brothers _and sisters_, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 







###### 24 



Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ [^r]with incorruptible _love_. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

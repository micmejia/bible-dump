# Esther 3

***








###### 1 



After these events King Ahasuerus honored Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and promoted him and [^a]established his authority over all the officials who _were_ with him. 







###### 2 



All the king's servants who were at the king's gate bowed down and paid [^b]homage to Haman; for so the king had commanded regarding him. But Mordecai neither bowed down nor paid [^c]homage. 







###### 3 



Then the king's servants who were at the king's gate said to Mordecai, "Why are you violating the king's command?" 







###### 4 



Now it was when they had spoken daily to him and he would not listen to them, that they told Haman to see whether Mordecai's reason would [^d]stand; for he had told them that he was a Jew. 







###### 5 



When Haman saw that Mordecai neither bowed down nor paid [^e]homage to him, Haman was filled with rage. 







###### 6 



But he [^f]considered it beneath his dignity to [^g]kill Mordecai alone, for they had told him _who_ the people of Mordecai _were_; so Haman sought to annihilate all the Jews, the people of Mordecai, who _were found_ throughout the kingdom of Ahasuerus. 







###### 7 



In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, [^h]Pur, that is the lot, was cast before Haman from day to day and from month _to month_, [^i]until the twelfth month, that is the month Adar. 







###### 8 



Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus, "There is a certain people scattered and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom; their laws are different from _those_ of all _other_ people and they do not [^j]comply with the king's laws, so it is not in the king's interest to let them remain. 







###### 9 



If it is pleasing to the king, let it be [^k]decreed that they be eliminated, and I will pay [^l]ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who carry out the _king's_ business, to put into the king's treasuries." 







###### 10 



Then the king took his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews. 







###### 11 



And the king said to Haman, "The silver is [^m]yours, and the people _also_, to do with them as you please." 







###### 12 



Then the king's scribes were summoned on the thirteenth day of the first month, and it was written just as Haman commanded to the king's satraps, to the governors who were over each province and to the officials of each people, each province according to its script, each people according to its language, being written in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed with the king's signet ring. 







###### 13 



Letters were sent by couriers to all the king's provinces to annihilate, kill, and destroy all the Jews, both young and old, women and children, in one day, the thirteenth _day_ of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to seize their possessions as plunder. 







###### 14 



A copy of the edict to be [^n]issued as law in every province was published to all the peoples so that they would be ready for this day. 







###### 15 



The couriers went out, speeded by the king's [^o]order while the decree was [^p]issued at the citadel in Susa; and while the king and Haman sat down to drink, the city of Susa was agitated. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

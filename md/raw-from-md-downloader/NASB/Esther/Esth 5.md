# Esther 5

***








###### 1 



Now it came about on the third day that Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner courtyard of the king's palace in front of the king's [^a]rooms, and the king was sitting on his royal throne in the [^b]throne room, opposite the entrance to the palace. 







###### 2 



When the king saw Esther the queen standing in the courtyard, she obtained favor in his sight; and the king extended to Esther the golden scepter which _was_ in his hand. So Esther approached and touched the top of the scepter. 







###### 3 



Then the king said to her, "What is _troubling_ you, Queen Esther? And what is your request? Up to half of the kingdom it shall be given to you." 







###### 4 



Esther said, "If it pleases the king, may the king and Haman come this day to the banquet that I have prepared for him." 







###### 5 



Then the king said, "Bring Haman quickly so that we may do [^c]as Esther desires." So the king and Haman came to the banquet which Esther had prepared. 







###### 6 



[^d]As they drank their wine at the banquet, the king said to Esther, "What is your request, for it shall be granted to you. And what is your wish? Up to half of the kingdom it shall be done." 







###### 7 



So Esther replied, "My request and my wish is: 







###### 8 



if I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it pleases the king to grant my request and do [^e]what I wish, may the king and Haman come to the banquet which I will prepare for them, and tomorrow I will do [^f]as the king says." ## Haman's Pride 







###### 9 



Then Haman went out that day joyful and pleased of heart; but when Haman saw Mordecai at the king's gate and that he did not stand up or tremble before him, Haman was filled with anger against Mordecai. 







###### 10 



Haman controlled himself, however, and went to his house. But he [^g]sent for his friends and his wife Zeresh. 







###### 11 



Then Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and his many sons, and every _occasion on_ which the king had honored him and how he had [^h]promoted him above the officials and servants of the king. 







###### 12 



Haman also said, "Even Esther the queen let no one except me come with the king to the banquet which she had prepared; and tomorrow also I am invited by her with the king. 







###### 13 



Yet all of this [^i]does not satisfy me every time I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate." 







###### 14 



Then Zeresh his wife and all his friends said to him, "Have a wooden _gallows_ [^j]fifty cubits high made, and in the morning ask the king to have Mordecai hanged on it; then go joyfully with the king to the banquet." And the [^k]advice pleased Haman, so he had the wooden _gallows_ made. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

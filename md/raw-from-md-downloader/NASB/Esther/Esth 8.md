# Esther 8

***








###### 1 



On that day King Ahasuerus gave the house of Haman, the enemy of the Jews, to Queen Esther; and Mordecai came before the king, because Esther had disclosed what he was to her. 







###### 2 



Then the king took off his signet ring, which he had taken away from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman. 







###### 3 



Then Esther spoke again [^a]to the king, fell at his feet, wept, and pleaded for his compassion to avert the evil _scheme_ of Haman the Agagite and his plot which he had devised against the Jews. 







###### 4 



And the king extended the golden scepter to Esther. So Esther got up and stood before the king. 







###### 5 



Then she said, "If it pleases the king and if I have found favor before him, and the matter _seems_ proper to the king and I am pleasing in his sight, let it be written to revoke the letters devised by Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to eliminate the Jews who are in all the king's provinces. 







###### 6 



For how can I endure to see the disaster which will happen to my people, and how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?" 







###### 7 



So King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, "Behold, I have given the house of Haman to Esther, and they have hanged him on the wooden _gallows_ because he had reached out with his hand against the Jews. ## The King's Decree Avenges the Jews 







###### 8 



Now you write to the Jews [^b]as you see fit, in the king's name, and seal _it_ with the king's signet ring; for a decree which is written in the name of the king and sealed with the king's signet ring may not be revoked." 







###### 9 



So the king's scribes were summoned at that time in the third month (that is, the month Sivan), on the twenty-third [^c]day; and it was written in accordance with everything that Mordecai commanded the Jews, the satraps, the governors, and the officials of the provinces which _extended_ from India to [^d]Cush, 127 provinces, to every province according to its script, and to every people according to their language, as well as to the Jews according to their script and their language. 







###### 10 



He wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus, and sealed it with the king's signet ring, and sent letters by couriers on horses, riding on royal relay horses, offspring of racing mares. 







###### 11 



[^e]In the letters the king granted the Jews who were in each and every city _the right_ to assemble and to defend their lives, to destroy, kill, and eliminate the entire army of _any_ people or province which was going to attack them, _including_ children and women, and to plunder their spoils, 







###### 12 



on one day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, on the thirteenth _day_ of the twelfth month (that is, the month Adar). 







###### 13 



A copy of the edict to be [^f]issued as law in each and every province was published to all the peoples, so that the Jews would be ready for this day to avenge themselves on their enemies. 







###### 14 



The couriers, hurrying and speeded by the king's command, left, riding on the royal relay horses; and the decree was issued at the citadel in Susa. 







###### 15 



Then Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in a royal robe of violet and white, with a large crown of gold and a garment of fine linen and purple; and the city of Susa shouted and rejoiced. 







###### 16 



For the Jews there was light, joy, jubilation, and honor. 







###### 17 



In each and every province and in each and every city, wherever the king's commandment and his decree arrived, there was joy and jubilation for the Jews, a feast and a [^g]holiday. And many among the peoples of the land [^h]became Jews, because the dread of the Jews had fallen on them. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

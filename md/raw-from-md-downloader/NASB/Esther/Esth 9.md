# Esther 9

***








###### 1 



Now in the twelfth month (that is, the month Adar), on the thirteenth [^a]day, when the king's command and edict were to be put into effect, on the day when the enemies of the Jews hoped to gain the mastery over them, it turned out to the contrary so that the Jews themselves gained mastery over those who hated them. 







###### 2 



The Jews assembled in their cities throughout the provinces of King Ahasuerus to [^b]attack those who sought [^c]to harm them; and no one could stand against them, because the dread of them had fallen on all the peoples. 







###### 3 



Even all the officials of the provinces, the satraps, the governors, and those who were doing the king's business were supporting the Jews, because the dread of Mordecai had fallen on them. 







###### 4 



For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and the news about him spread throughout the provinces; for the man Mordecai became greater and greater. 







###### 5 



So the Jews struck all their enemies with [^d]the sword, killing and destroying; and they did as they pleased to those who hated them. 







###### 6 



At the citadel in Susa the Jews killed and eliminated five hundred men, 







###### 7 



and they killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, 







###### 8 



Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, 







###### 9 



Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha, 







###### 10 



the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Jews' enemy; but they did not lay their hands on the plunder. 







###### 11 



On that day the number of those who were killed at the citadel in Susa [^e]was reported to the king. 







###### 12 



And the king said to Queen Esther, "The Jews have killed and eliminated five hundred men and the ten sons of Haman at the citadel in Susa. What have they done in the rest of the king's provinces! Now what is your request? It shall also be granted you. And what is your further wish? It shall also be done." 







###### 13 



Then Esther said, "If it pleases the king, let tomorrow also be granted to the Jews who are in Susa to do according to the edict of today; and let Haman's ten sons be hanged on the wooden _gallows_." 







###### 14 



So the king commanded that it was to be done so; and an edict was issued in Susa, and Haman's ten sons were hanged. 







###### 15 



The Jews who were in Susa assembled also on the fourteenth day of the month Adar and killed three hundred men in Susa, but they did not lay their hands on the plunder. 







###### 16 



Now the rest of the Jews who _were_ in the king's provinces assembled, to defend their lives and [^f]rid themselves of their enemies, and to kill seventy-five thousand of those who hated them; but they did not lay their hands on the plunder. 







###### 17 



_This was done_ on the thirteenth day of the month Adar, and on the fourteenth [^g]day they rested and made it a day of feasting and rejoicing. 







###### 18 



But the Jews who were in Susa assembled on the thirteenth and the fourteenth [^h]of the same month, and they rested on the fifteenth [^i]day and made it a day of feasting and rejoicing. 







###### 19 



Therefore the Jews of the rural areas, who live in the rural towns, make the fourteenth day of the month Adar _a_ [^j]holiday for rejoicing and feasting and sending portions _of food_ to one another. ## The Feast of Purim Instituted 







###### 20 



Then Mordecai recorded these events, and he sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, _both_ near and far, 







###### 21 



obliging them to celebrate the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day [^k]of the same month, annually, 







###### 22 



because on those days the Jews [^l]rid themselves of their enemies, and _it was a_ month which was turned for them from grief into joy, and from mourning into a [^m]holiday; that they were to make them days of feasting and rejoicing, and sending portions _of food_ to one another, and gifts to the poor. 







###### 23 



So the Jews undertook what they had started to do, and what Mordecai had written to them. 







###### 24 



For Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the adversary of all the Jews, had schemed against the Jews to eliminate them, and had cast Pur, that is the lot, to disturb them and eliminate them. 







###### 25 



But when it came [^n]to the king's attention, he commanded by letter that his wicked scheme which he had devised against the Jews was to return on his own head, and that he and his sons were to be hanged on the wooden _gallows_. 







###### 26 



Therefore they called these days Purim after the name of [^o]Pur. [^p]And because of the instructions in this letter, both what they had seen in this regard and what had happened to them, 







###### 27 



the Jews established and [^q]made a custom for themselves, their [^r]descendants, and for all those who allied themselves with them, so that [^s]they would not fail to celebrate these two days according to their [^t]regulation and according to their appointed time annually. 







###### 28 



So these days were to be remembered and celebrated throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and these days of Purim were not to [^u]be neglected by the Jews, or their memory [^v]fade from their [^w]descendants. 







###### 29 



Then Queen Esther, daughter of Abihail, with Mordecai the Jew, wrote with full authority to confirm this second letter about Purim. 







###### 30 



He sent letters to all the Jews, to the 127 provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, _namely_, words of peace and truth, 







###### 31 



to establish these days of Purim at their appointed times, just as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had established for them, and just as they had established for themselves and for their [^x]descendants, _with_ [^y]instructions for their times of fasting and their mourning. 







###### 32 



The command of Esther established these [^z]customs for Purim, and it was written in the book. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

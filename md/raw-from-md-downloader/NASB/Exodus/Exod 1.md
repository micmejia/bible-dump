# Exodus 1

***








###### 1 



Now these are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt with Jacob; they came, each one [^a]with his household: 







###### 2 



Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah; 







###### 3 



Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin; 







###### 4 



Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher. 







###### 5 



[^b]All the people who descended from Jacob were seventy [^c]people, but Joseph was _already_ in Egypt. 







###### 6 



And Joseph died, and all his brothers and all that generation. 







###### 7 



But the sons of Israel were fruitful and [^d]increased greatly, and multiplied, and became exceedingly [^e]mighty, so that the land was filled with them. 







###### 8 



Now a new king arose over Egypt, who did not know Joseph. 







###### 9 



And he said to his people, "Behold, the people of the sons of Israel are [^f]too many and too mighty for us. 







###### 10 



Come, let us deal [^g]shrewdly with them, otherwise they will multiply, and [^h]in the event of war, they will also join those who hate us, and fight against us and [^i]depart from the land." 







###### 11 



So they appointed taskmasters over them to oppress them with [^j]hard labor. And they built for Pharaoh storage cities, Pithom and Raamses. 







###### 12 



But the more they oppressed them, the more they multiplied and the more they [^k]spread out, so that they dreaded the sons of Israel. 







###### 13 



The Egyptians [^l]used violence to compel the sons of Israel to labor; 







###### 14 



and they made their lives bitter with hard labor in mortar and bricks and at all _kinds of_ labor in the field, all their labors which they violently had them perform as slaves. 







###### 15 



Then the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom [^m]was named Shiphrah, and the other [^n]was named Puah; 







###### 16 



and he said, "When you are helping the Hebrew women to give birth and see _them_ upon the birthstool, if it is a son, then you shall put him to death; but if it is a daughter, then she shall live." 







###### 17 



But the midwives [^o]feared God, and did not do as the king of Egypt had [^p]commanded them, but let the boys live. 







###### 18 



So the king of Egypt called for the midwives and said to them, "Why have you done this thing, and let the boys live?" 







###### 19 



The midwives said to Pharaoh, "Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women; for they are vigorous and give birth before the midwife [^q]can get to them." 







###### 20 



So God was good to the midwives, and the people multiplied, and became very [^r]mighty. 







###### 21 



And because the midwives [^s]feared God, He [^t]established [^u]households for them. 







###### 22 



Then Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, "Every son who is born, [^v]you are to throw into the Nile, but every daughter, you are to keep alive." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

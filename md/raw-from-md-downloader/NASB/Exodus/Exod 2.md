# Exodus 2

***








###### 1 



Now a man from the house of Levi went and [^a]married a daughter of Levi. 







###### 2 



And the woman conceived and gave birth to a son; and when she saw [^b]that he was [^c]beautiful, she hid him for three months. 







###### 3 



But when she could no longer hide him, she got him a papyrus [^d]basket and covered it with tar and pitch. Then she put the child in it and set _it_ among the reeds by the bank of the Nile. 







###### 4 



And his sister stood at a distance to [^e]find out what would [^f]happen to him. 







###### 5 



Now the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the Nile, with her female attendants walking alongside the Nile; and she saw the [^g]basket among the reeds and sent her slave woman, and she brought it _to her_. 







###### 6 



When she opened _it_, she [^h]saw the child, and behold, _the_ boy was crying. And she had pity on him and said, "This is one of the Hebrews' children." 







###### 7 



Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, "Shall I go and call a woman for you who is nursing from the Hebrew women, so that she may nurse the child for you?" 







###### 8 



Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Go _ahead_." So the girl went and called the child's mother. 







###### 9 



Then Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Take this child away and nurse him for me, and I will give _you_ your wages." So the woman took the child and nursed him. 







###### 10 



And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter and he became her son. And she named him [^i]Moses, and said, "Because I drew him out of the water." 







###### 11 



Now it came about in those days, when Moses had grown up, that he went out to his [^j]fellow Hebrews and looked at their [^k]hard labors; and he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his [^l]fellow Hebrews. 







###### 12 



So he [^m]looked this way and that, and when he saw that there was no one _around_, he struck and killed the Egyptian, and hid [^n]his body in the sand. 







###### 13 



Now he went out the next day, and behold, two Hebrews were [^o]fighting with each other; and he said to the [^p]offender, "Why are you striking your companion?" 







###### 14 



But he said, "Who made you a [^q]ruler and a judge over us? Do you [^r]intend to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?" Then Moses was afraid and said, "Surely the matter has become known!" ## Moses Escapes to Midian 







###### 15 



When Pharaoh heard about this matter, he tried to kill Moses. But Moses fled from the presence of Pharaoh and [^s]settled in the land of Midian, and he sat down by a well. 







###### 16 



Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters; and they came to draw water and filled the troughs to water their father's flock. 







###### 17 



Then the shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses stood up and helped them and watered their flock. 







###### 18 



When they came to their father Reuel, he said, "Why have you come _back_ so soon today?" 







###### 19 



They said, "An Egyptian saved us from [^t]the shepherds, and what is more, he even drew water for us and watered the flock." 







###### 20 



So he said to his daughters, "Where is he then? Why is it that you have left the man behind? Invite him [^u]to have something to eat." 







###### 21 



And Moses was willing to live with the man. And he gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses. 







###### 22 



Then she gave birth to a son, and he named him [^v]Gershom, for he said, "I have been a stranger in a foreign land." 







###### 23 



Now it came about in _the course of_ those many days that the king of Egypt died. And the sons of Israel groaned because of the bondage, and they cried out; and their cry for help because of _their_ bondage ascended to God. 







###### 24 



So God heard their groaning; and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 







###### 25 



And God saw the sons of Israel, and God [^w]took notice _of them_. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Exodus 20

***








###### 1 



Then God spoke all these words, saying, 







###### 2 



"I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of [^a]slavery. 







###### 3 



"You shall have no other gods [^b]before Me. 







###### 4 



"You shall not make for yourself [^c]an idol, or any likeness of what is in heaven above or on the earth beneath, or in the water under the earth. 







###### 5 



You shall not worship them nor serve them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, inflicting the [^d]punishment of the fathers on the children, on the third and the fourth generations of those who hate Me, 







###### 6 



but showing [^e]favor to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments. 







###### 7 



"You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not [^f]leave him unpunished who takes His name in vain. 







###### 8 



"Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. 







###### 9 



For six days you shall labor and do all your work, 







###### 10 



but the seventh day is a Sabbath of the LORD your God; _on it_ you shall not do any work, you, or your son, or your daughter, your male slave or your female slave, or your cattle, or your [^g]resident who [^h]stays with you. 







###### 11 



For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea and everything that is in them, and He rested on the seventh day; for that reason the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy. 







###### 12 



"Honor your father and your mother, so that your days may be prolonged on the land which the LORD your God gives you. 







###### 13 



"You shall not murder. 







###### 14 



"You shall not commit adultery. 







###### 15 



"You shall not steal. 







###### 16 



"You shall not [^i]give false testimony against your neighbor. 







###### 17 



"You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his male slave, or his female slave, or his ox, or his donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor." 







###### 18 



And all the people were watching _and hearing_ the [^j]thunder and the lightning flashes, and the sound of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking; and when the people saw _it all_, they trembled and stood at a distance. 







###### 19 



Then they said to Moses, "Speak [^k]to us yourself and we will listen; but do not have God speak [^l]to us, or we will die!" 







###### 20 



However, Moses said to the people, "Do not be afraid; for God has come in order to test you, and in order that the fear of Him may [^m]remain with you, so that you will not sin." 







###### 21 



So the people stood at a distance, while Moses approached the thick darkness where God _was_. 







###### 22 



Then the LORD said to Moses, "This is what you shall say to the sons of Israel: 'You yourselves have seen that I have spoken [^n]to you from heaven. 







###### 23 



You shall not make _other gods_ besides Me; gods of silver or gods of gold, you shall not make for yourselves. 







###### 24 



You shall make an altar of earth for Me, and you shall sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, your sheep and your oxen; in every place where I cause My name to be remembered, I will come to you and bless you. 







###### 25 



And if you make an altar of stone for Me, you shall not build it of cut stones, for if you wield your chisel on it, you will profane it. 







###### 26 



And you shall not go up by steps to My altar, so that your nakedness will not be exposed on it.' ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

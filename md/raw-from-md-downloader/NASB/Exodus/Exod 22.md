# Exodus 22

***








###### 1 



"[^a]If someone steals an ox or a sheep and slaughters it or sells it, he shall pay five oxen for the ox and four sheep for the sheep-- 







###### 2 



[^b]If the thief is [^c]caught while [^d]breaking in and is struck so that he dies, there will be no guilt for bloodshed on his account. 







###### 3 



If the sun has risen on him, _there will be_ guilt for bloodshed on his account--_A thief_ shall certainly make restitution; if he owns nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft. 







###### 4 



If what he stole is actually found alive in his [^e]possession, whether an ox or a donkey or a sheep, he shall pay double. 







###### 5 



"If someone lets a field or vineyard be grazed _bare_ and lets his animal loose so that it grazes in another person's field, he shall make restitution from the best of his own field and the best of his own vineyard. 







###### 6 



"If a fire breaks out and spreads to thorn bushes, and stacked grain or the standing grain or the field _itself_ is consumed, the one who started the fire must make restitution. 







###### 7 



"If someone gives his neighbor money or goods to keep _for him_ and it is stolen from the [^f]neighbor's house, if the thief is [^g]caught, _then the thief_ shall pay double. 







###### 8 



If the thief is not [^h]caught, then the owner of the house shall [^i]appear before [^j]the judges, _to determine_ whether he [^k]laid his hands on his neighbor's property. 







###### 9 



For every [^l]breach of trust, _whether it is_ for ox, for donkey, for sheep, for clothing, _or_ for any lost thing about which one says, 'This is it,' the [^m]case of both parties shall come before [^n]the judges; he whom [^o]the judges condemn shall pay double to his neighbor. 







###### 10 



"If someone gives his neighbor a donkey, an ox, a sheep, or any animal to keep _for him_, and it dies or is injured or is driven away while no one is looking, 







###### 11 



an oath before the LORD shall be [^p]taken by the two of them [^q]that he has not [^r]laid a hand on his neighbor's property; and its owner shall accept _it_, and he shall not _be compelled to_ make restitution. 







###### 12 



But if it is actually stolen from him, he shall make restitution to its owner. 







###### 13 



If it is all torn to pieces, have him bring it as evidence; he shall not _be compelled to_ make restitution for what has been torn to pieces. 







###### 14 



"And if someone [^s]borrows _an animal_ from his neighbor, and it is injured or dies while its owner is not with it, he shall make full restitution. 







###### 15 



If its owner is with it, _the borrower_ shall not _be compelled to_ make restitution. If it is hired, it [^t]came by its hire. ## Various Laws 







###### 16 



"If a man seduces a virgin who is not [^u]betrothed and sleeps with her, he must pay a [^v]dowry for her _to be_ his wife. 







###### 17 



If her father absolutely refuses to give her to him, he shall [^w]pay money equal to the dowry for virgins. 







###### 18 



"You shall not allow a sorceress to live. 







###### 19 



"Whoever has sexual intercourse with an animal must be put to death. 







###### 20 



"He who sacrifices to [^x]any god, other than to the LORD alone, shall be [^y]utterly destroyed. 







###### 21 



"You shall not oppress a stranger nor torment him, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt. 







###### 22 



You shall not oppress any widow or orphan. 







###### 23 



If you oppress him at all, _and_ if he does cry out to Me, I will assuredly hear his cry; 







###### 24 



and My anger will be kindled, and I will kill you with the sword, and your wives shall become widows and your children fatherless. 







###### 25 



"If you lend money to My people, to the poor [^z]among you, you are not to [^aa]act as a creditor to him; you shall not [^ab]charge him interest. 







###### 26 



If you ever seize your neighbor's cloak as a pledge, you are to return it to him before the sun sets, 







###### 27 



for that is his only covering; it is his cloak for his [^ac]body. What else is he to sleep in? And it will come about that when he cries out to Me, I will listen _to him_, for I am gracious. 







###### 28 



"You shall not [^ad]curse God, nor curse a ruler of your people. 







###### 29 



"You shall not hold back _the offering from_ your entire harvest and your [^ae]wine. The firstborn of your sons you shall give to Me. 







###### 30 



You shall do the same with your oxen _and_ with your sheep. It shall be with its mother for seven days; on the eighth day you shall give it to Me. 







###### 31 



"You shall be holy people to Me, therefore you shall not eat _any_ flesh torn to pieces in the field; you shall throw it to the dogs. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

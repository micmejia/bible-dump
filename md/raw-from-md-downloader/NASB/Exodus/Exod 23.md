# Exodus 23

***








###### 1 



"You shall not give a false report; do not join your hand with a wicked person to be a malicious witness. 







###### 2 



You shall not follow [^a]the crowd in doing evil, nor shall you [^b]testify in a dispute so as to join together with [^c]a crowd in order to pervert _justice_; 







###### 3 



nor shall you [^d]show favor to a poor person in his dispute. 







###### 4 



"If you encounter your enemy's ox or his donkey wandering away, you must return it to him. 







###### 5 



If you see the donkey of one who hates you lying _helpless_ under its load, you shall not leave it _helpless_ for [^e]its owner; you must arrange _the load_ with him. 







###### 6 



"You shall not pervert the justice _due_ to your needy _brother_ in his dispute. 







###### 7 



Keep far from a false charge, and do not kill the innocent or the righteous, for I will not acquit the guilty. 







###### 8 



"You shall not take a bribe, for a bribe blinds the clear-sighted and [^f]subverts the cause of the just. 







###### 9 



"You shall not oppress a stranger, since you yourselves know the [^g]feelings of a stranger, for you _also_ were strangers in the land of Egypt. ## The Sabbath and the Land 







###### 10 



"Now you shall sow your land for six years and gather in its yield, 







###### 11 



but _in_ the seventh year you shall let it [^h]rest and lie uncultivated, so that the needy of your people may eat; and whatever they leave the animal of the field may eat. You are to do the same with your vineyard _and_ your olive grove. 







###### 12 



"For six days you are to do your work, but on the seventh day you shall cease _from labor_ so that your ox and your donkey may rest, and the son of your female slave, as well as the stranger _residing with you, may_ refresh themselves. 







###### 13 



Now concerning everything which I have said to you, be careful; and do not mention the name of other gods, nor let _them_ be heard [^i]from your mouth. ## Three National Feasts 







###### 14 



"Three times a year you shall celebrate a feast to Me. 







###### 15 



You shall keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread; for seven days you are to eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the appointed time in the month of Abib, for in [^j]that month you came out of Egypt. And [^k]no one is to appear before Me empty-handed. 







###### 16 



Also _you shall keep_ the Feast of the Harvest _of_ the first fruits of your labors _from_ what you sow in the field; also the Feast of the Ingathering at the end of the year when you gather in _the fruit of_ your labors from the field. 







###### 17 



Three times a year all your males shall appear before the Lord [^l]God. 







###### 18 



"You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread; nor is the fat of My [^m]feast to remain overnight until morning. 







###### 19 



"You shall bring the choice first fruits of your soil into the house of the LORD your God. "You are not to boil a young goat in the milk of its mother. ## Conquest of the Land 







###### 20 



"Behold, I am going to send an angel before you to guard you along the way and to bring you into the place which I have prepared. 







###### 21 



Be attentive to him and obey his voice; do not be rebellious toward him, for he will not pardon your rebellion, since My name is in him. 







###### 22 



But if you truly obey his voice and do all that I say, then I will be an enemy to your enemies and an adversary to your adversaries. 







###### 23 



For My angel will go before you and bring you into _the land of_ the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I will completely destroy them. 







###### 24 



You shall not worship their gods, nor serve them, nor do according to their deeds; but you shall utterly overthrow them and break their memorial stones in pieces. 







###### 25 



And you shall serve the LORD your God, [^n]and He will bless your bread and your water; and I will remove sickness from your midst. 







###### 26 



There will be no one miscarrying or unable to have children in your land; I will fulfill the number of your days. 







###### 27 



I will send My terror ahead of you, and throw into confusion all the people among whom you come, and I will make all your enemies turn _their_ backs to you. 







###### 28 



And I will send hornets ahead of you so that they will drive out the Hivites, the Canaanites, and the Hittites from you. 







###### 29 



I will not drive them out from you in a single year, so that the land will not become desolate and the animals of the field become too numerous for you. 







###### 30 



I will drive them out from you little by little, until you become fruitful and take possession of the land. 







###### 31 



I will set your boundary from the [^o]Red Sea to the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness to the _Euphrates_ River; for I will hand over the inhabitants of the land to you, and you will drive them out from you. 







###### 32 



You shall [^p]make no covenant with them or with their gods. 







###### 33 



They shall not live in your land, otherwise they will make you sin against Me; for _if_ you serve their gods, it is certain to be a snare to you." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

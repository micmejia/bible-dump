# Exodus 24

***








###### 1 



Then He said to Moses, "Come up to the LORD, you and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel, and you shall worship at a distance. 







###### 2 



Moses alone, however, shall approach the LORD, but they shall not approach, nor shall the people come up with him." 







###### 3 



Then Moses came and reported to the people all the words of the LORD and all the [^a]ordinances; and all the people answered with one voice and said, "All the words which the LORD has spoken we will do!" 







###### 4 



And Moses wrote down all the words of the LORD. Then he got up early in the morning, and built an altar [^b]at the foot of the mountain with twelve memorial stones for the twelve tribes of Israel. 







###### 5 



And he sent young men of the sons of Israel, and they offered burnt offerings and sacrificed bulls as peace offerings to the LORD. 







###### 6 



Moses took half of the blood and put _it_ in basins, and the _other_ half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar. 







###### 7 



Then he took the Book of the Covenant and read _it_ [^c]as the people listened; and they said, "All that the LORD has spoken we will do, and we will be obedient!" 







###### 8 



So Moses took the blood and sprinkled _it_ on the people, and said, "Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD has [^d]made with you [^e]in accordance with all these words." 







###### 9 



Then Moses went up [^f]with Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel, 







###### 10 



and they saw the God of Israel; and under His feet [^g]there appeared to be a pavement of sapphire, [^h]as clear as the sky itself. 







###### 11 



Yet He did not reach out with His hand against the nobles of the sons of Israel; and they saw God, and they ate and drank. 







###### 12 



Now the LORD said to Moses, "Come up to Me on the mountain and [^i]stay there, and I will give you the stone tablets [^j]with the Law and the [^k]commandments which I have written for their instruction." 







###### 13 



So Moses got up [^l]along with Joshua his [^m]servant, and Moses went up to the mountain of God. 







###### 14 



But to the elders he said, "Wait here for us until we return to you. And behold, Aaron and Hur are with you; whoever [^n]has a legal matter, have him approach them." 







###### 15 



Then Moses went up to the mountain, and the cloud covered the mountain. 







###### 16 



The glory of the LORD [^o]settled on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it for six days; and on the seventh day He called to Moses from the midst of the cloud. 







###### 17 



And to the eyes of the sons of Israel, the appearance of the glory of the LORD was like a consuming fire on the mountain top. 







###### 18 



Then Moses entered the midst of the cloud [^p]as he went up to the mountain; and Moses was on the mountain for forty days and forty nights. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

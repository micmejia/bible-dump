# Exodus 25

***








###### 1 



Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 







###### 2 



"Tell the sons of Israel to take a [^a]contribution for Me; from everyone whose heart moves him you shall take My [^b]contribution. 







###### 3 



This is the [^c]contribution which you are to take from them: gold, silver, and bronze, 







###### 4 



[^d]violet, purple, and scarlet _material_, fine linen, goat _hair_, 







###### 5 



rams' skins dyed red, [^e]fine leather, acacia wood, 







###### 6 



oil for lighting, balsam oil for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense, 







###### 7 



onyx stones and setting stones for the ephod and for the [^f]breastpiece. 







###### 8 



Have them construct a sanctuary for Me, so that I may dwell among them. 







###### 9 



According to all that I am going to show you _as_ the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of all its furniture, so you shall construct _it_. ## Ark of the Covenant 







###### 10 



"Now they shall construct an [^g]ark of acacia wood [^h]two and a half cubits [^i]long, one and a half cubits [^j]wide, and one and a half cubits [^k]high. 







###### 11 



You shall overlay it with pure gold, inside and out you shall overlay it, and you shall make a gold molding [^l]around it. 







###### 12 



You shall also cast four gold rings for it and [^m]fasten them on its four feet; two rings shall be on one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it. 







###### 13 



And you shall make poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold. 







###### 14 



You shall put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark, to carry the ark with them. 







###### 15 



The poles shall [^n]remain in the rings of the ark; they shall not be removed from it. 







###### 16 



You shall put into the ark the testimony which I shall give you. 







###### 17 



"And you shall make [^o]an atoning cover of pure gold, [^p]two and a half cubits [^q]long and one and a half cubits [^r]wide. 







###### 18 



You shall make two cherubim of gold; make them of hammered work [^s]at the two ends of the atoning cover. 







###### 19 



Make one cherub [^t]at one end and one cherub [^u]at the other end; you shall make the cherubim _of one piece_ [^v]with the atoning cover at its two ends. 







###### 20 



And the cherubim shall have _their_ wings spread upward, covering the atoning cover with their wings and [^w]facing one another; the faces of the cherubim are to be _turned_ toward the atoning cover. 







###### 21 



Then you shall put the atoning cover [^x]on top of the ark, and in the ark you shall put the testimony which I will give to you. 







###### 22 



There I will meet with you; and from above the atoning cover, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony, I will speak to you about [^y]every commandment that I will give you for the sons of Israel. ## Bread of the Presence 







###### 23 



"You shall also make a table of acacia wood, [^z]two cubits [^aa]long and one cubit [^ab]wide, and one and a half cubits [^ac]high. 







###### 24 



You shall overlay it with pure gold and make a gold border around it. 







###### 25 



And you shall make for it a rim of a [^ad]hand width around _it_; and you shall make a gold border for the rim around it. 







###### 26 



You shall also make four gold rings for it and put rings on the four corners which are on its four legs. 







###### 27 



The rings shall be close to the rim, as holders for the poles to carry the table. 







###### 28 



And you shall make the poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold, so that with them the table may be carried. 







###### 29 



You shall also make its dishes, its pans, its jars, and its libation bowls with which to pour drink offerings; you shall make them of pure gold. 







###### 30 



And you shall set the bread of the [^ae]Presence on the table before Me continually. ## The Golden Lampstand 







###### 31 



"Then you shall make a lampstand of pure gold. The lampstand, its base and its shaft, are to be made of hammered work; its cups, its [^af]bulbs, and its flowers shall be _of one piece_ with it. 







###### 32 



Six branches shall go out from its sides; three branches of the lampstand from its one side and three branches of the lampstand from its [^ag]other side. 







###### 33 



Three cups _shall be_ shaped like almond blossoms on the one branch, a [^ah]bulb and a flower, and three cups shaped like almond blossoms on the [^ai]other branch, a [^aj]bulb and a flower--the same for six branches going out from the lampstand; 







###### 34 



and on the lampstand four cups shaped like almond blossoms, its [^ak]bulbs and its flowers. 







###### 35 



A [^al]bulb shall be under the _first_ pair of branches _coming_ out of it, and a [^am]bulb under the _second_ pair of branches _coming_ out of it, and a [^an]bulb under the _third_ pair of branches _coming_ out of it, for the six branches coming out of the lampstand. 







###### 36 



Their [^ao]bulbs and their branches shall be _of one piece_ with it; all of it _shall be_ one piece of hammered work of pure gold. 







###### 37 



Then you shall make its lamps seven _in number_; and they shall [^ap]mount its lamps so as to shed light on the space in front of it. 







###### 38 



Its tongs and its trays _shall be_ of pure gold. 







###### 39 



It shall be made from a [^aq]talent of pure gold, with all these utensils. 







###### 40 



See that you make _them_ by the pattern for them, which was shown to you on the mountain. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

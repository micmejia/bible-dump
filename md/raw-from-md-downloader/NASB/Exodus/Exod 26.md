Five curtains shall be [^d]joined to one another, and _the other_ five curtains _shall be_ [^e]joined to one another. 







###### 4 



You shall make loops of violet on the edge of the [^f]outermost curtain in the _first_ set, and likewise you shall make _them_ on the edge of the curtain that is outermost in the second [^g]set.

###### 11 



"You shall also make fifty clasps of [^s]bronze, and you shall put the clasps into the loops and [^t]join the tent together so that it will be [^u]a unit. 







###### 12 



The [^v]overhanging part that is left over in the curtains of the tent, the half curtain that is left over, shall hang over the back of the tabernacle. 







###### 13 



The [^w]cubit on one side and the cubit on the other, of what is left over in the length of the curtains of the tent, shall hang over the sides of the tabernacle on one side and on the other, to cover it. 







###### 14 



And you shall make a covering for the tent of rams' skins [^x]dyed red and a covering of [^y]fine leather above. ## Boards and Bases

"Then you shall make the boards for the tabernacle of acacia wood, standing upright. 







###### 16 



[^z]Ten cubits _shall be_ the length of [^aa]each board and one and a half cubits the width of each board. 







###### 17 



_There shall be_ two tenons for each board, [^ab]fitted to one another; that is what you shall do for all the boards of the tabernacle. 







###### 18 



You shall make the boards for the tabernacle: twenty boards [^ac]for the south side. 







###### 19 



You shall make forty bases of silver under the twenty boards, two bases under one board for its two tenons and two bases under another board for its two tenons; 







###### 20 



and for the second side of the tabernacle, on the north side, twenty boards, 







###### 21 



and their forty bases of silver; two bases under one board and two bases under another board. 







###### 22 



For the [^ad]back of the tabernacle, to the west, you shall make six boards. 







###### 23 



You shall make two boards for the corners of the tabernacle at the [^ae]back. 







###### 24 



They shall be double beneath, and together they shall be complete [^af]to its top [^ag]to the first ring; this is how it shall be with both of them: they shall form the two corners. 







###### 25 



And there shall be eight boards with their bases of silver, sixteen bases; two bases under one board and two bases under another board. 







###### 26 



"Then you shall make bars of acacia wood, five for the boards of one side of the tabernacle, 







###### 27 



and five bars for the boards of the [^ah]other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the side of the tabernacle for the [^ai]back _side_ to the west. 







###### 28 



The middle bar in the [^aj]center of the boards shall pass through from end to end. 







###### 29 



And you shall overlay the boards with gold, and make their rings of gold _as_ holders for the bars; and you shall overlay the bars with gold. 







###### 30 



Then you shall erect the tabernacle according to its plan which you have been shown on the mountain. ## The Veil and Curtain 







###### 31 



"You shall also make a veil of violet, purple, and scarlet _material_, and fine twisted linen; it shall be made with cherubim, the work of a skilled embroiderer. 







###### 32 



Then you shall [^ak]hang it on four pillars of acacia overlaid with gold, their hooks _also of_ gold, on four bases of silver. 







###### 33 



You shall [^al]hang up the veil under the clasps, and bring in the ark of the testimony there within the veil; and the veil shall [^am]serve as a partition for you between the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place. 







###### 34 



You shall put the [^an]atoning cover on the ark of the testimony in the Most Holy Place. 







###### 35 



And you shall set the table outside the veil, and the lampstand opposite the table on the side of the tabernacle toward the south; and you shall put the table on the north side. 







###### 36 



"You shall also make a curtain for the doorway of the tent of violet, purple, and scarlet _material_ and fine twisted linen, the work of a [^ao]weaver. 







###### 37 



And you shall make five pillars of acacia for the curtain and overlay them with gold, their hooks _also of_ gold; and you shall cast five bases of [^ap]bronze for them. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

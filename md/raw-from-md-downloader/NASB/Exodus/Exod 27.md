# Exodus 27

***








###### 1 



"Now you shall make the altar of acacia wood, [^a]five cubits long and five cubits wide; the altar shall be square, and its height shall be [^b]three cubits. 







###### 2 



You shall make its horns on its four corners; its horns shall be of one piece with it, and you shall overlay it with [^c]bronze. 







###### 3 



And you shall make its pails for removing its ashes, and its shovels, its basins, its forks, and its firepans; you shall make all its utensils of bronze. 







###### 4 



You shall also make for it a grating, a netting of bronze, and on the netting you shall make four bronze rings [^d]at its four corners. 







###### 5 



And you shall put it under the ledge of the altar, so that the netting will reach halfway up the altar. 







###### 6 



You shall also make carrying poles for the altar, poles of acacia wood and overlay them with bronze. 







###### 7 



Its poles shall be inserted into the rings, so that the poles will be on the two sides of the altar when it is carried. 







###### 8 



You shall make it hollow with planks; as it was shown to you on the mountain, so they shall make _it_. ## Courtyard of the Tabernacle 







###### 9 



"Now you shall make the courtyard of the [^e]tabernacle. [^f]On the south side _there shall be_ hangings for the courtyard of fine twisted linen, a [^g]hundred cubits long for one side; 







###### 10 



and its pillars _shall be_ twenty, with their twenty bases of bronze; the hooks of the pillars and their [^h]bands _shall be_ of silver. 







###### 11

###### 15 



And for the [^n]other [^o]side _there shall be_ hangings of fifteen cubits, _with_ their three pillars and their three bases. 







###### 16 



And for the gate of the courtyard _there shall be_ a curtain of [^p]twenty cubits, of [^q]violet, purple, and scarlet _material_ and fine twisted linen, the work of a [^r]weaver, _with_ their four pillars and their four bases. 







###### 17 



All the pillars around the courtyard shall be joined together _with_ silver, _with_ their hooks of silver and their bases of bronze. 







###### 18 



The length of the courtyard _shall be_ a [^s]hundred cubits, and the width fifty throughout, and the height five cubits of fine twisted linen, and their bases of bronze. 







###### 19 



All the utensils of the tabernacle _used_ in all its service, and all its pegs, and all the pegs of the courtyard, _shall be_ of bronze. 







###### 20 



"And you shall command the sons of Israel that they bring you clear oil of beaten olives for the [^t]light, to make a lamp [^u]burn continually. 







###### 21 



In the tent of meeting, outside the veil which is before the testimony, Aaron and his sons shall keep it in order from evening to morning before the LORD; _it shall be_ a permanent statute throughout their generations [^v]for the sons of Israel. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

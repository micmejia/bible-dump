# Exodus 30

***








###### 1 



"Now you shall make an altar as a place for burning incense; you shall make it of acacia wood. 







###### 2 



Its length _shall be_ [^a]a cubit, and its width a cubit; it shall be square, and its height _shall be_ two cubits; its horns _shall be_ [^b]of one piece with it. 







###### 3 



You shall overlay it with pure gold, its top and its [^c]sides all around, and its horns; and you shall make a gold molding all around for it. 







###### 4 



You shall also make two gold rings for it under its molding; you shall make _them_ on its two sides--on [^d]opposite sides--and [^e]they shall be holders for poles with which to carry it. 







###### 5 



And you shall make the poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold. 







###### 6 



You shall put [^f]this altar in front of the veil that is [^g]near the ark of the testimony, in front of the [^h]atoning cover that is over _the ark of_ the testimony, where I will meet with you. 







###### 7 



Aaron shall burn fragrant incense on it; he shall burn it every morning when he trims the lamps. 







###### 8 



And when Aaron sets up the lamps at [^i]twilight, he shall burn incense. _There shall be_ perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your generations. 







###### 9 



You shall not offer any [^j]strange incense on [^k]this altar, or burnt offering, or meal offering; and you shall not pour out a drink offering on it. 







###### 10 



However, Aaron shall make atonement on its horns once a year; he shall make atonement on it with the blood of the sin offering of atonement once a year throughout your generations. It is most holy to the LORD." 







###### 11 



The LORD also spoke to Moses, saying, 







###### 12 



"When you take a [^l]census of the sons of Israel [^m]to count them, then each one _of them_ shall give a ransom for [^n]himself to the LORD, when you [^o]count them, so that there will be no plague among them when you [^p]count them. 







###### 13 



This _is what_ everyone who [^q]is counted shall give: half a [^r]shekel according to the shekel of the sanctuary (the shekel is twenty gerahs), half a shekel as a [^s]contribution to the LORD. 







###### 14 



Everyone who [^t]is counted, from twenty years old and over, shall give the [^u]contribution to the LORD. 







###### 15 



The rich shall not pay more, and the poor shall not pay less, than the half shekel, when you give the [^v]contribution to the LORD to make atonement for [^w]yourselves. 







###### 16 



And you shall take the atonement money from the sons of Israel and give it for the service of the tent of meeting, so that it may be a memorial for the sons of Israel before the LORD, to make atonement for [^x]yourselves." 







###### 17 



Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 







###### 18 



"You shall also make a basin of [^y]bronze, with its base of bronze, for washing; and you shall put it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and you shall put water in it. 







###### 19 



Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet from it; 







###### 20 



when they enter the tent of meeting, they shall wash with water, so that they do not die; or when they approach the altar to minister, by offering up in smoke a fire _sacrifice_ to the LORD. 







###### 21 



So they shall wash their hands and their feet, so that they do not die; and it shall be a permanent statute for them, for [^z]Aaron and his [^aa]descendants throughout their generations." ## The Anointing Oil 







###### 22 



Moreover, the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 







###### 23 



"Take also for yourself the finest of spices: of liquid myrrh [^ab]five hundred _shekels_, and of fragrant cinnamon half as much, 250, and of fragrant cane 250, 







###### 24 



and of cassia 500, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, and of olive oil a [^ac]hin. 







###### 25 



You shall make [^ad]from these a holy anointing oil, a fragrant mixture of ointments, the work of a perfumer; it shall be a holy anointing oil. 







###### 26 



And you shall anoint the tent of meeting with it, and the ark of the testimony, 







###### 27 



and the table and all its utensils, and the lampstand and its utensils, and the altar of incense, 







###### 28 



and the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and the basin and its stand. 







###### 29 



You shall also consecrate them, so that they may be most holy; whatever touches them shall be holy. 







###### 30 



And you shall anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, so that they may serve as priests to Me. 







###### 31 



Furthermore, you shall speak to the sons of Israel, saying, 'This shall be a holy anointing oil to Me throughout your generations. 







###### 32 



It shall not be poured on [^ae]anyone's body, nor shall you make _any_ like it in [^af]the same proportions; it is holy, _and_ it shall be holy to you. 







###### 33 



Whoever mixes _any_ like it or whoever puts any of it on a [^ag]layman [^ah]shall be cut off from his people.'" ## The Incense 







###### 34 



Then the LORD said to Moses, "Take for yourself spices--stacte, onycha, and galbanum, spices and pure frankincense; there shall be an equal part of each. 







###### 35 



You shall make incense from it _all_, a skillful mixture, the work of a perfumer, salted, pure, _and_ holy. 







###### 36 



And you shall crush some of it very fine, and put part of it in front of the testimony in the tent of meeting where I will meet with you; it shall be most holy to you. 







###### 37 



And the incense which you shall make, you shall not make in [^ai]the same proportions for yourselves; it shall be holy to you for the LORD. 







###### 38 



Whoever makes _any_ like it, to [^aj]use as perfume, [^ak]shall be cut off from his people." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Exodus 31

***








###### 1 



Now the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 







###### 2 



"See, I have called by name Bezalel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah. 







###### 3 



And I have filled him with the Spirit of God in wisdom, in understanding, in knowledge, and in all _kinds of_ [^a]craftsmanship, 







###### 4 



to create [^b]artistic designs for work in gold, in silver, and in [^c]bronze, 







###### 5 



and in the cutting of stones [^d]for settings, and in the carving of wood, so that he may work in all _kinds of_ [^e]craftsmanship. 







###### 6 



And behold, I Myself have [^f]appointed with him Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the hearts of all who are [^g]skillful I have put [^h]skill, so that they may make everything that I have commanded you: 







###### 7 



the tent of meeting, the ark of testimony, the [^i]atoning cover that is on it, and all the furniture of the tent, 







###### 8 



the table and its [^j]utensils, the pure _gold_ lampstand with all its [^k]utensils, and the altar of incense, 







###### 9 



the altar of burnt offering with all its [^l]utensils, and the basin and its stand, 







###### 10 



the [^m]woven garments as well: the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments of his sons, _with which_ to [^n]carry out their priesthood; 







###### 11 



the anointing oil also, and the fragrant incense for the Holy Place, they are to make _them_ according to everything that I have commanded you." ## The Sign of the Sabbath 







###### 12 



Now the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 







###### 13 



"Now as for you, speak to the sons of Israel, saying, 'You must keep My Sabbaths; for _this_ is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations, so that you may know that I am the LORD who sanctifies you. 







###### 14 



Therefore you are to keep the Sabbath, for it is holy to you. Everyone who profanes it must be put to death; for whoever does _any_ work on it, that person shall be cut off from among his people. 







###### 15 



For six days work may be done, but on the seventh day there is a Sabbath of complete rest, holy to the LORD; whoever does _any_ work on the Sabbath day must be put to death. 







###### 16 



So the sons of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to [^o]celebrate the Sabbath throughout their generations as a permanent covenant.' 







###### 17 



It is a sign between Me and the sons of Israel forever; for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, but on the seventh day He ceased _from labor_, and was refreshed." 







###### 18 



When He had finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai, He gave Moses the two tablets of the testimony, tablets of stone, written by the finger of God. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

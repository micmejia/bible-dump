And everyone whose heart [^q]stirred him and everyone whose spirit [^r]moved him came _and_ brought the LORD's [^s]contribution for the work of the tent of meeting and for all its service, and for the holy garments. 







###### 22 



Then all [^t]whose hearts moved them, both men and women, came _and_ brought brooches and [^u]earrings and signet rings and bracelets, all articles of gold; so _did_ everyone who [^v]presented an offering of gold to the LORD.

Then Moses said to the sons of Israel, "See, the LORD has called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.

And He has filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, in knowledge, and in all [^ai]craftsmanship;

to create [^aj]designs for working in gold, in silver, and in [^ak]bronze, 







###### 33 



and in the cutting of stones for settings and in the carving of wood, so as to perform in every inventive work. 







###### 34 



He also has put in his heart to teach, both he and Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.

# Exodus 36

***








###### 1 



"Now Bezalel, Oholiab, and every [^a]skillful person in whom the LORD has put [^b]skill and understanding to know how to perform all the work [^c]in the construction of the sanctuary, shall perform in accordance with everything that the LORD has commanded." 







###### 2 



Then Moses called Bezalel, Oholiab, and every [^d]skillful person in [^e]whom the LORD had put [^f]skill, everyone whose heart stirred him, to come to the work to perform it. 







###### 3 



They received from Moses every [^g]contribution which the sons of Israel had brought to perform [^h]the work [^i]in the construction of the sanctuary. And they still _continued_ bringing to him [^j]voluntary offerings every morning. 







###### 4 



And all the [^k]skillful people who were performing all the work of the sanctuary came, each from [^l]the work which they were performing, 







###### 5 



and they said to [^m]Moses, "The people are bringing much more than enough for the [^n]construction work which the LORD commanded _us_ to [^o]perform." 







###### 6 



So Moses issued a command, and circulated a [^p]proclamation throughout the camp, saying, "No man or woman is to perform work any longer for the [^q]contributions of the sanctuary." So the people were restrained from bringing _any more_. 







###### 7 



For the [^r]material they had was sufficient and more than enough for all the work, to perform it. ## Construction Begins 







###### 8 



All the [^s]skillful people among those who were performing the work made the [^t]tabernacle with ten curtains; of fine twisted linen and [^u]violet, purple, and scarlet _material_, with cherubim, the work of a skilled embroiderer, [^v]Bezalel made them. 







###### 9 



The length of each curtain was [^w]twenty-eight cubits, and the width of each curtain four cubits; all the curtains had [^x]the same measurements. 







###### 10 



He [^y]joined five curtains to one another, and _the other_ five curtains he [^z]joined to one another. 







###### 11 



And he made loops of violet on the edge of the [^aa]outermost curtain in the first [^ab]set; he did likewise on the edge of the curtain that was [^ac]outermost in the second [^ad]set. 







###### 12 



He made fifty loops in the one curtain, and he made fifty loops on the [^ae]edge of the curtain that was in the second [^af]set; the loops were opposite each other. 







###### 13 



He also made fifty clasps of gold, and [^ag]joined the curtains to one another with the clasps, so that the tabernacle was [^ah]a unit. 







###### 14 



Then he made curtains of goats' _hair_ for a tent over the tabernacle; he [^ai]made eleven curtains _in all_. 







###### 15 



The length of each curtain _was_ thirty cubits, and four cubits _was_ the width of each curtain; the eleven curtains had [^aj]the same measurements. 







###### 16 



He [^ak]joined five curtains by themselves, and _the other_ six curtains by themselves. 







###### 17 



Moreover, he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was outermost in the _first_ [^al]set, and he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain _that was outermost in_ the second [^am]set. 







###### 18 



He also made fifty clasps of [^an]bronze to [^ao]join the tent together so that it would be [^ap]a unit. 







###### 19 



And he made a covering for the tent of rams' skins [^aq]dyed red, and a covering of [^ar]fine leather above. 







###### 20 



Then he made the boards for the tabernacle of acacia wood, standing upright. 







###### 21 



Ten cubits _was_ the length of [^as]each board, and one and a half cubits the width of each board. 







###### 22 



_There were_ two tenons for each board, [^at]fitted to one another; he did this to all the boards of the tabernacle. 







###### 23 



So he made the boards for the tabernacle: twenty boards [^au]for the south side; 







###### 24 



and he made forty bases of silver under the twenty boards; two bases under one board for its two tenons, and two bases under another board for its two tenons. 







###### 25 



Then for the second side of the tabernacle, on the north side, he made twenty boards, 







###### 26 



and their forty bases of silver; two bases under one board, and two bases under another board. 







###### 27 



And for the [^av]back of the tabernacle, to the west, he made six boards. 







###### 28 



He made two boards for the corners of the [^aw]tabernacle at the [^ax]back. 







###### 29 



They were double beneath, and together they were complete to its [^ay]top, [^az]to the first ring; he did this with both of them for the two corners. 







###### 30 



There were eight boards with their bases of silver, sixteen bases, two bases under every board. 







###### 31 



Then he made bars of acacia wood, five for the boards of one side of the tabernacle, 







###### 32 



and five bars for the boards of the [^ba]other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the [^bb]back _side_ to the west. 







###### 33 



And he made the middle bar to pass through in the [^bc]center of the boards from end to end. 







###### 34 



Then he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold _as_ holders for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold. 







###### 35 



Moreover, he made the veil of violet, purple, and scarlet _material_, and fine twisted linen; he made it with cherubim, the work of a skilled embroiderer. 







###### 36 



And he made four pillars of acacia for it, and overlaid them with gold, with their hooks of gold; and he cast four bases of silver for them. 







###### 37 



He also made a curtain for the doorway of the tent, of violet, purple, and scarlet _material_, and fine twisted linen, the work of a [^bd]weaver; 







###### 38 



and _he made_ its five pillars with their hooks, and he overlaid their tops and their [^be]bands with gold; but their five bases were of [^bf]bronze. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

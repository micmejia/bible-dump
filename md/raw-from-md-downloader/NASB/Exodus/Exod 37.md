# Exodus 37

***








###### 1 



Now Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood; its length was [^a]two and a half cubits, its width one and a half cubits, and its height one and a half cubits; 







###### 2 



and he overlaid it with pure gold inside and out, and made a gold molding for it all around. 







###### 3 



He cast four rings of gold for it on its four feet; two rings on one side of it, and two rings on the [^b]other side of it. 







###### 4 



And he made poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold. 







###### 5 



He put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark, to carry [^c]it. 







###### 6 



He also made [^d]an atoning cover of pure gold, two and a half cubits [^e]long and one and a half cubits [^f]wide. 







###### 7 



And he made two cherubim of gold; he made them of hammered work [^g]at the two ends of the atoning cover: 







###### 8 



one cherub [^h]at the one end and one cherub [^i]at the other end; he made the cherubim _of one piece_ with the atoning cover [^j]at the two ends. 







###### 9 



And the cherubim had _their_ wings spread upward, covering the atoning cover with their wings, with their faces toward each other; the faces of the cherubim were toward the atoning cover. 







###### 10 



Then he made the table of acacia wood, [^k]two cubits [^l]long, a cubit [^m]wide, and one and a half cubits [^n]high. 







###### 11 



He overlaid it with pure gold, and made a gold molding for it all around. 







###### 12 



And he made a rim for it of a [^o]hand width all around, and made a gold molding for its rim all around. 







###### 13 



He also cast four gold rings for it and put the rings on the four corners that were on its four legs. 







###### 14 



Close by the rim were the rings, the holders for the poles to carry the table. 







###### 15 



And he made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold, to carry the table. 







###### 16 



He also made the utensils which were on the table, its dishes, its pans, its libation bowls, and its jars, with which to pour out drink offerings, of pure gold. 







###### 17 



Then he made the lampstand of pure gold. He made the lampstand of hammered work, its base and its shaft; its cups, its [^p]bulbs, and its flowers were _of one piece_ with it. 







###### 18 



There were six branches going out of its sides; three branches of the lampstand from the one side of it and three branches of the lampstand from the [^q]other side of it; 







###### 19 



three cups shaped like almond _blossoms_, a [^r]bulb and a flower on one branch, and three cups shaped like almond _blossoms_, a [^s]bulb and a flower on the other branch--so for the six branches going out of the lampstand. 







###### 20 



And on the lampstand _there were_ four cups shaped like almond _blossoms_, its [^t]bulbs and its flowers; 







###### 21 



and a [^u]bulb was under the _first_ pair of branches _coming_ out of it, and a [^v]bulb under the _second_ pair of branches _coming_ out of it, and a [^w]bulb under the _third_ pair of branches _coming_ out of it, for the six branches coming out of the lampstand. 







###### 22 



Their [^x]bulbs and their branches were _of one piece_ with it; the whole of it _was_ a single hammered work of pure gold. 







###### 23 



And he made its seven lamps with its tongs and its trays of pure gold. 







###### 24 



He made it and all its utensils from a [^y]talent of pure gold. 







###### 25 



Then he made the altar of incense of acacia wood: a cubit [^z]long and a cubit [^aa]wide, square, and two cubits [^ab]high; its horns were _of one piece_ with it. 







###### 26 



And he overlaid it with pure gold, its top and its [^ac]sides all around, and its horns; and he made a gold molding for it all around. 







###### 27 



He also made two golden rings for it under its molding, on its two sides--on opposite sides--as holders for poles with which to carry it. 







###### 28 



And he made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold. 







###### 29 



Then he made the holy anointing oil and the pure, fragrant incense of spices, the work of a perfumer. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

***








###### 1 



Then he made the altar of burnt offering of acacia wood, [^a]five cubits [^b]long, and five cubits [^c]wide, square, and three cubits [^d]high. 







###### 2 



And he made its horns on its four corners, its horns [^e]being _of one piece_ with it, and he overlaid it with [^f]bronze. 







###### 3 



He also made all the utensils of the altar, the pails, the shovels, the basins, the meat-forks, and the firepans; he made all its utensils of bronze. 







###### 4 



And he made for the altar a grating of bronze netting beneath, under its ledge, reaching halfway up. 







###### 5 



He also cast four rings on the four ends of the bronze grating _as_ holders for the poles. 







###### 6 



He made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with bronze. 







###### 7 



Then he inserted the poles into the rings on the sides of the altar, with which to carry it. He made it hollow with planks. 







###### 8 



Moreover, he made the basin of bronze with its base of bronze, [^g]from the mirrors of the serving women who served at the doorway of the tent of meeting. 







###### 9 



Then he made the courtyard: [^h]for the south side the hangings of the courtyard were of fine twisted linen, a hundred cubits; 







###### 10 



their twenty pillars, and their twenty bases, _were made_ of bronze; the hooks of the pillars and their [^i]bands _were_ of silver. 







###### 11 



For the north side _there were_ a hundred cubits; their twenty pillars and their twenty bases _were_ of bronze, the hooks of the pillars and their [^j]bands _were_ of silver. 







###### 12 



For the west side _there were_ hangings of fifty cubits _with_ their ten pillars and their ten bases; the hooks of the pillars and their [^k]bands _were_ of silver. 







###### 13 



For the [^l]east side, fifty cubits. 







###### 14 



The hangings for the _one_ [^m]side _of the gate were_ fifteen cubits, _with_ their three pillars and their three bases, 







###### 15 



and so for the [^n]other [^o]side. [^p]On both sides of the gate of the courtyard _were_ hangings of fifteen cubits, _with_ their three pillars and their three bases. 







###### 16 



All the hangings of the courtyard all around _were_ of fine twisted linen. 







###### 17 



And the bases for the pillars _were_ of bronze, the hooks of the pillars and their [^q]bands, of silver; and the overlaying of their tops, of silver, and all the pillars of the courtyard were furnished with silver [^r]bands. 







###### 18 



Now the curtain of the gate of the courtyard was the work of the [^s]weaver, of [^t]violet, purple, and scarlet _material_ and fine twisted linen. And the length _was_ twenty cubits and the [^u]height _was_ five cubits, corresponding to the hangings of the courtyard. 







###### 19 



Their four pillars and their four bases _were_ of bronze; their hooks _were_ of silver, and the overlaying of their tops and their [^v]bands _were_ of silver. 







###### 20 



All the pegs of the [^w]tabernacle and of the courtyard all around _were_ of bronze. ## The Cost of the Tabernacle 







###### 21 



[^x]This is the number of the things for the [^y]tabernacle, the [^z]tabernacle of the testimony, as they were [^aa]counted according to the [^ab]command of Moses, for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest. 







###### 22 



Now Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made everything that the LORD had commanded Moses. 







###### 23 



With him _was_ Oholiab the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver and a skilled embroiderer, and a [^ac]weaver in violet, in purple, and in scarlet _material_, and fine linen. 







###### 24 



All the gold that was used for the work, in all the work of the sanctuary, [^ad]which was the gold of the wave offering, was twenty-nine [^ae]talents and 730 [^af]shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary. 







###### 25 



And the silver of those of the congregation who were [^ag]counted was a hundred talents and 1,775 shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary; 







###### 26 



a beka a head (_that is_, half a shekel according to the shekel of the sanctuary), _assessed_ to each one who passed over to those who were [^ah]counted, from twenty years old and upward, for 603,550 men. 







###### 27 



The hundred talents of silver were _used_ for casting the bases of the sanctuary and the bases of the veil; a hundred bases for the hundred talents, a talent for a base. 







###### 28 



And of the 1,775 _shekels_, he made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their tops and made [^ai]bands for them. 







###### 29 



And the bronze of the wave offering was seventy talents and 2,400 shekels. 







###### 30 



With it he made the bases to the doorway of the tent of meeting, and the bronze altar and its bronze grating, and all the utensils of the altar, 







###### 31

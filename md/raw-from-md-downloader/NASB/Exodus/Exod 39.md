# Exodus 39

***








###### 1 



Now from the [^a]violet, purple, and scarlet _material_ they made finely woven garments for ministering in the Holy Place, [^b]as well as the holy garments which were for Aaron, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. 







###### 2 



He made the ephod of gold _and_ of violet, purple, and scarlet _material_, and fine twisted linen. 







###### 3 



Then they hammered out gold sheets and cut _them_ into threads [^c]to be woven in _with_ the violet, the purple, and the scarlet _material_, and the fine linen, the work of a skilled embroiderer. 







###### 4 



They made attaching shoulder pieces for [^d]the ephod; it was attached at its two _upper_ ends. 







###### 5 



And the skillfully woven band of its overlay which was on it was like its workmanship, [^e]of the same material: of gold _and_ of violet, purple, and scarlet _material_, and fine twisted linen, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. 







###### 6 



They also made the onyx stones, set in gold filigree _settings_; they were engraved _like_ the engravings of a signet, according to the names of the sons of Israel. 







###### 7 



And he placed them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod _as_ memorial stones for the sons of Israel, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. 







###### 8 



And he made the breastpiece, the work of a skilled embroiderer, like the workmanship of the ephod: of gold _and_ of violet, purple, and scarlet _material_ and fine twisted linen. 







###### 9 



It was square; they made the breastpiece folded double, a [^f]span [^g]long and a span [^h]wide when folded double. 







###### 10 



And they [^i]mounted four rows of stones on it. The first row _was_ a row of ruby, topaz, and emerald; 







###### 11 



and the second row, a turquoise, a sapphire, and a diamond; 







###### 12 



and the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst; 







###### 13 



and the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper. They were set in gold filigree _settings_ when they were [^j]mounted. 







###### 14 



The stones corresponded to the names of the sons of Israel; they were twelve, corresponding to their names, _engraved with_ the engravings of a signet, each with its name for the twelve tribes. 







###### 15 



And they made for the breastpiece chains like cords, work of twisted cords of pure gold. 







###### 16 



They made two gold filigree _settings_ and two gold rings, and put the two rings on the two ends of the breastpiece. 







###### 17 



Then they put the two gold cords in the two rings at the ends of the breastpiece. 







###### 18 



And they put the _other_ two ends of the two cords on the two filigree _settings_, and put them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod at the front of it. 







###### 19 



They made two gold rings and placed _them_ on the two ends of the breastpiece, on its inner edge which was next to the ephod. 







###### 20 



Furthermore, they made two gold rings and placed them on the bottom of the two shoulder pieces of the ephod, on the front of it, close to the place where it joined, above the woven band of the ephod. 







###### 21 



And they bound the breastpiece by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a violet cord, so that it would be on the woven band of the ephod, and that the breastpiece would not come loose from the ephod, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. 







###### 22 



Then he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of violet; 







###### 23 



and the opening of the robe was _at the top_ in the center, as the opening of a coat of mail, with a binding all around its opening, so that it would not be torn. 







###### 24 



And they made pomegranates of violet, purple, and scarlet _material and_ twisted _linen_ on the hem of the robe. 







###### 25 



They also made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates all around on the hem of the [^k]robe, 







###### 26 



[^l]alternating a bell and a pomegranate all around on the hem of the robe for the service, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. 







###### 27 



They also made the tunics of finely woven linen for Aaron and his sons, 







###### 28 



and the turban of fine linen, and the decorated [^m]caps of fine linen, and the linen undergarments of fine twisted linen, 







###### 29 



and the sash of fine twisted linen, and violet, purple, and scarlet _material_, the work of the [^n]weaver, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. 







###### 30 



They also made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and [^o]inscribed it like the engravings of a signet, "Holy to the LORD." 







###### 31 



Then they [^p]fastened a violet cord to it, to [^q]fasten it on the turban above, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. 







###### 32 



So all the work of the [^r]tabernacle of the tent of meeting was completed; and the sons of Israel did according to all that the LORD had commanded Moses; so they did. 







###### 33 



Then they brought the tabernacle to Moses, the tent and all its [^s]furnishings: its clasps, its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its bases; 







###### 34 



and the covering of rams' skins [^t]dyed red, and the covering of [^u]fine leather, and the covering curtain; 







###### 35 



the ark of the testimony, its poles, and the [^v]atoning cover; 







###### 36 



the table, all its utensils, and the bread of the [^w]Presence; 







###### 37 



the pure _gold_ lampstand, [^x]with its arrangement of lamps and all its utensils, and the oil for the light; 







###### 38 



and the gold altar, and the anointing oil and the fragrant incense, and the curtain for the doorway of the tent; 







###### 39 



the [^y]bronze altar and its [^z]bronze grating, its poles and all its utensils, the basin and its stand; 







###### 40 



the hangings for the courtyard, its pillars and its bases, and the curtain for the gate of the courtyard, its ropes and its pegs, and all the [^aa]equipment for the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of meeting; 







###### 41 



the woven garments for ministering in the Holy Place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments of his sons, to serve as priests. 







###### 42 



So the sons of Israel did all the work according to everything that the LORD had commanded Moses. 







###### 43 



And Moses [^ab]examined all the work, and behold, they had done it; just as the LORD had commanded, this they had done. So Moses blessed them. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

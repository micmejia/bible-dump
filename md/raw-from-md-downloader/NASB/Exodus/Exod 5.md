# Exodus 5

***








###### 1 



And afterward Moses and Aaron came and said to Pharaoh, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel says: 'Let My people go so that they may celebrate a feast to Me in the wilderness.'" 







###### 2 



But Pharaoh said, "Who is the LORD that I should obey His voice to let Israel go? I do not know the LORD, and besides, I will not let Israel go." 







###### 3 



Then they said, "The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please, let us go a three days' journey into the wilderness so that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God, otherwise He will strike us with plague or with the sword." 







###### 4 



But the king of Egypt said to them, "Moses and Aaron, why do you let the people neglect their [^a]work? Get _back_ to your labors!" 







###### 5 



Again Pharaoh said, "Look, the people of the land are now many, and you would have them cease from their labors!" 







###### 6 



So the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters over the people and their foremen, saying, 







###### 7 



"You are no longer to give the people straw to make bricks as previously; have them go and gather straw for themselves. 







###### 8 



But you shall impose on them the quota of bricks which they were making before; you are not to reduce any of it. Because they are lazy, for that reason they cry [^b]out, 'Let us go and sacrifice to our God.' 







###### 9 



Let the labor be heavier on the men, and have them work at it so that they will pay no attention to false words." 







###### 10 



So the taskmasters of the people and their foremen went out and spoke to the people, saying, "This is what Pharaoh says: 'I am not going to give you _any_ straw. 







###### 11 



You go, get straw for yourselves wherever you can find _it_; but none of your labor will be reduced.'" 







###### 12 



So the people scattered through all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw. 







###### 13 



And the taskmasters pressed them, saying, "Complete your [^c]work quota, [^d]_your_ daily amount, just as when [^e]you had straw." 







###### 14 



Moreover, the foremen of the sons of Israel, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten [^f]and asked, "Why have you not completed your required task of making bricks either yesterday or today, as before?" 







###### 15 



Then the foremen of the sons of Israel came and cried out to Pharaoh, saying, "Why do you deal this way with your servants? 







###### 16 



There is no straw given to your servants, yet they keep saying to us, 'Make bricks!' And behold, your servants are being beaten; but it is the fault of your _own_ people." 







###### 17 



But he said, "You are lazy, _very_ lazy; for that reason you say, 'Let us go _and_ sacrifice to the LORD.' 







###### 18 



So go now _and_ work; for you will be given no straw, but you must deliver the quota of bricks." 







###### 19 



The foremen of the sons of Israel saw that they were in trouble, [^g]since they were told, "You must not reduce [^h]your daily amount of bricks." 







###### 20 



When they left Pharaoh's presence, they met Moses and Aaron as they were [^i]waiting for them. 







###### 21 



And they said to them, "May the LORD look upon you and judge _you_, because you have made [^j]us repulsive in Pharaoh's sight and in the sight of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to kill us!" 







###### 22 



Then Moses returned to the LORD and said, "Lord, why have You brought harm to this people? Why did You ever send me? 







###### 23 



Ever since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, he has done harm to this people, and You have not rescued Your people at all." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Exodus 6

***








###### 1 



Then the LORD said to Moses, "Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh; for [^a]under compulsion he will let them go, and [^b]under compulsion he will drive them out of his land." 







###### 2 



God spoke further to Moses and said to him, "I am the LORD; 







###### 3 



and I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as [^c]God Almighty, but _by_ My name, [^d]LORD, I did not make Myself known to them. 







###### 4 



I also established My covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the [^e]land in which they lived as strangers. 







###### 5 



Furthermore I have heard the groaning of the sons of Israel, because the Egyptians are holding them in bondage, and I have remembered My covenant. 







###### 6 



Say, therefore, to the sons of Israel, 'I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the labors of the Egyptians, and I will rescue you from their bondage. I will also redeem you with an outstretched arm, and with great judgments. 







###### 7 



Then I will take you [^f]as My people, and I will be [^g]your God; and you shall know that I am the LORD your God, who brought you out from under the labors of the Egyptians. 







###### 8 



I will bring you to the land which I [^h]swore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and I will give it to you _as_ a possession; I am the LORD.'" 







###### 9 



So Moses said this to the sons of Israel, but they did not listen to Moses on account of _their_ [^i]despondency and cruel bondage. 







###### 10 



Now the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 







###### 11 



"Go, [^j]tell Pharaoh king of Egypt [^k]to let the sons of Israel go out of his land." 







###### 12 



But Moses spoke before the LORD, saying, "Behold, the sons of Israel have not listened to me; how then will Pharaoh listen to me, as I am [^l]unskilled in speech?" 







###### 13 



Nevertheless, the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron and gave them a command concerning the sons of Israel and Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt. ## The Heads of Israel 







###### 14 



These are the heads of their fathers' households. The sons of Reuben, Israel's firstborn: Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi; these are the families of Reuben. 







###### 15 



And the sons of Simeon: [^m]Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman; these are the families of Simeon. 







###### 16 



And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari; and the [^n]length of Levi's life was 137 years. 







###### 17 



The sons of Gershon: [^o]Libni and Shimei, according to their families. 







###### 18 



And the sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel; and the [^p]length of Kohath's life was 133 years. 







###### 19 



And the sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their generations. 







###### 20 



Now Amram [^q]married his father's sister Jochebed, and she bore him Aaron and Moses; and the [^r]length of Amram's life was 137 years. 







###### 21 



And the sons of Izhar: Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri. 







###### 22 



And the sons of Uzziel: Mishael, [^s]Elzaphan, and Sithri. 







###### 23 



Aaron [^t]married Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab, the sister of Nahshon, and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. 







###### 24 



And the sons of Korah: Assir, Elkanah, and [^u]Abiasaph; these are the families of the Korahites. 







###### 25 



Now Aaron's son Eleazar [^v]married one of the daughters of Putiel, and she bore him Phinehas. These are the heads of the fathers' _households_ of the Levites according to their families. 







###### 26 



It was _the same_ Aaron and Moses to whom the LORD said, "Bring out the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their [^w]multitudes." 







###### 27 



They were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt [^x]about bringing out the sons of Israel from Egypt; it was _the same_ Moses and Aaron. 







###### 28 



Now it came about on the day when the LORD spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt, 







###### 29 



that the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, "I am the LORD; say to Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say to you." 







###### 30 



But Moses said before the LORD, "Behold, I am [^y]unskilled in speech; how then will Pharaoh listen to me?" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

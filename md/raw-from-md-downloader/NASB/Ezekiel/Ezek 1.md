# Ezekiel 1

***








###### 1 



Now it came about in the thirtieth year, on the fifth _day_ of the fourth month, while I was by the river Chebar among the exiles, the heavens were opened and I saw [^a]visions of God. 







###### 2 



(On the fifth of the month [^b]in the fifth year of King Jehoiachin's exile, 







###### 3 



the word of the LORD came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and there the hand of the LORD came upon him.) 







###### 4 



As I looked, behold, a high wind was coming from the north, a great cloud with fire flashing intermittently and a bright light around it, and in its midst _something_ like gleaming [^c]metal in the midst of the fire. 







###### 5 



And within it there were figures resembling four living beings. And this was their appearance: they had human form. 







###### 6 



Each of them had four faces and four wings. 







###### 7 



Their legs were straight and [^d]their feet were like a calf's [^e]hoof, and they sparkled like polished bronze. 







###### 8 



Under their wings on their four sides _were_ human hands. As for the faces and wings of the four of them, 







###### 9 



their wings touched one another; _their faces_ did not turn when they moved, each went straight forward. 







###### 10 



As for the form of their faces, _each had_ a human face; [^f]all four had the face of a lion on the right and the face of a bull on the left, and [^g]all four had the face of an eagle. 







###### 11 



Such were their faces. Their wings were spread out above; each had two touching another _being_, and two covering their bodies. 







###### 12 



And each went straight forward; wherever the spirit was about to go, they would go, without turning as they went. 







###### 13 



[^h]In the midst of the living beings there was something that looked like burning coals of fire, [^i]like torches moving among the living beings. The fire was bright, and lightning was [^j]flashing from the fire. 







###### 14 



And the living beings ran back and forth like bolts of lightning. 







###### 15 



Now as I looked at the living beings, behold, there was one wheel on the ground beside the living beings, for [^k]each of the four of them. 







###### 16 



The appearance of the wheels and their workmanship _was_ like [^l]sparkling topaz, and all four of them had the same form, their appearance and workmanship _being_ as if [^m]one wheel were within another. 







###### 17 



Whenever they [^n]moved, they [^o]moved in _any_ of their four [^p]directions without turning as they [^q]moved. 







###### 18 



As for their rims, they were high and awesome, and the rims of all four of them were [^r]covered with eyes all around. 







###### 19 



Whenever the living beings [^s]moved, the wheels [^t]moved with them. And whenever the living beings rose from the earth, the wheels rose _also_. 







###### 20 



Wherever the spirit was about to go, they would go in that direction[^u]. And the wheels rose just as they _did_; for the spirit of the living [^v]beings _was_ in the wheels. 







###### 21 



Whenever those went, they went; and whenever those stopped, they stopped. And whenever those rose from the earth, the wheels rose just as they _did_; for the spirit of the living [^w]beings _was_ in the wheels. ## Vision of Divine Glory 







###### 22 



Now over the heads of the living [^x]beings _there was_ something like an expanse, like the awesome gleam of crystal, spread out over their heads. 







###### 23 



Under the expanse their wings _were stretched out_ straight, one toward the other; each one also had two _wings_ covering its body on the one side and on the other. 







###### 24 



And I also heard the sound of their wings, like the sound of abundant waters as they went, like the voice of [^y]the Almighty, a sound of a crowd like the sound of an army camp; whenever they stopped, they let down their wings. 







###### 25 



And a voice came from above the expanse that was over their heads; whenever they stood still, they let down their wings. 







###### 26 



Now above the expanse that was over their heads there was something resembling a throne, like [^z]lapis lazuli in appearance; and on that which resembled a throne, high up, _was_ a figure with the appearance of a man. 







###### 27 



Then I [^aa]noticed from the appearance of His waist and upward _something_ like gleaming [^ab]metal that looked like fire all around within it, and from the appearance of His waist and downward I saw something like fire; and _there was_ a radiance around Him. 







###### 28 



Like the appearance of the rainbow [^ac]in the clouds on a rainy day, so _was_ the appearance of the surrounding radiance. Such _was_ the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw _it_, I fell on my face and heard a voice speaking. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Ezekiel 11

***








###### 1 



Now the Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the east gate of the LORD's house which faced eastward. And behold, _there were_ twenty-five men at the entrance of the gate, and among them I saw Jaazaniah son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, leaders of the people. 







###### 2 



Then He said to me, "Son of man, these are the men who devise wrongdoing and give evil advice in this city, 







###### 3 



who say, '_The time_ is not near to build houses. [^a]This _city_ is the pot and we are the meat.' 







###### 4 



Therefore, prophesy against them, prophesy, son of man!" 







###### 5 



Then the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and He said to me, "Say, 'This is what the LORD says: "This is how you think, house of Israel, for I know [^b]your thoughts. 







###### 6 



You have multiplied your slain in this city, and filled its streets with [^c]them." 







###### 7 



Therefore, this is what the Lord [^d]God says: "Your slain whom you have laid in the midst of [^e]the city are the meat and this _city_ is the pot; but [^f]I will bring you out of it. 







###### 8 



You have feared a sword; so I will bring a sword upon you," the Lord God declares. 







###### 9 



"And I will bring you out of the midst of [^g]the city, and hand you over to strangers, and execute judgments against you. 







###### 10 



You will fall by the sword. I will judge you to the border of Israel; so you shall know that I am the LORD. 







###### 11 



This _city_ will not be a pot for you, nor will you be meat in the midst of it; I will judge you to the border of Israel. 







###### 12 



So you will know that I am the LORD; for you have not walked in My statutes, nor have you executed My ordinances, but you have acted in accordance with the ordinances of the nations around you."'" 







###### 13 



Now it came about, as I prophesied, that Pelatiah son of Benaiah died. Then I fell on my face and cried out with a loud voice, and said, "Oh, Lord God! Will You bring the remnant of Israel to a complete destruction?" ## Promise of Restoration 







###### 14 



Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 







###### 15 



"Son of man, your brothers, your relatives, [^h]your fellow exiles, and the entire house of Israel, all of them, _are those_ to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, 'Keep far from the LORD; this land has been given to us as a possession.' 







###### 16 



Therefore say, 'This is what the Lord God says: "Though I had removed them far away among the nations, and though I had scattered them among the countries, yet I was a sanctuary for them for a little while in the countries where they had gone."' 







###### 17 



Therefore say, 'This is what the Lord God says: "I will gather you from the peoples and assemble you from the countries among which you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel."' 







###### 18 



When they come there, they will remove all its detestable things and all its abominations from it. 







###### 19 



And I will give them one heart, and put a new spirit within [^i]them. And I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh, 







###### 20 



so that they may walk in My statutes, and keep My ordinances and do them. Then they will be My people, and I shall be their God. 







###### 21 



[^j]But as for those whose hearts go after their detestable things and abominations, I will [^k]bring their conduct down on their heads," declares the Lord God. 







###### 22 



Then the cherubim lifted up their wings with the wheels beside them, and the glory of the God of Israel [^l]hovered over them. 







###### 23 



The glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city and stood over the mountain which is east of the city. 







###### 24 



And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God to [^m]Chaldea, to the exiles. Then the vision that I had seen [^n]left me. 







###### 25 



And I told the exiles all the things that the LORD had shown me. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

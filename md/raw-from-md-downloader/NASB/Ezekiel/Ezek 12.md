# Ezekiel 12

***








###### 1 



Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 







###### 2 



"Son of man, you live in the midst of the rebellious house, who have eyes to see but do not see, ears to hear but do not hear; for they are a rebellious house. 







###### 3 



So as for you, son of man, prepare for yourself baggage for exile and go into exile by day in their sight; that is, go into exile from your place to another place in their sight. Perhaps they will [^a]understand, though they are a rebellious house. 







###### 4 



Bring your baggage out by day in their sight, as baggage for exile. Then you shall go out at evening in their sight, as those who are going into exile. 







###### 5 



Dig a hole through the wall in their sight and [^b]go out through it. 







###### 6 



Load _the baggage_ on _your_ shoulder in their sight _and_ carry _it_ out in the dark. You shall cover your face so that you cannot see the land, for I have set you as a sign to the house of Israel." 







###### 7 



Then I did so, just as I had been commanded. By day I brought out my baggage like the baggage of an exile. Then in the evening I dug through the wall with my hands; I went out in the dark _and_ carried _the baggage_ on _my_ shoulder in their sight. 







###### 8 



And in the morning the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 







###### 9 



"Son of man, has the house of Israel, the rebellious house, not said to you, 'What are you doing?' 







###### 10 



Say to them, 'This is what the Lord [^c]God says: "This pronouncement _concerns_ the prince in Jerusalem as well as all the house of Israel who are [^d]in it."' 







###### 11 



Say, 'I am [^e]a sign to you. Just as I have done, so it will be done to them; they will go into exile, into captivity.' 







###### 12 



The prince who is among them will load _his baggage_ on _his_ shoulder in the dark and go out. [^f]They will dig a hole through the wall to bring _it_ out through it. He will cover his face so that he cannot see the land with _his_ eyes. 







###### 13 



I will also spread My net over him, and he will be caught in My net. And I will bring him to Babylon in the land of the Chaldeans; yet he will not see it, though he will die there. 







###### 14 



And I will scatter to every wind all who are around him, his helpers and all his troops; and I will draw out a sword after them. 







###### 15 



So they will know that I am the LORD, when I disperse them among the nations and scatter them among the countries. 







###### 16 



But I will [^g]spare a few of them from the sword, the famine, and plague so that they may tell of all their abominations among the nations where they go, and [^h]may know that I am the LORD." 







###### 17 



Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 







###### 18 



"Son of man, eat your bread with trembling, and drink your water with quivering and anxiety. 







###### 19 



Then say to the people of the land, 'This is what the Lord God says concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem in the land of Israel: "They will eat their bread with anxiety and drink their water with horror, because [^i]their land will be [^j]stripped of its fullness on account of the violence of all who live in it. 







###### 20 



The inhabited cities will be in ruins, and the land will be a desolation. So you will know that I am the LORD."'" 







###### 21 



Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 







###### 22 



"Son of man, what is this proverb you _people_ have about the land of Israel, saying, 'The days are long, and every vision fails'? 







###### 23 



Therefore say to them, 'This is what the Lord God says: "I will put an end to this proverb so that they will no longer use it as a proverb in Israel." But tell them, "The days are approaching as well as the [^k]fulfillment of every vision. 







###### 24 



For there will no longer be any [^l]false vision or deceptive divination within the house of Israel. 







###### 25 



For I the LORD will speak whatever word I speak, and it will be performed. It will no longer be delayed, for in your days, you rebellious house, I will speak the word and perform it," declares the Lord God.'" 







###### 26 



Furthermore, the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 







###### 27 



"Son of man, behold, the house of Israel is saying, 'The vision that he sees is for many [^m]years _from now_, and he prophesies of times far off.' 







###### 28 



Therefore say to them, 'This is what the Lord God says: "None of My words will be delayed any longer. Whatever word I speak will be performed,"'" declares the Lord God. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Ezekiel 17

***








###### 1 



Now the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 







###### 2 



"Son of man, ask a riddle and present a parable to the house of Israel, 







###### 3 



[^a]saying, 'This is what the Lord [^b]God says: "A great [^c]eagle with great wings, long pinions, and a full plumage of many colors came to [^d]Lebanon and took away the top of the [^e]cedar. 







###### 4 



He broke off the [^f]topmost of its young twigs and brought it to a land of merchants; he set it in a [^g]city of traders. 







###### 5 



He also took [^h]from the seed of the land and planted [^i]it in [^j]fertile soil, a [^k]meadow beside abundant waters; he set it _like_ a willow. 







###### 6 



Then it sprouted and became a low, spreading vine with its branches turned toward him, but its roots remained under it. So it became a vine and produced shoots and sent out branches. 







###### 7 



"But there was [^l]another great eagle with great wings and much plumage; and behold, this vine turned its roots toward him and sent out its branches toward him from the beds where it was planted, so that he might water it. 







###### 8 



It was planted in good [^m]soil beside abundant waters, so that it would produce branches and bear fruit, _and_ become a splendid vine."' 







###### 9 



Say, 'This is what the Lord God says: "Will it thrive? Will he not pull up its roots and cut off its fruit, so that it withers--so that all its sprouting shoots wither? And neither by great [^n]strength nor by many people can it be raised from its roots _again_. 







###### 10 



Behold, though it is planted, will it thrive? Will it not completely wither as soon as the east wind strikes it--wither on the beds where it grew?"'" ## Zedekiah's Rebellion 







###### 11 



Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 







###### 12 



"Say now to the rebellious house, 'Do you not know what these things _mean_?' Say, 'Behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, took its king and leaders, and brought them to him in Babylon. 







###### 13 



Then he took one of the royal [^o]family and made a covenant with him, [^p]putting him under oath. He also took away the mighty of the land, 







###### 14 



so that the kingdom would be humbled, not exalting itself, _but_ keeping his covenant so that it might continue. 







###### 15 



But [^q]he revolted against [^r]him by sending his messengers to Egypt so that they might give him horses and many [^s]troops. Will he succeed? Will he who does these things escape? Can he indeed break the covenant and escape? 







###### 16 



As I live,' declares the Lord God, 'In the [^t]country of the king who [^u]put him on the throne, whose oath he despised and whose covenant he broke, [^v]in Babylon he shall certainly die. 







###### 17 



Pharaoh with _his_ mighty army and great contingent will not [^w]help him in the war, when they pile up assault ramps and build siege walls to eliminate many lives. 







###### 18 



Now he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, and behold, he [^x]pledged his allegiance, yet did all these things; he shall not escape.'" 







###### 19 



Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: "As I live, My oath which he despised and My covenant which he broke, I will certainly [^y]inflict on his head. 







###### 20 



And I will spread My net over him, and he will be caught in My net. Then I will bring him to Babylon and enter into judgment with him there _regarding_ the unfaithful act which he has committed against Me. 







###### 21 



All the [^z]choice men in all his troops will fall by the sword, and the survivors will be scattered to every wind; and you will know that I, the LORD, have spoken." 







###### 22 



This is what the Lord God says: "I will also take _a sprig_ from the lofty top of the cedar and [^aa]set _it_ out; I will break off from the topmost of its young twigs a tender one, and I will plant _it_ on a high and lofty mountain. 







###### 23 



On the high mountain of Israel I will plant it, so that it may bring forth branches and bear fruit, and become a stately cedar. And [^ab]birds of every [^ac]kind will [^ad]nest under it; they will [^ae]nest in the shade of its branches. 







###### 24 



All the trees of the field will know that I am the LORD; I bring down the high tree, exalt the low tree, dry up the green tree, and make the dry tree flourish. I am the LORD; I have spoken, and I will perform _it_." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

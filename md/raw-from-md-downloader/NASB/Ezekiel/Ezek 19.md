# Ezekiel 19

***








###### 1 



"As for you, take up a song of mourning for the leaders of Israel 







###### 2 



and say, '[^a]What was your mother? A lioness among lions! She lay down among young lions, She raised her cubs. 







###### 3 



When she brought up one of her cubs, He became a young lion, And he learned to tear _his_ prey; He devoured people. 







###### 4 



Then nations heard about him; He was caught in their trap, And they brought him with hooks To the land of Egypt. 







###### 5 



When she saw, as she waited, _That_ her hope was lost, She took [^b]another of her cubs _And_ made him a young lion. 







###### 6 



And he walked about among the lions, He became a young lion; He learned to tear _his_ prey; He devoured people. 







###### 7 



He [^c]destroyed their [^d]palaces And laid waste their cities; And the land and its fullness were appalled Because of the sound of his roaring. 







###### 8 



Then nations set against him On every side from _their_ provinces, And they spread their net over him; He was caught in their trap. 







###### 9 



They put him in a [^e]wooden collar with hooks And brought him to the king of Babylon; They brought him in hunting nets So that his voice would no longer be heard On the mountains of Israel. 







###### 10 



Your mother was like a vine in your [^f]vineyard, Planted by the waters; It was fruitful and thick with branches Because of abundant waters. 







###### 11 



And it had [^g]strong stems _fit_ for scepters of rulers, And its height was raised above the clouds So that it was seen in its height with the mass of its branches. 







###### 12 



But it was uprooted in fury; It was thrown down to the ground; And the east wind dried up its fruit. [^h]Its strong stem [^i]was torn out So that [^j]it withered; The fire consumed it. 







###### 13 



And now it is planted in the wilderness, In a dry and thirsty land. 







###### 14 



And fire has gone out from _its_ stem; It has consumed its shoots _and_ fruit, So that there is no [^k]strong stem in it, A scepter to rule.'" This is a song of mourning, and has become a song of mourning. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

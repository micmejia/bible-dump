# Ezekiel 2

***








###### 1 



Then He said to me, "Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak with you." 







###### 2 



And as He spoke to me the Spirit entered me and set me on my feet; and I heard _Him_ speaking to me. 







###### 3 



Then He said to me, "Son of man, I am sending you to the sons of Israel, to a rebellious people who have rebelled against Me; they and their fathers have revolted against Me to this very day. 







###### 4 



So I am sending you to those who are [^a]impudent and obstinate children, and you shall say to them, 'This is what the Lord [^b]God says:' 







###### 5 



As for them, whether they listen or [^c]not--for they are a rebellious house--they will know that a prophet has been among them. 







###### 6 



And as for you, son of man, you are not to fear them nor fear their words, though thistles and thorns are with you and you sit on scorpions; you are not to fear their words nor be dismayed at their presence, since they are a rebellious house. 







###### 7 



But you shall speak My words to them whether they listen or [^d]not, for they are rebellious. 







###### 8 



"Now you, son of man, listen to what I am speaking to you; do not be rebellious like that rebellious house. Open your mouth wide and eat what I am giving you." 







###### 9 



Then I looked, and behold, a hand was extended to me; and behold, a [^e]scroll _was_ in it. 







###### 10 



When He spread it out before me, it was written on the front and back, and written on it were songs of mourning, sighing, and woe. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

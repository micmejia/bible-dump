# Ezekiel 21

***








###### 1 



[^a]And the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 







###### 2 



"Son of man, set your face against Jerusalem, and [^b]speak prophetically against the sanctuaries and prophesy against the land of Israel; 







###### 3 



and say to the land of Israel, 'This is what the LORD says: "Behold, I am against you; and I will draw My sword from its sheath and cut off from you the righteous and the wicked. 







###### 4 



Because I will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked, therefore My sword will go out from its sheath against [^c]humanity from south _to_ north. 







###### 5 



So [^d]humanity will know that I, the LORD, have drawn My sword from its sheath. It will not return _to its sheath_ again."' 







###### 6 



As for you, son of man, groan with [^e]a breaking heart and bitter grief; you shall groan in their sight. 







###### 7 



And when they say to you, 'Why are you groaning?' you shall say, 'Because of the news, for it is coming; and every heart will melt, all hands will go limp, every spirit will be disheartened, and all [^f]knees will drip with water. Behold, it is coming and it will happen,' declares the Lord [^g]God." 







###### 8 



And the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 







###### 9 



"Son of man, prophesy and say, 'This is what the LORD says:' Say, 'A sword, a sword sharpened And also polished! 







###### 10 



Sharpened to make a slaughter, Polished [^h]to flash like lightning!' Or shall we rejoice, the [^i]rod of My son despising every tree? 







###### 11 



And it is given to be polished, so that it may be handled; the sword is sharpened and polished, to hand it over to the slaughterer. 







###### 12 



Cry out and wail, son of man; for it is against My people, it is against all the officials of Israel. They are turned over to the sword with My people, therefore [^j]slap _your_ thigh. 







###### 13 



For _there is_ a testing; and what if even the [^k]rod which despises will cease to be?" declares the Lord God. 







###### 14 



"You therefore, son of man, prophesy and clap _your_ hands; and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword for the slain. It is the sword for the great one slain, which surrounds them, 







###### 15 



so that _their_ hearts will waver, and many fall at all their gates. I have granted the slaughter of the sword. Oh! It is made for _striking like_ lightning, it is sharpened _in readiness_ for slaughter. 







###### 16 



Prove yourself sharp, go to the right; set yourself; go to the left, wherever your [^l]edge is ordered. 







###### 17 



I will also clap My hands, and I will satisfy My wrath; I, the LORD, have spoken." ## The Instrument of God's Judgment 







###### 18 



And the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 







###### 19 



"Now as for you, son of man, [^m]make two ways for the sword of the king of Babylon to come; both of them will go out of one land. And [^n]make a signpost; [^o]make it at the head of the way to the city. 







###### 20 



You shall [^p]mark a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and to Judah into fortified Jerusalem. 







###### 21 



For the king of Babylon stands at the [^q]parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination; he shakes the arrows, he consults the [^r]household idols, he looks at the liver. 







###### 22 



Into his right hand came the divination, 'Jerusalem,' to set up battering rams, to open the mouth [^s]for [^t]slaughter, to raise the voice with a battle cry, to set up battering rams against the gates, to pile up assault ramps, to build a siege wall. 







###### 23 



And it will be to them like a false divination in their eyes; they have _sworn_ solemn oaths. But he makes guilt known, so that they may be seized. 







###### 24 



"Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: 'Because you have made your guilt known, in that your offenses are uncovered, so that in all your deeds your sins are seen--because you have come to mind, you will be seized by the hand. 







###### 25 



And you, slain, wicked one, the prince of Israel, whose day has come, in the time of the [^u]punishment of the end,' 







###### 26 



this is what the Lord God says: 'Remove the [^v]turban and take off the crown; this _will_ [^w]no _longer be_ the same. Exalt that which is low, and humble that which is high. 







###### 27 



Ruins, ruins, ruins, I will make it! This also will be no _longer_ until He comes whose right it is, and I will give it _to Him_.' 







###### 28 



"And you, son of man, prophesy and say, 'This is what the Lord God says concerning the sons of Ammon and their taunting,' and say: 'A sword, a sword is drawn, sharpened for the slaughter, to make it [^x]consume, so that _it may be like_ lightning-- 







###### 29 



while they see false visions for you, while they divine lies for you--to place you on the necks of the wicked who are killed, whose day has come, in the time of the [^y]punishment of the end. 







###### 30 



Return _it_ to its sheath. In the place where you were created, in the land of your origin, I will judge you. 







###### 31 



I will pour out My indignation on you; I will blow on you with the fire of My wrath, and I will hand you over to brutal men, craftsmen of destruction. 







###### 32 



You will be [^z]fuel for the fire; your blood will be in the midst of the land. You will not be remembered, for I, the LORD, have spoken.'" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

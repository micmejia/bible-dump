# Ezekiel 24

***








###### 1 



Now the word of the LORD came to me in the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth of the month, saying, 







###### 2 



"Son of man, write the name of the day, this very day. The king of Babylon [^a]has laid siege to Jerusalem this very day. 







###### 3 



Present a parable to the rebellious house and say to them, 'This is what the Lord [^b]God says: "Put on the pot, put _it_ on and also pour water into it; 







###### 4 



[^c]Put in it the pieces of meat, Every good piece, the thigh and the shoulder; Fill _it_ with choice bones. 







###### 5 



Take the choicest of the flock, And also stack [^d]wood under [^e]the pot. Make it boil vigorously. Also boil its bones in it." 







###### 6 



'Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: "Woe to the bloody city, To the pot in which there is rust And whose rust has not gone out of it! Take out of it piece after piece, [^f]Without making a choice. 







###### 7 



For her blood is in her midst; She placed it on the bare rock; She did not pour it on the ground To cover it with dust. 







###### 8 



So that it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance, I have put her blood on the bare rock, So that it will not be covered." 







###### 9 



Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: "Woe to the bloody city! I also will make the wood pile great. 







###### 10 



Heap on the wood, kindle the fire, [^g]Cook the meat thoroughly And mix in the spices, And let the bones be burned up. 







###### 11 



Then set it empty on its burning coals So that it may be hot And its bronze may [^h]glow, And its filthiness may be melted in it, Its rust eliminated. 







###### 12 



She has wearied _Me_ with work, Yet her great rust has not gone from her; _Let_ her rust _be_ in the fire! 







###### 13 



In your filthiness is outrageous sin. Because I _would_ have cleansed you, Yet you are not clean, You will not be cleansed from your filthiness again Until I have [^i]expended My wrath on you. 







###### 14 



I, the LORD, have spoken; it is coming and I will act. I will not overlook, I will not pity, and I will not be sorry; according to your ways and according to your deeds [^j]I will judge you," declares the Lord God.'" ## Death of Ezekiel's Wife Is a Sign 







###### 15 



And the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 







###### 16 



"Son of man, behold, I am about to take from you what is precious to your eyes with a fatal blow; but you shall not mourn and you shall not weep, and your tears shall not come. 







###### 17 



Groan silently; do no mourning for the dead. Bind on your turban and put your sandals on your feet, and do not [^k]cover _your_ mustache, and do not eat the [^l]bread of _other_ people." 







###### 18 



So I spoke to the people in the morning, and in the evening my wife died. And in the morning I did as I was commanded. 







###### 19 



And the people said to me, "Will you not tell us what these things _mean_ for us, that you are doing?" 







###### 20 



Then I said to them, "The word of the LORD came to me, saying, 







###### 21 



'Speak to the house of Israel, "This is what the Lord God says: 'Behold, I am about to profane My sanctuary, the pride of your power, that which is precious in your eyes and the longing of your soul; and your sons and your daughters whom you have left behind will fall by the sword. 







###### 22 



And you will do just as I have done; you will not [^m]cover _your_ mustache, and you will not eat the [^n]bread of _other_ people. 







###### 23 



Your turbans will be on your heads, and your sandals on your feet. You will not mourn and you will not weep; but you will rot away in your guilty deeds, and you will groan [^o]to one another. 







###### 24 



So Ezekiel will be a sign to you; according to all that he has done, you will do. When it comes, then you will know that I am the Lord God.'" 







###### 25 



'As for you, son of man, will _it_ not be on the day when I take from them their stronghold, the joy of their splendor, that which is precious in their eyes and their [^p]heart's longing, their sons and their daughters, 







###### 26 



that on that day the one who escapes will come to you with information for _your_ ears? 







###### 27 



On that day your mouth will be opened to him who escaped, and you will speak and no longer be silenced. So you will be a sign to them, and they will know that I am the LORD.'" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

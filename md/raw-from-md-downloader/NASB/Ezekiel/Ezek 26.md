# Ezekiel 26

***








###### 1 



Now in the eleventh year, on the first of the month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 







###### 2 



"Son of man, because Tyre has said in regard to Jerusalem, 'Aha! The gateway of the peoples is broken; it has [^a]opened to me. I shall be filled, _now that_ she is laid waste,' 







###### 3 



therefore this is what the Lord [^b]God says: 'Behold, I am against you, Tyre, and I will bring up many nations against you, as the sea brings up its waves. 







###### 4 



They will destroy the walls of Tyre and tear down her towers; and I will sweep her debris away from her and make her a bare rock. 







###### 5 



She will become a dry place for _the spreading of_ nets in the midst of the sea, for I have spoken,' declares the Lord God; 'and she will become plunder for the nations. 







###### 6 



Also her daughters who are [^c]on the mainland will be killed by the sword, and they will know that I am the LORD.'" 







###### 7 



For the Lord God says this: "Behold, I am going to bring upon Tyre from the north Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, king of kings, with horses, chariots, cavalry, and [^d]a great army. 







###### 8 



He will kill your daughters [^e]on the mainland with the sword; and he will make siege walls against you, pile up an assault ramp against you, and raise up a large shield against you. 







###### 9 



And he will direct the blow of his battering rams against your walls, and he will tear down your towers with his [^f]axes. 







###### 10 



Because of the multitude of his horses, the dust _raised by_ them will cover you; your walls will shake from the noise of cavalry, [^g]wagons, and chariots when he enters your gates as _warriors_ enter a city that is breached. 







###### 11 



With the hoofs of his horses he will trample all your streets. He will kill your people with the sword, and your strong [^h]pillars will go down to the ground. 







###### 12 



Also they will take your riches as spoils and plunder your merchandise, tear down your walls and destroy your delightful houses, and [^i]throw your stones, your timbers, and your debris into the water. 







###### 13 



So I will put an end to the sound of your songs, and the sound of your harps will no longer be heard. 







###### 14 



I will turn you into a bare rock; you will become a dry place for _the spreading of_ nets. You will not be rebuilt, for I the LORD have spoken," declares the Lord God. 







###### 15 



The Lord God says this to Tyre: "Will the coastlands not shake from the sound of your downfall when the wounded groan, when the slaughter takes place in your midst? 







###### 16 



Then all the princes of the sea will descend from their thrones, remove their robes, and strip off their colorfully woven garments. They will clothe themselves with [^j]trembling; they will sit on the ground, tremble again and again, and be appalled at you. 







###### 17 



And they will take up a song of mourning over you and say to you, 'How you have perished, you inhabited one, From the seas, you famous city, Which was mighty on the sea, She and her inhabitants, Who imposed [^k]her terror On all her inhabitants! 







###### 18 



Now the coastlands will tremble On the day of your downfall; Yes, the coastlands which are by the sea Will be horrified at your passing.'" 







###### 19 



For this is what the Lord God says: "When I make you a desolate city, like the cities which are not inhabited, when I bring up the deep over you and the great waters cover you, 







###### 20 



then I will bring you down with those who go down to the pit, to the people of old, and I will make you remain in the lower parts of the earth, like the ancient ruins, with those who go down to the pit, so that you will not [^l]be inhabited; but I will put glory in the land of the living. 







###### 21 



I will [^m]cause you sudden terrors and you will no longer exist; though you will be sought, you will never be found again," declares the Lord God. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Ezekiel 29

***








###### 1 



In the tenth year, in the tenth _month_, on the twelfth of the month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 







###### 2 



"Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him and against all Egypt. 







###### 3 



Speak and say, 'This is what the Lord [^a]God says: "Behold, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, The great [^b]monster that lies in the midst of his [^c]canals, That has said, 'My Nile is mine, and I myself have made _it_.' 







###### 4 



I will put hooks in your jaws And make the fish of your [^d]canals cling to your scales. And I will bring you up out of the midst of your [^e]canals, And all the fish of your [^f]canals will cling to your scales. 







###### 5 



I will abandon you to the wilderness, you and all the fish of your [^g]canals; You will fall on the [^h]open field; you will not be brought together or [^i]gathered. I have given you for food to the animals of the earth and to the birds of the sky. 







###### 6 



Then all the inhabitants of Egypt will know that I am the LORD, Because they have been _only_ a staff _made_ of reed to the house of Israel. 







###### 7 



When they took hold of you with the hand, You broke and tore all their [^j]hands; And when they leaned on you, You broke and made all their hips [^k]shake." 







###### 8 



'Therefore the Lord God says this: "Behold, I am going to bring upon you a sword, and I will cut off from you human and animal _life_. 







###### 9 



The land of Egypt will become a desolation and place of ruins. Then they will know that I am the LORD. "Because [^l]you said, 'The Nile is mine, and I have made _it_,' 







###### 10 



therefore, behold, I am against you and against your [^m]canals, and I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste _and_ desolation, from Migdol _to_ Syene and as far as the border of [^n]Cush. 







###### 11 



A human foot will not pass through it, nor will the foot of an animal pass through it, and it will not be inhabited for forty years. 







###### 12 



So I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst of deserted lands. And her cities, in the midst of cities that are laid waste, will be desolate for forty years; and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them among the lands." 







###### 13 



'For this is what the Lord God says: "At the end of forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the peoples [^o]among whom they were scattered. 







###### 14 



And I will restore the fortunes of Egypt and bring them back to the land of Pathros, to the land of their origin, and there they will be a lowly kingdom. 







###### 15 



It will be the lowest of the kingdoms, and it will not raise itself above the nations again. And I will make them small so that they will not rule over the nations. 







###### 16 



And it will no longer be _a kingdom_ on which the house of Israel relies, [^p]bringing to mind the guilt of their having turned [^q]to Egypt. Then they will know that I am the Lord God."'" 







###### 17 



Now in the twenty-seventh year, in the first _month_, on the first of the month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 







###### 18 



"Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made his army labor [^r]hard against Tyre; every head [^s]had a bald spot and every shoulder was rubbed raw. But he and his army acquired no wages from Tyre for the labor that he had [^t]performed against it." 







###### 19 



Therefore this is what the Lord God says: "Behold, I am going to give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. And he will carry off her wealth and capture her spoils and seize her plunder; and it will be wages for his army. 







###### 20 



I have given him the land of Egypt _for_ his labor which he [^u]performed, because they acted for Me," declares the Lord God. 







###### 21 



"On that day I will make a horn sprout for the house of Israel, and I will [^v]open your mouth among them. Then they will know that I am the LORD." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

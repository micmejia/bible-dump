# Ezekiel 30

***








###### 1 



The word of the LORD came again to me, saying, 







###### 2 



"Son of man, prophesy and say, 'This is what the Lord [^a]God says: "Wail, 'Woe for the day!' 







###### 3 



For the day is near, Indeed, the day of the LORD is near; It will be a day of clouds, A time _of doom_ for the nations. 







###### 4 



A sword will come upon Egypt, And there will be trembling in [^b]Cush; When the slain fall in Egypt, They will take away her [^c]wealth, And her foundations will be torn down. 







###### 5 



[^d]Cush, Put, Lud, all [^e]Arabia, [^f]Libya and the [^g]people of the land [^h]that is in league will fall with them by the sword." 







###### 6 



'This is what the LORD says: "Indeed, those who support Egypt will fall And the pride of her power will come down; From Migdol _to_ Syene They will fall within her by the sword," Declares the Lord God. 







###### 7 



"They will be desolate In the midst of the desolated lands; And her cities will be In the midst of the devastated cities. 







###### 8 



And they will know that I am the LORD, When I set a fire in Egypt And all her helpers are broken. 







###### 9 



On that day messengers will go out from Me in ships to frighten carefree [^i]Cush; and trembling will come on them _as_ on the day of Egypt; for behold, it is coming!" 







###### 10 



'This is what the Lord God says: "I will also make the [^j]hordes of Egypt cease By the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. 







###### 11 



He and his people with him, The most ruthless of the nations, Will be brought in to destroy the land; And they will draw their swords against Egypt And fill the land with the slain. 







###### 12 



Moreover, I will make the Nile canals dry And sell the land into the hands of evil men. And I will make the land desolate And [^k]all that is in it, By the hand of strangers; I the LORD have spoken." 







###### 13 



'This is what the Lord God says: "I will also destroy the idols And make the [^l]images cease from [^m]Memphis. And there will no longer be a prince in the land of Egypt; And I will put fear in the land of Egypt. 







###### 14 



I will make Pathros desolate, Set a fire in Zoan And execute judgments on [^n]Thebes. 







###### 15 



I will pour out My wrath on [^o]Sin, The stronghold of Egypt; I will also eliminate the hordes of [^p]Thebes. 







###### 16 



I will set a fire in Egypt; [^q]Sin will writhe in anguish, [^r]Thebes will be breached And [^s]Memphis _will have_ [^t]distresses daily. 







###### 17 



The young men of [^u]On and of Pi-beseth Will fall by the sword, And [^v]the women will go into captivity. 







###### 18 



In Tehaphnehes the day will [^w]be dark When I break there the yoke bars of Egypt. Then the pride of her power will cease in her; A cloud will cover her, And her daughters will go into captivity. 







###### 19 



So I will execute judgments on Egypt, And they will know that I am the LORD."'" ## Victory for Babylon 







###### 20 



In the eleventh year, in the first _month_, on the seventh of the month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 







###### 21 



"Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and, behold, it has not been bound up [^x]for healing [^y]or wrapped with a bandage, so that it may be strong to wield the sword. 







###### 22 



Therefore this is what the Lord God says: 'Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and I will break his arms, both the strong and the broken; and I will make the sword fall from his hand. 







###### 23 



And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them among the lands. 







###### 24 



For I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon and put My sword in his hand; and I will break the arms of Pharaoh, so that he will groan before him with the groans of a wounded man. 







###### 25 



So I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, but the arms of Pharaoh will fail. Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I put My sword into the hand of the king of Babylon and he reaches out with it against the land of Egypt. 







###### 26 



When I scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them among the lands, then they will know that I am the LORD.'" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

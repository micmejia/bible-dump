# Ezekiel 37

***








###### 1 



The hand of the LORD was upon me, and He brought me out [^a]by the Spirit of the LORD and set me down in the middle of the valley; and it was full of bones. 







###### 2 



He had me pass among them all around, and behold, _there were_ very many on the surface of the valley; and behold, _they were_ very dry. 







###### 3 



Then He said to me, "Son of man, can these bones live?" And I answered, "Lord [^b]God, You Yourself know." 







###### 4 



Again He said to me, "Prophesy over these bones and say to them, 'You dry bones, hear the word of the LORD.' 







###### 5 



This is what the Lord God says to these bones: 'Behold, I am going to make [^c]breath enter you so that you may come to life. 







###### 6 



And I will [^d]attach tendons to you, make flesh grow back on you, cover you with skin, and put breath in you so that you may come to life; and you will know that I am the LORD.'" 







###### 7 



So I prophesied as I was commanded; and as I prophesied, there was a _loud_ noise, and behold, a [^e]rattling; and the bones came together, bone to its bone. 







###### 8 



And I looked, and behold, tendons were on them, and flesh grew and skin covered them; but there was no breath in them. 







###### 9 



Then He said to me, "Prophesy to the breath, prophesy, son of man, and say to the breath, 'The Lord God says this: "Come from the four winds, breath, and breathe on these slain, so that they come to life."'" 







###### 10 



So I prophesied as He commanded me, and the breath entered them, and they came to life and stood on their feet, an exceedingly great army. ## The Vision Explained 







###### 11 



Then He said to me, "Son of man, these bones are the entire house of Israel; behold, they say, 'Our bones are dried up and our hope has perished. We are [^f]completely cut off.' 







###### 12 



Therefore prophesy and say to them, 'This is what the Lord God says: "Behold, I am going to open your graves and cause you to come up out of your graves, My people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel. 







###### 13 



Then you will know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your graves and caused you to come up out of your graves, My people. 







###### 14 



And I will put My [^g]Spirit within you and you will come to life, and I will place you on your own land. Then you will know that I, the LORD, have spoken and done it," declares the LORD.'" ## Reunion of Judah and Israel 







###### 15 



The word of the LORD came again to me, saying, 







###### 16 



"Now you, son of man, take for yourself one stick and write on it, 'For Judah and for the sons of Israel, his companions'; then take another stick and write on it, 'For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim and all the house of Israel, his companions.' 







###### 17 



Then put them together for yourself one to another into one stick, so that they may become one in your hand. 







###### 18 



And when the sons of your people speak to you, saying, 'Will you not declare to us what [^h]you mean by these?' 







###### 19 



say to them, 'This is what the Lord God says: "Behold, I am going to take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel, his companions; and I will put them with it, with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they will be one in My hand."' 







###### 20 



The sticks on which you write will be in your hand before their eyes. 







###### 21 



And say to them, 'This is what the Lord God says: "Behold, I am going to take the sons of Israel from among the nations where they have gone, and I will gather them from every side and bring them into their own land; 







###### 22 



and I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel; and one king will be king for all of them; and they will no longer be two nations, and no longer be divided into two kingdoms. 







###### 23 



They will no longer defile themselves with their idols, or with their detestable things, or with any of their offenses; but I will rescue them from all their [^i]dwelling places in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them. And they will be My people, and I will be their God. ## The Davidic Kingdom 







###### 24 



"And My servant David will be king over them, and they will all have one shepherd; and they will walk in My ordinances, and keep My statutes and [^j]follow them. 







###### 25 



And they will live on the land that I gave to My servant Jacob, in which your fathers lived; and they will live on it, they, and their sons and their sons' sons, forever; and My servant David will be their leader forever. 







###### 26 



And I will make a covenant of peace with them; it will be an everlasting covenant with them. And I will [^k]place them and multiply them, and set My sanctuary in their midst forever. 







###### 27 



My dwelling place also will be among them; and I will be their God, and they will be My people. 







###### 28 



And the nations will know that I am the LORD who sanctifies Israel, when My sanctuary is in their midst forever."'" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

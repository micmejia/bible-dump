# Ezekiel 40

***








###### 1 



In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was [^a]taken, on this very day the hand of the LORD was upon me and He brought me there. 







###### 2 



In the visions of God He brought me into the land of Israel and set me on a very high mountain, and on it to the south _there was something_ like a structure of a city. 







###### 3 



So He brought me there; and behold, there was a man whose appearance was like the appearance of bronze, with a thread of flax and a measuring [^b]rod in his hand; and he was standing in the gateway. 







###### 4 



And the man said to me, "Son of man, see with your eyes, hear with your ears, and [^c]pay attention to all that I am going to show you; for you have been brought here in order to show _it_ to you. Declare to the house of Israel all that you see." ## Measurements Relating to the Temple 







###### 5 



And behold, there was a wall on the outside of the [^d]temple all around, and in the man's hand was a measuring rod of six [^e]cubits, [^f]each of which was a [^g]cubit and a hand width. So he measured the thickness of the [^h]wall, one rod; and the height, one rod. 







###### 6 



Then he went to the gate which faced east, went up its steps, and measured the threshold of the gate, one rod [^i]in width; and the other threshold _was_ one rod [^j]in width. 







###### 7 



The guardroom _was_ one rod long and one rod wide; and _there were_ five cubits between the guardrooms. And the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate [^k]facing inward _was_ one rod. 







###### 8 



Then he measured the porch of the gate [^l]facing inward, one rod. 







###### 9 



And he measured the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and its side pillars, two cubits. And the porch of the gate was [^m]faced inward. 







###### 10 



The guardrooms of the gate toward the east _numbered_ three on each side; the three of them had the same measurement. The side pillars also had the same measurement on each side. 







###### 11 



And he measured the width of the [^n]gateway, ten cubits, _and_ the length of the gate, thirteen cubits. 







###### 12 



_There was_ a [^o]barrier _wall_ one cubit _wide_ in front of the guardrooms on each side; and the guardrooms _were_ six cubits _square_ on each side. 







###### 13 



And he measured the gate from the roof of the one guardroom to the roof of the other, a width of twenty-five cubits, from _one_ door to _the_ door opposite. 







###### 14 



He made the side pillars sixty cubits _high_; the gate _extended_ all around to the side pillar of the courtyard. 







###### 15 



And _from_ the front of the entrance gate to the front of the inner porch of the gate _was_ fifty cubits. 







###### 16 



And _there were_ [^p]shuttered windows _looking_ toward the guardrooms, and toward their side pillars within the gate all around, and likewise for the porches. And _there were_ windows all around inside; and on _each_ side pillar _were_ palm tree decorations. 







###### 17 



Then he brought me into the outer courtyard, and behold, _there were_ chambers and a stone pavement made for the courtyard all around; thirty chambers [^q]faced the pavement. 







###### 18 



And the pavement (_that is_, the lower pavement) _was_ by the [^r]side of the gates, corresponding to the length of the gates. 







###### 19 



Then he measured the width from the front of the lower gate to the front of the exterior of the inner courtyard, a hundred cubits on the east and on the north. 







###### 20 



And _as for_ the gate of the outer courtyard which faced north, he measured its length and its width. 







###### 21 



[^s]It had three guardrooms on each side; and its side pillars and its porches [^t]had the same measurement as the first gate. Its length _was_ fifty cubits, and the width twenty-five cubits. 







###### 22 



Its windows, its porches, and its palm tree decorations _had_ the same measurements as the gate which faced east; and [^u]it was reached by seven steps, and its [^v]porch _was_ in front of them. 







###### 23 



The inner courtyard had a gate opposite the gate on the north as well as _the gate_ on the east; and he measured a hundred cubits from gate to gate. 







###### 24 



Then he led me toward the south, and behold, there was a gate toward the south; and he measured its side pillars and its porches according to [^w]those same measurements. 







###### 25 



[^x]The gate and its porches had windows all around like [^y]those other windows; the length _was_ fifty cubits and the width, twenty-five cubits. 







###### 26 



_There were_ seven steps going up to it, and its porches _were_ in front of them; and it had palm tree decorations on its side pillars, one on each side. 







###### 27 



The inner courtyard had a gate toward the south; and he measured from gate to gate toward the south, a hundred cubits. 







###### 28 



Then he brought me to the inner courtyard by the south gate; and he measured the south gate according to those same measurements. 







###### 29 



Its guardrooms also, its side pillars, and its porches _were_ according to those same measurements. And [^z]the gate and its porches had windows all around; it _was_ fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. 







###### 30 



_There were_ porches all around, twenty-five cubits long and five cubits wide. 







###### 31 



And its porches _were_ toward the outer courtyard; and palm tree decorations _were_ on its side pillars, and its stairway _had_ eight steps. 







###### 32 



Then he brought me into the inner courtyard toward the east. And he measured the gate according to those same measurements. 







###### 33 



Its guardrooms also, its side pillars, and its porches _were_ according to those same measurements. And [^aa]the gate and its porches had windows all around; it _was_ fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. 







###### 34 



Its porches _were_ toward the outer courtyard; and palm tree decorations _were_ on its side pillars, on each side, and its stairway _had_ eight steps. 







###### 35 



Then he brought me to the north gate; and he measured _it_ according to those same measurements, 







###### 36 



_with_ its guardrooms, its side pillars, and its porches. And [^ab]the gate had windows all around; the length _was_ fifty cubits and the width twenty-five cubits. 







###### 37 



And its side pillars _were_ toward the outer courtyard; and palm tree decorations _were_ on its side pillars, on each side, and its stairway had eight steps. 







###### 38 



A chamber with its doorway was by the side pillars at the gates; there they rinse the burnt offering. 







###### 39 



And in the porch of the gate _were_ two tables on each side, on which to slaughter the burnt offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering. 







###### 40 



On the outer [^ac]side, [^ad]as one went up to the [^ae]gateway toward the north, _were_ two tables; and on the other [^af]side of the porch of the gate _were_ two tables. 







###### 41 



Four tables _were_ on each side [^ag]next to the gate; eight tables on which they slaughter _sacrifices_. 







###### 42 



For the burnt offering _there were_ four tables of cut stone, a cubit and a half long, a cubit and a half wide, and one cubit high, on which they set the utensils with which they slaughter the burnt offering and the sacrifice. 







###### 43 



And the double [^ah]hooks, [^ai]one hand width _in length_, were installed [^aj]in the house all around; and on the tables _was_ the flesh of the offering. 







###### 44 



From the outside to the inner gate were [^ak]chambers for the singers in the inner courtyard, _one of_ which was at the [^al]side of the north gate, with [^am]its front toward the south, _and_ one at the [^an]side of the [^ao]south gate facing north. 







###### 45 



Then he said to me, "This is the chamber which faces south, _intended_ for the priests who [^ap]are responsible for the [^aq]temple; 







###### 46 



but the chamber which faces north is for the priests who [^ar]are responsible for the altar. They are the sons of Zadok, who from the sons of Levi come near to the LORD to serve Him." 







###### 47 



He measured the courtyard, a _perfect_ square, a hundred cubits long and a hundred cubits wide; and the altar was in front of the [^as]temple. 







###### 48 



Then he brought me to the porch of the [^at]temple and measured _each_ side pillar of the porch, five cubits on each side; and the width of the gate was three cubits on each side. 







###### 49 



The length of the porch _was_ twenty cubits, and the width eleven cubits; and at the stairway by which it was ascended _were_ columns _belonging_ to the side pillars, one on each side. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

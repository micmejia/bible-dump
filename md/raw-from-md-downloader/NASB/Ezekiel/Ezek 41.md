# Ezekiel 41

***








###### 1 



Then he brought me to the sanctuary, and he measured the side pillars: six [^a]cubits wide on each side _was_ the width of the [^b]side pillar. 







###### 2 



The width of the entrance _was_ ten cubits and the [^c]sides of the entrance _were_ five cubits on each side. He also measured [^d]the length of the sanctuary, forty cubits, and the width, twenty cubits. 







###### 3 



Then he went [^e]inside and measured _each_ side pillar of the doorway, two cubits, and the doorway, six cubits _high_; and the width of the doorway, seven cubits. 







###### 4 



And he measured its length, twenty cubits, and the width, twenty cubits, before the sanctuary; and he said to me, "This is the Most Holy Place." 







###### 5 



Then he measured the wall of the [^f]temple, six cubits; and the width of the side chambers, four cubits, all around the house on every side. 







###### 6 



The side chambers were in three _stories_, [^g]one above another, and [^h]thirty in each story; and [^i]the side chambers extended to the wall which _stood_ on [^j]their inward side all around, so that they could be attached, but not be attached to the wall of the temple _itself_. 







###### 7 



And the side chambers surrounding _the temple_ were wider at each successive story. Because the structure surrounding the temple _went_ upward by stages on all sides of the temple, for that reason the width of the temple _increased_ as it went higher; and so one went up from the lowest _story_ to the highest by way of the [^k]second _story_. 







###### 8 



I saw also that the house had a raised [^l]platform all around; the foundations of the side chambers were a full [^m]rod of six [^n]long cubits _in height_. 







###### 9 



The [^o]thickness of the outer wall of the side chambers _was_ five cubits. But the free space between the side chambers belonging to the temple 







###### 10 



and the _outer_ chambers _was_ twenty cubits in width around the temple on every side. 







###### 11 



The [^p]doorways of the side [^q]chambers toward the free space _consisted of_ one doorway toward the north, and another doorway toward the south; and the width of the free space _was_ five cubits all around. 







###### 12 



The building that _was_ in front of the separate area at the side toward the west _was_ seventy cubits wide; and the wall of the building _was_ five cubits [^r]thick all around, and its length _was_ ninety cubits. 







###### 13 



Then he measured the temple, a hundred cubits long; the separate area with the building and its walls _were_ also a hundred cubits long. 







###### 14 



Also the width of the front of the temple and _that of_ the separate [^s]areas along the east _side totaled_ a hundred cubits. 







###### 15 



And he measured the length of the building [^t]along the front of the separate area behind it, with a [^u]gallery on each side, a hundred cubits; _he_ also _measured_ the inner sanctuary and the porches of the courtyard. 







###### 16 



The thresholds, the [^v]latticed windows, and the [^w]galleries all around their three _stories_, opposite the threshold, were paneled with wood all around, and _from_ the ground to the windows (but the windows were covered), 







###### 17 



over the entrance, and to the inner house, and on the outside, and on all the wall all around inside and outside, _by_ measurement. 







###### 18 



It was [^x]carved with cherubim and palm trees; and a palm tree was between cherub and cherub, and _every_ cherub had two faces: 







###### 19 



a human face toward the palm tree on one side and a young lion's face toward the palm tree on the other side; they were [^y]carved on all the house all around. 







###### 20 



From the ground to above the entrance cherubim and palm trees were [^z]carved, as well as _on_ the wall of the sanctuary. 







###### 21 



The doorposts of the sanctuary were square; as for the front of the _inner_ [^aa]sanctuary, the appearance _of one doorpost was_ like that _of the other_. 







###### 22 



The altar _was_ of wood, three cubits high, and its length two cubits; its corners, its [^ab]base, and its [^ac]sides _were_ of wood. And he said to me, "This is the table that is before the LORD." 







###### 23 



The sanctuary and the _inner_ [^ad]sanctuary _each_ had a double door. 







###### 24 



_Each of_ the doors had two leaves, two [^ae]swinging leaves; two _leaves_ for one door and two leaves for the other. 







###### 25 



Also there were [^af]carved on them, on the doors of the main room, cherubim and palm trees like those [^ag]carved on the walls; and _there was_ a [^ah]threshold of wood on the front of the porch outside. 







###### 26 



_And there were_ [^ai]latticed windows and palm trees on one side and on the other, on the sides of the porch; _the same were on_ the side chambers of the house and the [^aj]thresholds. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

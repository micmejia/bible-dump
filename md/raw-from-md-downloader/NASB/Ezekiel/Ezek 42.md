# Ezekiel 42

***








###### 1 



Then he brought me out into the outer courtyard, the way toward the north; and he brought me to the chamber which _was_ opposite the separate area and opposite the building toward the north. 







###### 2 



Along the length, _which was_ a hundred [^a]cubits, _was_ the north door; the width _was_ fifty cubits. 







###### 3 



Opposite the twenty _cubits_ which _belonged_ to the inner courtyard, and opposite the stone pavement which _belonged_ to the outer courtyard, _was_ [^b]gallery corresponding to [^c]gallery in three _stories_. 







###### 4 



In front of the chambers _was_ an inner passage ten cubits wide, a way of one _hundred_ cubits; and their openings _were_ on the north. 







###### 5 



Now the upper chambers _were_ [^d]smaller because the [^e]galleries took more _space_ away from them than from the lower and middle ones in the building. 







###### 6 



For they _were_ in three _stories_ and had no pillars like the pillars of the courtyards; for that reason _the upper chambers_ were [^f]set back from the ground _upward_, more than the lower and middle ones. 







###### 7 



As for the outer wall by the side of the chambers, toward the outer courtyard facing the chambers, its length _was_ fifty cubits. 







###### 8 



For the length of the chambers which _were_ in the outer courtyard _was_ fifty cubits; and behold, _the length of those_ facing the main room _was_ a hundred cubits. 







###### 9 



And below these chambers _was_ the entrance on the east side, as one enters them from the outer courtyard. 







###### 10 



In the [^g]thickness of the wall of the courtyard toward the east, facing the separate area and facing the building, _there were_ chambers. 







###### 11 



And the way in front of them _was_ like the appearance of the chambers which _were_ on the north; according to their length, so was their width, and all their exits _were_ according to their building plans and openings. 







###### 12 



Corresponding to the openings of the chambers which were toward the south was an opening at the head of the way, the way in front of the wall toward the east, as one enters them. 







###### 13 



Then he said to me, "The north chambers _and_ the south chambers, which are opposite the separate area, they are the holy chambers where the priests who are near to the LORD shall eat the most holy things. There they shall set the most holy things, the grain offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering; for the place is holy. 







###### 14 



When the priests enter, they shall not go out into the outer courtyard from the sanctuary [^h]without laying their garments there in which they minister, for they are holy. They shall put on other garments; then they shall approach that which is for the people." 







###### 15 



Now when he had finished measuring the inner house, he brought me out by way of the gate which faced east, and measured it all around. 







###### 16 



He measured on the east side with the measuring [^i]rod: five hundred rods by the measuring rod. 







###### 17 



He measured on the north side: five hundred rods by the measuring rod. 







###### 18 



On the south side he measured five hundred rods with the measuring rod. 







###### 19 



He turned to the west side _and_ measured five hundred rods with the measuring rod. 







###### 20 



He measured it [^j]on the four sides; it had a wall all around, the length five hundred _rods_ and the width five hundred, to divide between the holy and the [^k]common. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

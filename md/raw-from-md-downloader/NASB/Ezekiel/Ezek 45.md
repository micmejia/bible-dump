# Ezekiel 45

***








###### 1 



"Now when you divide the land by lot for inheritance, you shall offer [^a]an allotment to the LORD, a holy portion of the land; the length shall be a length of twenty-five thousand [^b]_cubits_, and the width shall be [^c]twenty thousand. It shall be holy within its entire surrounding boundary. 







###### 2 



Out of this there shall be for the sanctuary a square encompassing five hundred by five hundred _cubits_, and fifty cubits for its [^d]open space round about. 







###### 3 



From this [^e]area you shall measure a length of twenty-five thousand _cubits_ and a width of ten thousand _cubits_; and in it shall be the sanctuary, the Most Holy Place. 







###### 4 



It shall be the holy portion of the land; it shall be for the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary, who come near to serve the LORD, and it shall be a place for their houses and a holy place for the sanctuary. 







###### 5 



_An area_ twenty-five thousand _cubits_ in length and ten thousand in width shall be for the Levites, the ministers of the house, _and_ for their possession [^f]cities in which to live. 







###### 6 



"And you shall give the city possession of _an area_ five thousand _cubits_ wide and twenty-five thousand _cubits_ long, alongside the [^g]allotment of the holy portion; it shall be for the entire house of Israel. ## Portion for the Prince 







###### 7 



"And the prince shall have _land_ on either side of the holy [^h]allotment and the [^i]property of the city, adjacent to the holy [^j]allotment and the [^k]property of the city, on the west side toward the west and on the east side toward the east, and in length comparable to one of the portions, from the west border to the east border. 







###### 8 



_This_ shall be his land as a possession in Israel; so My princes shall no longer oppress My people, but they shall give _the rest of_ the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes." 







###### 9 



'This is what the Lord [^l]God says: "Enough, you princes of Israel; get rid of violence and destruction, and practice justice and righteousness. Revoke your evictions of My people," declares the Lord God. 







###### 10 



"You shall have accurate balances, an accurate [^m]ephah, and an accurate [^n]bath. 







###### 11 



The ephah and the bath shall be [^o]the same quantity, so that the bath will contain a tenth of a homer, and the ephah a tenth of a [^p]homer; [^q]their standard shall be according to the homer. 







###### 12 



And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs; twenty shekels, twenty-five shekels, _and_ fifteen shekels shall be your mina. 







###### 13 



"This is the offering that you shall offer: a sixth of an ephah from _each_ homer of wheat; a sixth of an ephah from _each_ homer of barley; 







###### 14 



and the prescribed portion of oil (_namely_, the bath of oil), a tenth of a bath from _each_ kor (_which is_ ten baths _or_ a homer, for ten baths are a homer); 







###### 15 



and one sheep from _each_ flock of two hundred from the watering places of Israel--for a grain offering, for a burnt offering, and for peace offerings, to make atonement for them," declares the Lord God. 







###### 16 



"All the people of the land shall [^r]give to this offering for the prince in Israel. 







###### 17 



And it shall be the prince's part _to provide_ the burnt offerings, the grain offerings, and the drink offerings, at the feasts, on the new moons, and on the Sabbaths, at all the appointed feasts of the house of Israel; he shall provide the sin offering, the grain offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offerings, to make atonement for the house of Israel." 







###### 18 



'This is what the Lord God says: "In the first _month_, on the first of the month, you shall take a [^s]bull without blemish and cleanse the sanctuary from sin. 







###### 19 



And the priest shall take some of the blood from the sin offering and put _it_ on the door posts of the house, on the four corners of the ledge of the altar, and on the posts of the gate of the inner courtyard. 







###### 20 



And you shall do this on the seventh _day_ of the month for everyone who does wrong inadvertently or is naive; so you shall make atonement for the house. 







###### 21 



"In the first _month_, on the fourteenth day of the month, you shall have the Passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten. 







###### 22 



On that day the prince shall provide for himself and all the people of the land a bull as a sin offering. 







###### 23 



And _during_ the seven days of the feast he shall provide as a burnt offering to the LORD seven bulls and seven rams without blemish on every day of the seven days, and a male goat daily as a sin offering. 







###### 24 



And he shall provide as a grain offering an [^t]ephah [^u]with a bull, an [^v]ephah [^w]with a ram, and a [^x]hin of oil [^y]with an ephah. 







###### 25 



In the seventh _month_, on the fifteenth day of the month, at the feast, he shall provide like these, seven days [^z]for the sin offering, the burnt offering, the grain offering, and the oil." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

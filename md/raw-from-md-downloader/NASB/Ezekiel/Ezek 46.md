# Ezekiel 46

***








###### 1 



'This is what the Lord [^a]God says: "The gate of the inner courtyard facing east shall be shut for the six working days; but it shall be opened on the Sabbath day and opened on the day of the new moon. 







###### 2 



The prince shall enter by way of the porch of the gate from outside and stand by the post of the gate. Then the priests shall provide his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate and _then_ go out; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening. 







###### 3 



The people of the land shall also worship at the doorway of that gate before the LORD on the Sabbaths and on the new moons. 







###### 4 



The burnt offering which the prince shall offer to the LORD on the Sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish and a ram without blemish; 







###### 5 



and the grain offering shall be an [^b]ephah [^c]with the ram, and the grain offering [^d]with the lambs [^e]as much as he is able to give, and a [^f]hin of oil [^g]with an ephah. 







###### 6 



On the day of the new moon _he shall offer_ a [^h]bull without blemish, and six lambs and a ram, _which_ shall be without blemish. 







###### 7 



And he shall provide a grain offering, an ephah [^i]with the bull and an ephah [^j]with the ram, and [^k]with the lambs as [^l]much as he is able, and a hin of oil [^m]with an ephah. 







###### 8 



When the prince enters, he shall go in by way of the porch of the gate, and go out by [^n]the same way. 







###### 9 



But when the people of the land come before the LORD at the appointed feasts, one who enters by way of the north gate to worship shall go out by way of the south gate. And one who enters by way of the south gate shall go out by way of the north gate. [^o]No one shall return by way of the gate by which he entered, but shall go straight out. 







###### 10 



And when they go in, the prince shall go in among them; and when they go out, [^p]he shall go out. 







###### 11 



"At the festivals and the appointed feasts, the grain offering shall be an ephah [^q]with a bull and an ephah [^r]with a ram, and [^s]with the lambs as [^t]much as one is able to give, and a hin of oil [^u]with an ephah. 







###### 12 



And when the prince provides a [^v]voluntary offering, a burnt offering, or peace offerings _as_ a [^w]voluntary offering to the LORD, the gate facing east shall be opened for him. And he shall provide his burnt offering and his peace offerings as he does on the Sabbath day. Then he shall go out, and the gate shall be shut after he goes out. 







###### 13 



"And you shall provide a lamb a year old without blemish as a burnt offering to the LORD daily; morning by morning you shall provide it. 







###### 14 



You shall also provide a grain offering with it morning by morning, a sixth of an ephah and a third of a hin of oil to moisten the fine flour, a grain offering to the LORD continually by [^x]a permanent ordinance. 







###### 15 



So they shall provide the lamb, the grain offering, and the oil, morning by morning, as a continual burnt offering." 







###### 16 



'This is what the Lord God says: "If the prince gives a gift _from_ his inheritance to any of his sons, it shall belong to his sons; it is their possession by inheritance. 







###### 17 



But if he gives a gift from his inheritance to one of his servants, it shall be his until the year of [^y]release; then it shall return to the prince. His inheritance _shall be_ only his sons'; it shall belong to them. 







###### 18 



And the prince shall not take from the people's inheritance, [^z]depriving them of their property; he shall give his sons inheritance from his own property, so that My people will not be scattered, anyone from his property."'" ## The Boiling Places 







###### 19 



Then he brought me through the entrance, which _was_ at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers for the priests, which faced north; and behold, a place was there at the extreme rear toward the west. 







###### 20 



And he said to me, "This is the place where the priests shall boil the guilt offering and the sin offering, _and_ where they shall bake the grain offering, so that they do not bring _them_ out into the outer courtyard [^aa]and transfer holiness to the people." 







###### 21 



Then he brought me out into the outer courtyard and led me across to the four corners of the courtyard; and behold, in every corner of the courtyard _there was_ a _small_ courtyard. 







###### 22 



In the four corners of the courtyard _there were_ enclosed courtyards, forty [^ab]_cubits_ long and thirty wide; these four in the corners _were_ [^ac]the same size. 







###### 23 



And _there was_ a row _of masonry_ all around in them, around the four of them, and cooking hearths were made under the rows all around. 







###### 24 



Then he said to me, "These are the cooking [^ad]places where the ministers of the house shall cook the sacrifices of the people." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

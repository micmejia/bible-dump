###### 1 



"Now these are the names of the tribes: from the northern extremity, [^a]beside the way of Hethlon to [^b]Lebo-hamath, _as far as_ Hazar-enan _at_ the border of Damascus, toward the north [^c]beside Hamath, [^d]running from east to west, Dan, one _portion_. 







###### 2 



Beside the border of Dan, from the east side to the west side, Asher, one _portion_. 







###### 3 



Beside the border of Asher, from the east side to the west side, Naphtali, one _portion_. 







###### 4 



Beside the border of Naphtali, from the east side to the west side, Manasseh, one _portion_. 







###### 5 



Beside the border of Manasseh, from the east side to the west side, Ephraim, one _portion_. 







###### 6 



Beside the border of Ephraim, from the east side to the west side, Reuben, one _portion_. 







###### 7 



Beside the border of Reuben, from the east side to the west side, Judah, one _portion_. 







###### 8 



"And beside the border of Judah, from the east side to the west side, shall be the [^e]allotment which you shall [^f]set apart, twenty-five thousand [^g]_cubits_ in width, and in length like one of the portions, from the east side to the west side; and the sanctuary shall be in the middle of it. 







###### 9 



The allotment that you shall set apart to the LORD _shall be_ twenty-five thousand _cubits_ in length and ten thousand in width. ## Portion for the Priests 







###### 10 



The holy allotment shall be for these, _namely_ for the priests, toward the north twenty-five thousand _cubits in length_, toward the west ten thousand in width, toward the east ten thousand in width, and toward the south twenty-five thousand in length; and the sanctuary of the LORD shall be in its midst. 







###### 11 



_It shall be_ for the priests who are sanctified of the sons of Zadok, who have [^h]taken the responsibility I gave them, who did not go astray when the sons of Israel went astray as the Levites went astray. 







###### 12 



It shall be an allotment to them from the allotment of the land, a most holy reserve, by the border of the Levites. 







###### 13 



And alongside the border of the priests, the Levites _shall have_ twenty-five thousand _cubits_ in length and ten thousand in width. The entire length _shall be_ twenty-five thousand _cubits_ and the width ten thousand. 







###### 14 



Moreover, they shall not sell or exchange any of it, or allow this [^i]choice _portion_ of land to pass _to others_; for it is holy to the LORD. 







###### 15 



"The remainder, five thousand _cubits_ in width _and_ twenty-five thousand [^j]in length, shall be for common use for the city, for homes and for [^k]open spaces; and the city shall be in its midst. 







###### 16 



And these _shall be_ its measurements: the north side, 4,500 _cubits_, the south side 4,500 _cubits_, the east side 4,500 _cubits_, and the west side, 4,500 _cubits_. 







###### 17 



The city shall have [^l]open spaces: on the north 250 _cubits_, on the south 250 _cubits_, on the east 250 _cubits_, and on the west 250 _cubits_. 







###### 18 



The remainder of the length alongside the holy allotment shall be ten thousand _cubits_ toward the east and ten thousand toward the west; and it shall be [^m]alongside the holy allotment. And its produce shall be food for the workers of the city. 







###### 19 



And the workers of the city, out of all the tribes of Israel, shall cultivate it. 







###### 20 



The whole allotment _shall be_ twenty-five thousand by twenty-five thousand _cubits_; you shall [^n]set apart the holy allotment, a [^o]square, with the [^p]property of the city. ## Portion for the Prince 







###### 21 



"The remainder _shall be_ for the prince, on the one side and on the other of the holy allotment and of the [^q]property of the city; in front of the twenty-five thousand _cubits_ of the allotment toward the east border and westward in front of the twenty-five thousand toward the west border, alongside the portions, _it shall be_ for the prince. And the holy allotment and the sanctuary of the house shall be in the middle of it. 







###### 22 



And exclusive of the [^r]property of the Levites and the [^s]property of the city, _which are_ in the middle of that which belongs to the prince, _everything_ between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin shall belong to the prince. ## Portion for Other Tribes 







###### 23 



"As for the rest of the tribes: from the east side to the west side, Benjamin, one _portion_. 







###### 24 



Beside the border of Benjamin, from the east side to the west side, Simeon, one _portion_. 







###### 25 



Beside the border of Simeon, from the east side to the west side, Issachar, one _portion_. 







###### 26 



Beside the border of Issachar, from the east side to the west side, Zebulun, one _portion_. 







###### 27 



Beside the border of Zebulun, from the east side to the west side, Gad, one _portion_. 







###### 28 



And beside the border of Gad, at the south side toward the south, the border shall be from Tamar to the waters of Meribath-kadesh, to the brook _of Egypt_, to the Great Sea. 







###### 29 



This is the land which you shall divide by lot to the tribes of Israel for an inheritance, and these are their _several_ portions," declares the Lord [^t]God. ## The City Gates 







###### 30 



"Now these are the exits of the city: on the north side, 4,500 _cubits_ by measurement, 







###### 31 



[^u]shall be the gates of the city, [^v]named for the tribes of Israel, three gates toward the north: the gate of Reuben, one; the gate of Judah, one; _and_ the gate of Levi, one. 







###### 32 



On the east side, 4,500 _cubits_, [^w]shall be three gates: the gate of Joseph, one; the gate of Benjamin, one; _and_ the gate of Dan, one. 







###### 33 



On the south side, 4,500 _cubits_ by measurement, [^x]shall be three gates: the gate of Simeon, one; the gate of Issachar, one; _and_ the gate of Zebulun, one. 







###### 34 



On the west side, 4,500 _cubits, shall be_ three gates: the gate of Gad, one; the gate of Asher, one; _and_ the gate of Naphtali, one. 







###### 35 



_The city shall be_ eighteen thousand _cubits_ all around; and the name of the city from _that_ day _shall be_, '[^y]The LORD is there.'" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

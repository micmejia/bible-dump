# Ezekiel 5

***








###### 1 



"As for you, son of man, take a sharp sword; take and [^a]use it _as_ a barber's razor on your head and beard. Then take scales for weighing and divide [^b]the hair. 







###### 2 



A third you shall burn in the fire at the center of the city, when the days of the siege are completed. Then you shall take a third and strike _it_ with the sword all around [^c]the city, and a third you shall scatter to the wind; for I will unsheathe a sword behind them. 







###### 3 



Take also a few _hairs_ in number from [^d]them and bind them in the hems of your _robes_. 







###### 4 



Take again some of them and throw them into the fire and burn them in the fire; from it a fire will [^e]spread to all the house of Israel. 







###### 5 



"This is what the Lord [^f]God says: 'This is Jerusalem; I have placed her at the center of the nations, with lands around her. 







###### 6 



But she has rebelled against My ordinances more wickedly than the nations, and against My statutes more than the lands which surround her; for they have rejected My ordinances and have not walked [^g]in My statutes.' 







###### 7 



Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: 'Because you have more turmoil than the nations that surround you _and_ have not walked in My statutes, nor executed My ordinances, nor acted in accordance with the ordinances of the nations around you,' 







###### 8 



therefore, this is what the Lord God says: 'Behold, I, even I, am against you, and I will execute judgments among you in the sight of the nations. 







###### 9 



And because of all your abominations I will do among you what I have not done, and the like of which I will never do again. 







###### 10 



Therefore, fathers will eat _their_ sons among you, and sons will eat their fathers; for I will execute judgments on you and scatter all your remnant to every wind. 







###### 11 



Therefore as I live,' declares the Lord God, 'Because you have defiled My sanctuary with all your detestable idols and with all your abominations, I definitely will also withdraw and My eye will have no pity, and I also will not spare. 







###### 12 



A third of you will die by plague or perish by famine among you, a third will fall by the sword around you, and a third I will scatter to every wind, and I will unsheathe a sword behind them. 







###### 13 



'Then My anger will be spent and I will satisfy My wrath on them, and I will be appeased; then they will know that I, the LORD, have spoken in My zeal, when I have spent My wrath upon them. 







###### 14 



Moreover, I will make you a site of ruins and a disgrace among the nations that surround you, in the sight of everyone who passes by. 







###### 15 



So [^h]it will be a disgrace, an _object of_ abuse, a warning, and an object of horror to the nations that surround you when I execute judgments against you in anger, wrath, and raging reprimands. I, the LORD, have spoken. 







###### 16 



When I send against them the [^i]deadly arrows of famine which [^j]were for the destruction of those whom I will send to destroy you, then I will also intensify the famine upon you and break off your [^k]provision of bread. 







###### 17 



I will send on you famine and vicious animals, and they will bereave you of children; plague and bloodshed also will pass through you, and I will bring the sword on you. I, the LORD, have spoken.'" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

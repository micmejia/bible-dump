# Ezekiel 7

***








###### 1 



Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 







###### 2 



"And you, son of man, this is what the Lord [^a]God says to the land of Israel: 'An end! The end is coming on the four corners of the land. 







###### 3 



Now the end is upon you, for I will send My anger against you; I will judge you according to your ways and [^b]bring all your abominations upon you. 







###### 4 



And My eye will have no pity on you, nor will I spare _you_, but I will [^c]bring your ways upon you, and your abominations will be among you; then you will know that I am the LORD!' 







###### 5 



"This is what the Lord [^d]God says: 'A disaster, a unique disaster, behold, it is coming! 







###### 6 



An end [^e]is coming; the end has come! It has awakened against you; behold, it has come! 







###### 7 



Your [^f]doom has come to you, you inhabitant of the land. The time has come, the day is near--panic rather than joyful shouting _on the_ mountains. 







###### 8 



Now I will shortly pour out My wrath on you and expend My anger against you; I will judge you according to your ways and [^g]bring on you all your abominations. 







###### 9 



My eye will have no pity nor will I spare _you_. I will [^h]repay you according to your ways, while your abominations are in your midst; then you will know that I, the LORD, am striking. 







###### 10 



'Behold, the day! Behold, it is coming! _Your_ [^i]doom has gone forth; the rod has budded, arrogance has blossomed. 







###### 11 



Violence [^j]has grown into a rod of wickedness. None of them _shall remain_, none of their [^k]people, none of their wealth, nor _anything_ eminent among them. 







###### 12 



The time has come, the day has arrived. Let neither the buyer rejoice nor the seller mourn; for wrath is against all their multitude. 







###### 13 



Indeed, the seller will not [^l]regain [^m]what he sold as long as [^n]they _both_ live; for the vision regarding all their multitude will not [^o]be averted, nor will any of them maintain his life by his wrongdoing. 







###### 14 



'They have blown the trumpet and made everything ready, but no one is going to the battle, for My wrath is against all [^p]their multitude. 







###### 15 



The sword is outside _the city_ and the plague and the famine are within. _Anyone_ who is in the field will die by the sword, while famine and the plague will consume those in the city. 







###### 16 



Even when their survivors escape, they will be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, each over his own wrongdoing. 







###### 17 



All hands will hang limp, and all [^q]knees will drip with water. 







###### 18 



They will put on sackcloth and shuddering will overwhelm them; and shame _will be_ on all faces, and a [^r]bald patch on all their heads. 







###### 19 



They will fling their silver into the streets, and their gold will become an abhorrent thing; their silver and their gold will not be able to save them on the day of the wrath of the LORD. They cannot satisfy their [^s]appetite, nor can they fill their stomachs, because their wrongdoing has become a cause of stumbling. ## The Temple Profaned 







###### 20 



Moreover, they transformed the splendor of His jewels into pride, and they made the images of their abominations _and_ their detestable things with it; therefore I will make it an abhorrent thing to them. 







###### 21 



And I will hand it over to the foreigners as plunder, and to the wicked of the earth as spoils; and they will profane it. 







###### 22 



I will also turn My face away from them, and they will profane My treasure; then robbers will enter and profane it. 







###### 23 



'Make the [^t]chain, for the land is full of [^u]bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence. 







###### 24 



Therefore, I will bring the worst of the nations, and they will take possession of their houses. I will also put an end to the pride of the strong ones, and their holy places will be profaned. 







###### 25 



When anguish comes, they will seek peace, but there will be none. 







###### 26 



Disaster will come upon disaster and rumor will be _added_ to rumor; then they will seek a vision from a prophet, but the Law will be lost from the priest, and counsel from the elders. 







###### 27 



The king will mourn, the prince will be clothed in horror, and the hands of the people of the land will [^v]tremble. I will deal with them because of their conduct, and by their judgments I will judge them. And they will know that I am the LORD.'" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Ezra 6

***








###### 1 



Then King Darius issued a decree, and a search was conducted in the [^a]archives, where the treasures were stored in Babylon. 







###### 2 



And in [^b]Ecbatana, in the fortress which is in the province of Media, a scroll was found; and the following was written in it: "Memorandum-- 







###### 3 



In the first year of King Cyrus, Cyrus the king issued a decree: '_Concerning_ the house of God in Jerusalem, let the [^c]temple, the place where sacrifices are offered, be rebuilt, and let [^d]its foundations be repaired, its height _being_ [^e]sixty cubits _and_ its width sixty cubits, 







###### 4 



_with_ three layers of large stones and [^f]one layer of timber. And the cost is to be paid from the [^g]royal treasury. 







###### 5 



Also the gold and silver utensils of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, are to be returned and [^h]brought to their places in the temple in Jerusalem; and you shall put _them_ in the house of God.' 







###### 6 



"Now _as for you_, Tattenai, governor of _the province_ beyond the _Euphrates_ River, Shethar-bozenai, and [^i]your colleagues, the officials of _the provinces_ beyond the River, [^j]stay away from there. 







###### 7 



Leave that work on the house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews rebuild that house of God on its site. 







###### 8 



Furthermore, I issue a decree concerning what you are to do for these elders of Judah in the rebuilding of that house of God: the full cost is to be paid to those people from the royal treasury out of the taxes of _the provinces_ beyond the _Euphrates_ River, _and_ that without interruption. 







###### 9 



And whatever is needed, bulls, rams, and lambs for burnt offerings to the God of heaven, and wheat, salt, wine, and anointing oil, as the priests in Jerusalem order, _it_ is to be given to them daily without fail, 







###### 10 



so that they may offer acceptable sacrifices to the God of heaven and pray for the lives of the king and his sons. 







###### 11 



And I issued a decree that any person who violates this decree, a timber shall be pulled out of his house and he shall be impaled on it; and his house shall be turned into a refuse heap on account of this. 







###### 12 



May the God who has caused His name to dwell there overthrow any king or people who [^k]attempts to [^l]change _it_, so as to destroy that house of God in Jerusalem. I, Darius, have issued _this_ decree; _it_ is to be carried out with all diligence!" ## The Temple Completed and Dedicated 







###### 13 



Then Tattenai, the governor of _the province_ beyond the _Euphrates_ River, Shethar-bozenai, and their colleagues carried out _the decree_ with all diligence, just as King Darius had [^m]ordered. 







###### 14 



And the elders of the Jews [^n]were successful in building through the prophecy of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And [^o]they finished building following the command of the God of Israel and the decree of Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia. 







###### 15 



Now this [^p]temple was completed [^q]on the third day of the month Adar; it was the sixth year of the reign of King Darius. 







###### 16 



And the sons of Israel, the priests, the Levites, and the rest of the [^r]exiles, celebrated the dedication of this house of God with joy. 







###### 17 



They offered for the dedication of this temple of God a hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs, and as a sin offering for all Israel twelve male goats, corresponding to the number of the tribes of Israel. 







###### 18 



Then they appointed the priests to their divisions and the Levites in their sections for the service of God in Jerusalem, as it is written in the Book of Moses. ## The Passover Held 







###### 19 



The exiles held the Passover on the fourteenth of the first month. 







###### 20 



For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves together; all of them were pure. Then they slaughtered the Passover _lambs_ for all the exiles, both for their brothers the priests and for themselves. 







###### 21 



And the sons of Israel who returned from exile and all those who had separated themselves from the impurity of the nations of the land to _join_ them, to seek the LORD God of Israel, ate _the Passover_. 







###### 22 



And they held the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days with joy, because the LORD had made them happy, and had turned the heart of the king of Assyria toward them to [^s]encourage them in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Galatians 1

***








###### 1 



Paul, an apostle (not _sent_ from men nor through human agency, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised Him from the dead), 







###### 2 



and all the brothers who are with me, To the churches of Galatia: 







###### 3 



Grace to you and peace from [^a]God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, 







###### 4 



who gave Himself for our sins so that He might rescue us from this present evil [^b]age, according to the will of our God and Father, 







###### 5 



to whom _be_ the glory forevermore. Amen. ## Distortion of the Gospel 







###### 6 



I am amazed that you are so quickly deserting Him who called you [^c]by the grace of Christ, for a different gospel, 







###### 7 



which is not _just_ another _account_; but there are some who are disturbing you and want to distort the gospel of Christ. 







###### 8 



But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to what we have preached to you, he is to be [^d]accursed! 







###### 9 



As we have said before, even now I say again: if anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received, he is to be [^e]accursed! 







###### 10 



For am I now seeking the favor of people, or of God? Or am I striving to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a bond-servant of Christ. ## Paul Defends His Ministry 







###### 11 



For I would have you know, brothers _and sisters_, that the gospel which was preached by me is not [^f]of human invention. 







###### 12 



For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but _I received it_ through a revelation of Jesus Christ. 







###### 13 



For you have heard of my former way of life in Judaism, how I used to persecute the church of God beyond measure and tried to destroy it; 







###### 14 



and I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries among my [^g]countrymen, being more extremely zealous for my ancestral traditions. 







###### 15 



But when [^h]He who had set me apart _even_ from my mother's womb and called _me_ through His grace was pleased 







###### 16 



to reveal His Son in me so that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with [^i]flesh and blood, 







###### 17 



nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those _who were_ apostles before me; but I went away to Arabia, and returned once more to Damascus. 







###### 18 



Then three years later I went up to Jerusalem to [^j]become acquainted with [^k]Cephas, and stayed with him for fifteen days. 







###### 19 



But I did not see another one of the apostles except [^l]James, the Lord's brother. 







###### 20 



(Now in what I am writing to you, [^m]I assure you before God that I am not lying.) 







###### 21 



Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia. 







###### 22 



I was _still_ unknown by [^n]sight to the churches of Judea which are in Christ; 







###### 23 



but they only kept hearing, "The man who once persecuted us is now preaching the faith which he once tried to destroy." 







###### 24 



And they were glorifying God [^o]because of me. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

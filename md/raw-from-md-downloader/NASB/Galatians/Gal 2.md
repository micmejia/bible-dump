# Galatians 2

***








###### 1 



Then after an interval of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along also. 







###### 2 



[^a]It was because of a revelation that I went up; and I submitted to them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but _I did so_ in private to those who were of reputation, for fear that somehow I might be running, or had run, in vain. 







###### 3 



But not even Titus, who was with me, though he was a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised. 







###### 4 



Yet _it was a concern_ because of the false brothers secretly brought in, who had sneaked in to spy on our freedom which we have in Christ Jesus, in order to enslave us. 







###### 5 



But we did not yield in subjection to them, even for an hour, so that the truth of the gospel would remain with you. 







###### 6 



But from those who [^b]were of considerable repute (what they were makes no difference to me; God shows no favoritism)--well, those who were of repute contributed nothing to me. 







###### 7 



But on the contrary, seeing that I had been entrusted with the gospel [^c]to the uncircumcised, just as Peter _had been_ [^d]to the circumcised 







###### 8 



(for He who was at work for Peter in _his_ apostleship [^e]to the circumcised was at work for me also to the Gentiles), 







###### 9 



and recognizing the grace that had been given to me, [^f]James and [^g]Cephas and John, who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right [^h]hand of fellowship, so that we _might_ _go_ to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcised. 







###### 10 



_They_ only _asked_ us to remember the poor--the very thing I also was eager to do. ## Peter (Cephas) Opposed by Paul 







###### 11 



But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he [^i]stood condemned. 







###### 12 



For prior to the coming of some men from [^j]James, he used to eat with the Gentiles; but when they came, he _began_ to withdraw and separate himself, fearing those from the circumcision. 







###### 13 



The rest of the Jews joined him in hypocrisy, with the result that even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy. 







###### 14 



But when I saw that they were not [^k]straightforward about the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in the presence of all, "If you, being a Jew, live like the Gentiles and not like the Jews, how _is it that_ you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?[^l] 







###### 15 



"We _are_ Jews by nature and not sinners from the Gentiles; 







###### 16 



nevertheless, knowing that a person is not justified by works of [^m]the Law but through faith in Christ Jesus, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of [^n]the Law; since by works of [^o]the Law no [^p]flesh will be justified. 







###### 17 



But if, while seeking to be justified in Christ, we ourselves have also been found sinners, is Christ then a servant of sin? [^q]Far from it! 







###### 18 



For if I rebuild what I have _once_ destroyed, I prove myself to be a wrongdoer. 







###### 19 



For through [^r]the Law I died to [^s]the Law, so that I might live for God. 







###### 20 



I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and [^t]the _life_ which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me. 







###### 21 



I do not nullify the grace of God, for if righteousness _comes_ through [^u]the Law, then Christ died needlessly." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

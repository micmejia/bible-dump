# Galatians 3

***








###### 1 



[^a]You foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed _as_ crucified? 







###### 2 



This is the only thing I want to find out from you: did you receive the Spirit by works of [^b]the Law, or by hearing [^c]with faith? 







###### 3 



Are you so foolish? Having begun [^d]by the Spirit, are you now [^e]being perfected by the flesh? 







###### 4 



Did you [^f]suffer so many things in vain--if indeed it was in vain? 







###### 5 



So then, does He who provides you with the Spirit and works [^g]miracles among you, do it by works of [^h]the Law, or by hearing [^i]with faith? 







###### 6 



Just as Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness. 







###### 7 



Therefore, recognize that it is those who are of faith who are sons of Abraham. 







###### 8 



The Scripture, foreseeing that God [^j]would justify the [^k]Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, _saying_, "All the nations will be blessed in you." 







###### 9 



So then, those who are of faith are blessed with [^l]Abraham, the believer. 







###### 10 



For all who are of works of [^m]the Law are under a curse; for it is written: "Cursed is everyone who does not abide by all the things written in the book of the Law, to do them." 







###### 11 



Now, that no one is justified [^n]by [^o]the Law before God is evident; for, "[^p]the righteous one will live by faith." 







###### 12 



[^q]However, the Law is not [^r]of faith; on the contrary, "The person who performs [^s]them will live by [^t]them." 







###### 13 



Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law, having become a curse for us--for it is written: "Cursed is everyone who hangs on a [^u]tree"-- 







###### 14 



in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham would come to the Gentiles, so that we would receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. ## Intent of the Law 







###### 15 



Brothers _and sisters_, I speak [^v]in terms of human relations: even though it is _only_ a man's [^w]covenant, yet when it has been ratified, no one sets it aside or adds [^x]conditions to it. 







###### 16 



Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He does not say, "And to seeds," as _one would in referring_ to many, but _rather_ as _in referring_ to one, "And to your seed," that is, Christ. 







###### 17 



What I am saying is this: the Law, which came 430 years later, does not invalidate a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to nullify the promise. 







###### 18 



For if the inheritance is [^y]based on law, it is no longer [^z]based on a promise; but God has granted it to Abraham by means of a promise. 







###### 19 



Why the Law then? It was added on account of the [^aa]violations, having been ordered through angels at the hand of a [^ab]mediator, until the Seed would come to whom the promise had been made. 







###### 20 



Now a mediator is not [^ac]for one _party only_; but God is _only_ one. 







###### 21 



Is the Law then contrary to the promises of God? [^ad]Far from it! For if a law had been given that was able to impart life, then righteousness [^ae]would indeed have been [^af]based on law. 







###### 22 



But the Scripture has confined [^ag]everyone under sin, so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe. 







###### 23 



But before faith came, [^ah]we were kept in custody under the Law, being confined for the faith that was destined to be revealed. 







###### 24 



Therefore the Law has become our [^ai]guardian _to lead us_ to Christ, so that we may be justified by faith. 







###### 25 



But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a [^aj]guardian. 







###### 26 



For you are all sons _and daughters_ of God through faith in Christ Jesus. 







###### 27 



For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. 







###### 28 



There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is [^ak]neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. 







###### 29 



And if you [^al]belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's [^am]descendants, heirs according to promise. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

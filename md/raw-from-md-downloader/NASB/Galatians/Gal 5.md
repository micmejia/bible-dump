# Galatians 5

***








###### 1 



It was for freedom that Christ set us free; therefore keep standing firm and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery. 







###### 2 



Look! I, Paul, tell you that if you have yourselves circumcised, Christ will be of no benefit to you. 







###### 3 



And I testify again to every man who has himself circumcised, that he is obligated to keep the whole Law. 







###### 4 



You have been severed from Christ, you who [^a]are seeking to be justified by the [^b]Law; you have fallen from grace. 







###### 5 



For we, [^c]through the Spirit, [^d]by faith, are waiting for the hope of righteousness. 







###### 6 



For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything, but faith working through love. 







###### 7 



You were running well; who hindered you from obeying the truth? 







###### 8 



This persuasion _did_ not _come_ from Him who calls you. 







###### 9 



A little [^e]leaven leavens the whole lump _of dough_. 







###### 10 



I have confidence [^f]in you in the Lord, that you will adopt no other view; but the one who is disturbing you will bear the punishment, whoever he is. 







###### 11 



But as for me, brothers _and sisters_, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the stumbling block of the cross has been eliminated. 







###### 12 



I wish that those who are troubling you would even [^g]emasculate themselves. 







###### 13 



For you were called to freedom, brothers _and sisters_; only _do_ not _turn_ your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh, but serve one another through love. 







###### 14 



For the whole Law is fulfilled in one word, in the _statement_, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself." 







###### 15 



But if you bite and devour one another, take care that you are not consumed by one another. 







###### 16 



But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh. 







###### 17 



For the desire of the flesh is against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are in opposition to one another, in order to keep you from doing whatever you want. 







###### 18 



But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the Law. 







###### 19 



Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are: sexual immorality, impurity, indecent behavior, 







###### 20 



idolatry, witchcraft, hostilities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions, 







###### 21 



envy, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these, of which I forewarn you, just as I have forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. 







###### 22 



But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 







###### 23 



gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law. 







###### 24 



Now those who [^h]belong to Christ Jesus crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. 







###### 25 



If we live by the Spirit, let's follow the Spirit as well. 







###### 26 



Let's not become boastful, challenging one another, envying one another. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

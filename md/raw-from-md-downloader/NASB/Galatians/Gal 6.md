# Galatians 6

***








###### 1 



Brothers _and sisters_, even if a person is caught in any wrongdoing, you who are spiritual are to restore such a person in a spirit of gentleness; _each one_ looking to yourself, so that you are not tempted as well. 







###### 2 



Bear one another's burdens, and thereby fulfill the law of Christ. 







###### 3 



For if anyone thinks that he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself. 







###### 4 



But each one must examine his own work, and then he will have _reason for_ boasting, _but_ [^a]to himself alone, and not [^b]to another. 







###### 5 



For each one will bear his own load. 







###### 6 



The one who is taught the word is to share all good things with the one who teaches _him_. 







###### 7 



Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a person sows, this he will also reap. 







###### 8 



For the one who sows to his own flesh will reap destruction from the flesh, but the one who sows to the Spirit will reap eternal life from the Spirit. 







###### 9 



Let's not become discouraged in doing good, for in due time we will reap, if we do not become weary. 







###### 10 



So then, [^c]while we have opportunity, let's do good to all people, and especially to those who are of the household of the faith. 







###### 11 



See with what large letters I have written to you with my own hand! 







###### 12 



All who want to make a good showing in the flesh try to compel you to be circumcised, simply so that they will not be persecuted for the cross of Christ. 







###### 13 



For those who [^d]are circumcised do not even keep [^e]the Law themselves, but they want to have you circumcised so that they may boast in your flesh. 







###### 14 



But [^f]far be it from me to boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through [^g]which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. 







###### 15 



For neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new [^h]creation. 







###### 16 



And all who will follow this rule, peace and mercy _be_ upon them, and upon the Israel of God. 







###### 17 



From now on let no one cause trouble for me, for I bear on my body the [^i]marks of Jesus. 







###### 18 



The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers _and sisters_. Amen. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

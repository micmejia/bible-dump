# Genesis 10

***








###### 1 



Now these are _the records of_ the generations of the sons of Noah: Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and sons were born to them after the flood. 







###### 2 



The sons of Japheth _were_ Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras. 







###### 3 



The sons of Gomer _were_ Ashkenaz, [^a]Riphath, and Togarmah. 







###### 4 



The sons of Javan _were_ Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and [^b]Dodanim. 







###### 5 



From these _the people of_ the coastlands of the nations [^c]were separated into their lands, every one according to his language, according to their families, into their nations. 







###### 6 



The sons of Ham _were_ Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan. 







###### 7 



The sons of Cush _were_ Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca; and the sons of Raamah _were_ Sheba and Dedan. 







###### 8 



Now Cush fathered Nimrod; he [^d]became a mighty one on the earth. 







###### 9 



He was a mighty hunter before the LORD; therefore it is said, "Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before the LORD." 







###### 10 



And the beginning of his kingdom was [^e]Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. 







###### 11 



From that land he went to Assyria, and built Nineveh, Rehoboth-Ir, Calah, 







###### 12 



and Resen between Nineveh and Calah; that is the great city. 







###### 13 



Mizraim fathered Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim, 







###### 14 



Pathrusim, Casluhim (from whom came the Philistines), and Caphtorim. 







###### 15 



Canaan fathered Sidon, his firstborn, and Heth, 







###### 16 



the Jebusite, the Amorite, the Girgashite, 







###### 17 



the Hivite, the Arkite, the Sinite, 







###### 18 



the Arvadite, the Zemarite, and the Hamathite; and afterward the families of the Canaanite were spread abroad. 







###### 19 



The territory of the Canaanite [^f]extended from Sidon [^g]going toward Gerar, as far as Gaza; _and_ [^h]going toward Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha. 







###### 20 



These are the sons of Ham, according to their families, according to their languages, by their lands, _and_ by their nations. 







###### 21 



Also to Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, _and_ the older brother of Japheth, _children_ were born. 







###### 22 



The sons of Shem _were_ Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram. 







###### 23 



The sons of Aram _were_ Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash. 







###### 24 



Arpachshad fathered Shelah; and Shelah fathered Eber. 







###### 25 



Two sons were born to Eber; the name of the one _was_ [^i]Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided; and his brother's name _was_ Joktan. 







###### 26 



Joktan fathered Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, 







###### 27 



Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, 







###### 28 



[^j]Obal, Abimael, Sheba, 







###### 29 



Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab; all of these were the sons of Joktan. 







###### 30 



Now their [^k]settlement [^l]extended from Mesha [^m]going toward Sephar, the hill country of the east. 







###### 31 



These are the sons of Shem, according to their families, according to their languages, by their lands, _and_ according to their nations. 







###### 32 



These are the families of the sons of Noah, according to their descendants, by their nations; and out of these the nations were separated on the earth after the flood. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

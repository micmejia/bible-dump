# Genesis 11

***








###### 1 



Now all the earth [^a]used the same language and [^b]the same words. 







###### 2 



And it came about, as they journeyed [^c]east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar and [^d]settled there. 







###### 3 



Then they said to one another, "Come, let's make bricks and [^e]fire _them_ thoroughly." And they used brick for stone, and they used tar for mortar. 







###### 4 



And they said, "Come, let's build ourselves a city, and a tower whose top _will reach_ into heaven, and let's make a name for ourselves; otherwise we will be scattered abroad over the face of all the earth." 







###### 5 



Now the LORD came down to see the city and the tower which the [^f]men had built. 







###### 6 



And the LORD said, "Behold, they are one people, and they all have [^g]the same language. And this is what they have started to do, and now nothing which they plan to do will be [^h]impossible for them. 







###### 7 



Come, [^i]let Us go down and there confuse their [^j]language, so that they will not understand one another's [^k]speech." 







###### 8 



So the LORD scattered them abroad from there over the face of all the earth; and they stopped building the city. 







###### 9 



Therefore it was named [^l]Babel, because there the LORD confused the [^m]language of all the earth; and from there the LORD scattered them abroad over the face of all the earth. ## Descendants of Shem

###### 28 



Haran died [^n]during the lifetime of his father Terah in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldeans.

Abram and Nahor took wives for themselves. The name of Abram's wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife was Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah [^o]and Iscah.

Sarai was unable to conceive; she did not have a child.

###### 32 



The days of Terah were 205 years; and Terah died in Haran. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Genesis 12

***








###### 1 



Now the LORD said to Abram, "Go from your country, And from your relatives And from your father's house, To the land which I will show you; 







###### 2 



And I will make you into a great nation, And I will bless you, And make your name great; And _you shall_ be a blessing; 







###### 3 



And I will bless those who bless you, And the one who [^a]curses you I will [^b]curse. And in you all the families of the earth will be blessed." 







###### 4 



So Abram went _away_ as the LORD had spoken to him; and Lot went with him. Now Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran. 







###### 5 



Abram took his wife Sarai and his nephew Lot, and all their possessions which they had accumulated, and the [^c]people which they had acquired in Haran, and they [^d]set out for the land of Canaan; so they came to the land of Canaan. 







###### 6 



Abram passed through the land as far as the site of Shechem, to the [^e]oak of Moreh. Now the Canaanites _were_ in the land at that time. 







###### 7 



And the LORD appeared to Abram and said, "To your [^f]descendants I will give this land." So he built an altar there to the LORD who had appeared to him. 







###### 8 



Then he proceeded from there to the mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east; and there he built an altar to the LORD and called upon the name of the LORD. 







###### 9 



Then Abram journeyed on, continuing toward the [^g]Negev. 







###### 10 



Now there was a famine in the land; so Abram went down to Egypt to live there for a time, because the famine was severe in the land. 







###### 11 



It came about, when he [^h]was approaching Egypt, that he said to his wife Sarai, "See now, I know that you are a [^i]beautiful woman; 







###### 12 



and when the Egyptians see you, they will say, 'This is his wife'; and they will kill me, but they will let you live. 







###### 13 



Please say that you are my sister so that it may go well for me because of you, and that [^j]I may live on account of you." 







###### 14 



Now it came about, when Abram entered Egypt, that the Egyptians [^k]saw that the woman was very beautiful. 







###### 15 



Pharaoh's officials saw her and praised her to Pharaoh; and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house. 







###### 16 



Therefore he treated Abram well for her sake; and [^l]he gave him sheep, oxen, male donkeys, male servants and female servants, female donkeys, and camels. 







###### 17 



But the LORD struck Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram's wife. 







###### 18 



Then Pharaoh called Abram and said, "What is this _that_ you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife? 







###### 19 



Why did you say, 'She is my sister,' so that I took her for myself as a wife? Now then, [^m]here is your wife, take her and go!" 







###### 20 



And Pharaoh commanded _his_ men concerning him; and they [^n]escorted him away, with his wife and all that belonged to him. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Genesis 13

***








###### 1 



So Abram went up from Egypt to the [^a]Negev, he and his wife and all that belonged to him, and Lot with him. 







###### 2 



Now Abram was very rich in livestock, silver, and gold. 







###### 3 



And he went [^b]on his journeys from the [^c]Negev as far as Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai, 







###### 4 



to the place of the altar which he had made there previously; and there Abram called on the name of the LORD. 







###### 5 



Now Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks, herds, and tents. 







###### 6 



And the land could not [^d]support _both of_ them [^e]while living together, for their possessions were so great that they were not able to remain together. 







###### 7 



And there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram's livestock and the herdsmen of Lot's livestock. Now the Canaanites and the Perizzites were living in the land at that time. 







###### 8 



So Abram said to Lot, "Please let there be no strife between you and me, nor between my herdsmen and your herdsmen, for we are relatives! 







###### 9 



Is the entire land not before you? Please separate from me; if _you choose_ the left, then I will go to the right; or if _you choose_ the right, then I will go to the left." 







###### 10 



Lot raised his eyes and saw all the [^f]vicinity of the Jordan, that it was well watered everywhere--_this was_ before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah--like the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt [^g]going toward Zoar. 







###### 11 



So Lot chose for himself all the [^h]vicinity of the Jordan, and Lot journeyed eastward. So they separated from each other. 







###### 12 



Abram [^i]settled in the land of Canaan, while Lot [^j]settled in the cities of the [^k]vicinity of the _Jordan_, and moved his tents as far as Sodom. 







###### 13 



Now the men of Sodom were [^l]exceedingly wicked sinners against the LORD. 







###### 14 



The LORD said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him, "Now raise your eyes and look from the place where you are, northward and southward, and eastward and westward; 







###### 15 



for all the land which you see I will give to you and to your [^m]descendants forever. 







###### 16 



I will make your [^n]descendants as _plentiful as_ the dust of the earth, so that if anyone can count the dust of the earth, then your [^o]descendants could also be counted. 







###### 17 



Arise, walk about in the land through its length and width; for I will give it to you." 







###### 18 



Then Abram moved his tent and came and lived by the [^p]oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron; and there he built an altar to the LORD. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

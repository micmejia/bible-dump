# Genesis 16

***








###### 1 



Now Sarai, Abram's wife, had not borne him a child, but she had an Egyptian slave woman whose name was Hagar. 







###### 2 



So Sarai said to Abram, "See now, the LORD has prevented me from bearing _children_. Please have relations with my slave woman; perhaps I will [^a]obtain children through her." And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai. 







###### 3 



And _so_ after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, Abram's wife Sarai took Hagar the Egyptian, her slave woman, and gave her to her husband Abram as his wife. 







###### 4 



Then he had relations with Hagar, and she conceived; and when _Hagar_ became aware that she had conceived, her mistress was insignificant in her sight. 







###### 5 



So Sarai said to Abram, "May the wrong done to me be upon you! I put my slave woman into your [^b]arms, but when she saw that she had conceived, I was insignificant in her [^c]sight. May the LORD judge between [^d]you and me." 







###### 6 



But Abram said to Sarai, "Look, your slave woman is in your [^e]power; do to her what is good in your [^f]sight." So Sarai treated her harshly, and she fled from her presence. 







###### 7 



Now the angel of the LORD found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, by the spring on the way to Shur. 







###### 8 



He said, "Hagar, Sarai's slave woman, from where have you come, and where are you going?" And she said, "I am fleeing from the presence of my mistress Sarai." 







###### 9 



So the angel of the LORD said to her, "Return to your mistress, and submit [^g]to her authority." 







###### 10 



The angel of the LORD also said to her, "I will greatly multiply your [^h]descendants so that [^i]they will be too many to count." 







###### 11 



The angel of the LORD said to her further, "Behold, you are pregnant, And you will give birth to a son; And you shall name him [^j]Ishmael, Because the LORD has heard your affliction. 







###### 12 



But he will be a wild donkey of a man; His hand _will be_ against everyone, And everyone's hand _will be_ against him; And he will live [^k]in defiance of all his brothers." 







###### 13 



Then she called the name of the LORD who spoke to her, "[^l]You are [^m]a God who sees me"; for she said, "Have I even seen _Him_ here _and lived_ after [^n]He saw me?" 







###### 14 



Therefore the well was called [^o]Beer-lahai-roi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered. 







###### 15 



So Hagar bore a son to Abram; and Abram named his son, to whom Hagar gave birth, Ishmael. 







###### 16 



Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to [^p]him. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

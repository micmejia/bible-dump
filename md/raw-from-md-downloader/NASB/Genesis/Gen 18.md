# Genesis 18

***








###### 1 



Now the LORD appeared to [^a]Abraham by the [^b]oaks of Mamre, while he was sitting at the tent door in the heat of the day. 







###### 2 



When he raised his eyes and looked, behold, three men were standing opposite him; and when he saw _them_, he ran from the tent door to meet them and bowed down to the ground, 







###### 3 



and said, "[^c]My Lord, if now I have found favor in Your sight, please do not [^d]pass Your servant by. 







###### 4 



Please let a little water be brought and wash [^e]your feet, and make yourselves comfortable under the tree; 







###### 5 



and I will [^f]bring a piece of bread, so that you may [^g]refresh yourselves; after that you may go on, since you have [^h]visited your servant." And they said, "So do as you have said." 







###### 6 



So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah, and said, "[^i]Quickly, prepare three [^j]measures of fine flour, knead _it_, and make bread cakes." 







###### 7 



Abraham also ran to the herd, and took a tender and [^k]choice calf and gave _it_ to the servant, and he hurried to prepare it. 







###### 8 



He took curds and milk and the calf which he had prepared, and set _it_ before them; and he was standing by them under the tree [^l]as they ate. 







###### 9 



Then they said to him, "Where is your wife Sarah?" And he said, "There, in the tent." 







###### 10 



He said, "I will certainly return to you [^m]at this time next year; and behold, your wife Sarah will have a son." And Sarah was listening at the tent door, which was behind him. 







###### 11 



Now Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in age; Sarah was past [^n]childbearing. 







###### 12 



So Sarah laughed [^o]to herself, saying, "After I have become old, am I to have pleasure, my lord being old also?" 







###### 13 



But the LORD said to Abraham, "Why did Sarah laugh, saying, 'Shall I actually give birth _to a child_, when I am _so_ old?' 







###### 14 



Is anything too [^p]difficult for the LORD? At the appointed time I will return to you, [^q]at this time next year, and Sarah will have a son." 







###### 15 



Sarah denied _it_, however, saying, "I did not laugh"; for she was afraid. And He said, "No, but you did laugh." 







###### 16 



Then the men rose up from there, and looked down toward Sodom; and Abraham was walking with them to send them off. 







###### 17 



The LORD said, "Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do, 







###### 18 



since Abraham will certainly become a great and [^r]mighty nation, and in him all the nations of the earth will be blessed? 







###### 19 



For I have [^s]chosen him, so that he may command his children and his household after him to keep the way of the LORD by doing righteousness and justice, so that the LORD may bring upon Abraham what He has spoken about him." 







###### 20 



And the LORD said, "The outcry of Sodom and Gomorrah is indeed great, and their sin is exceedingly grave. 







###### 21 



I will go down now and see whether they have done entirely as the outcry, which has come to Me _indicates_; and if not, I will know." ## Abraham Appeals for Sodom 







###### 22 



Then the men turned away from there and went toward Sodom, while Abraham was still standing before the LORD. 







###### 23 



Abraham approached and said, "Will You indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked? 







###### 24 



Suppose there are fifty righteous people within the city; will You indeed sweep _it_ away and not [^t]spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous who are in it? 







###### 25 



Far be it from You to do [^u]such a thing, to kill the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous and the wicked are _treated_ alike. Far be it from You! Shall not the Judge of all the earth [^v]deal justly?" 







###### 26 



So the LORD said, "If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will [^w]spare the entire place on their account." 







###### 27 



And Abraham replied, "Now behold, I have [^x]ventured to speak to the Lord, although I am _only_ dust and ashes. 







###### 28 



Suppose the fifty righteous are lacking five, will You destroy the entire city because of five?" And He said, "I will not destroy _it_ if I find forty-five there." 







###### 29 



And he spoke to Him yet again and said, "Suppose forty are found there?" And He said, "I will not do _it_ on account of the forty." 







###### 30 



Then he said, "Oh may the Lord not be angry, and I shall speak; suppose thirty are found there?" And He said, "I will not do _it_ if I find thirty there." 







###### 31 



And he said, "Now behold, I have [^y]ventured to speak to the Lord; suppose twenty are found there?" And He said, "I will not destroy _it_ on account of the twenty." 







###### 32 



Then he said, "Oh may the Lord not be angry, and I shall speak only this once: suppose ten are found there?" And He said, "I will not destroy _it_ on account of the ten." 







###### 33 



As soon as He had finished speaking to Abraham the LORD departed, and Abraham returned to his place. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

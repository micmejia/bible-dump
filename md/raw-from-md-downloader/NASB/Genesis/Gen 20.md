# Genesis 20

***








###### 1 



Now Abraham journeyed from there toward the land of the [^a]Negev, and [^b]settled between Kadesh and Shur; then he lived for a time in Gerar. 







###### 2 



And Abraham said of his wife Sarah, "She is my sister." So Abimelech king of Gerar sent _men_ and took Sarah. 







###### 3 



But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, "Behold, you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is [^c]married." 







###### 4 



Now Abimelech had not come near her; and he said, "Lord, will You kill a nation, even _though_ [^d]blameless? 







###### 5 



Did he himself not say to me, 'She is my sister'? And she herself said, 'He is my brother.' In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my [^e]hands I have done this." 







###### 6 



Then God said to him in the dream, "Yes, I know that in the integrity of your heart you have done this, and I also [^f]kept you from sinning against Me; therefore I did not let you touch her. 







###### 7 



Now then, return the man's wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you will live. But if you do not return _her_, know that you will certainly die, you and all who are yours." 







###### 8 



So Abimelech got up early in the morning and called all his servants, and told all these things in their [^g]presence; and the people were greatly frightened. 







###### 9 



Then Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, "What have you done to us? And [^h]how have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You have done to me [^i]things that ought not to be done." 







###### 10 



And Abimelech said to Abraham, "What have you [^j]encountered, that you have done this thing?" 







###### 11 



Abraham said, "Because I thought, surely there is no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife. 







###### 12 



Besides, she actually is my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife; 







###### 13 



and it came about, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said to her, 'This is [^k]the kindness which you will show to me: [^l]everywhere we go, say of me, "He is my brother."'" 







###### 14 



Abimelech then took sheep and oxen and male and female servants, and gave them to Abraham, and returned his wife Sarah to him. 







###### 15 



Abimelech said, "Behold, my land is before you; [^m]settle wherever [^n]you please." 







###### 16 



To Sarah he said, "Look, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. [^o]It is [^p]your vindication before all who are with you, and before everyone you are cleared." 







###### 17 



Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech and his wife and his female slaves, so that they gave birth _to children_. 







###### 18 



For the LORD had completely closed all the wombs of the household of Abimelech because of Sarah, Abraham's wife. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

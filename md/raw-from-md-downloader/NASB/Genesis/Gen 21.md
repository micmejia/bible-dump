# Genesis 21

***








###### 1 



Then the LORD took note of Sarah as He had said, and the LORD did for Sarah as He had [^a]promised. 







###### 2 



So Sarah conceived and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the appointed time of which God had spoken to him. 







###### 3 



Abraham named his son who was born to him, the son whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac. 







###### 4 



Then Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him. 







###### 5 



Now Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him. 







###### 6 



Sarah said, "God has made laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh [^b]with me." 







###### 7 



And she said, "Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have given birth to a son in his old age." 







###### 8 



And the child grew and was weaned, and Abraham held a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned. ## Sarah Turns against Hagar 







###### 9 



Now Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking _Isaac_. 







###### 10 



Therefore she said to Abraham, "Drive out this slave woman and her son, for the son of this slave woman shall not be an heir with my son [^c]Isaac!" 







###### 11 



The matter [^d]distressed Abraham greatly because of his son _Ishmael_. 







###### 12 



But God said to Abraham, "[^e]Do not be distressed because of the boy and your slave woman; whatever Sarah tells you, listen to her, for through Isaac [^f]your descendants shall be named. 







###### 13 



And of the son of the slave woman I will make a nation also, because he is your [^g]descendant." 







###### 14 



So Abraham got up early in the morning and took bread and a [^h]skin of water, and gave _them_ to Hagar, putting _them_ on her shoulder, and _gave her_ the boy, and sent her away. And she departed and wandered about in the wilderness of Beersheba. 







###### 15 



When the water in the skin was used up, she [^i]left the boy under one of the bushes. 







###### 16 



Then she went and sat down opposite him, about a bowshot away, for she said, "May I not [^j]see the boy die!" And she sat opposite him, and raised her voice and wept. 







###### 17 



God heard the boy crying; and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, "[^k]What is the matter with you, Hagar? Do not fear, for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is. 







###### 18 



Get up, lift up the boy, and hold him by [^l]the hand, for I will make a great nation of him." 







###### 19 



Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went and filled the [^m]skin with water and gave the boy a drink. 







###### 20 



And God was with the boy, and he grew; and he lived in the wilderness and became an archer. 







###### 21 



He lived in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt. ## Covenant with Abimelech 







###### 22 



Now it came about at that time that Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, spoke to Abraham, saying, "God is with you in all that you do; 







###### 23 



so now, swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me or with my offspring or with my descendants, but according to the kindness that I have shown to you, you shall show to me and to the land in which you have resided." 







###### 24 



Abraham said, "I swear it." 







###### 25 



But Abraham [^n]complained to Abimelech because of the well of water which the servants of Abimelech had seized. 







###### 26 



And Abimelech said, "I do not know who has done this thing; you did not tell me, nor did I hear of it [^o]until today." 







###### 27 



So Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two of them made a covenant. 







###### 28 



But Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves. 







###### 29 



Then Abimelech said to Abraham, "What do these seven ewe lambs mean, which you have set by themselves?" 







###### 30 



He said, "You shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand so that it may be a witness for me, that I dug this well." 







###### 31 



Therefore he called that place [^p]Beersheba, because there the two of them took an oath. 







###### 32 



So they made a covenant at Beersheba; and Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, got up and returned to the land of the Philistines. 







###### 33 



_Abraham_ planted a tamarisk tree at Beersheba, and there he called on the name of the LORD, the Everlasting God. 







###### 34 



And Abraham resided in the land of the Philistines for many days. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

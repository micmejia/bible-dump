# Genesis 23

***








###### 1 



Now [^a]Sarah lived 127 years; _these were_ the years of the life of Sarah. 







###### 2 



Sarah died in Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan; and Abraham [^b]came in to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her. 







###### 3 



Then Abraham arose from _mourning_ before his dead, and spoke to the sons of Heth, saying, 







###### 4 



"I am a stranger and a foreign resident among you; give me [^c]a burial site among you so that I may bury my dead out of my sight." 







###### 5 



The sons of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him, 







###### 6 



"Hear us, my lord: you are a [^d]mighty prince among us; bury your dead in the choicest of our graves; none of us will refuse you his grave for burying your dead." 







###### 7 



So Abraham stood up and bowed to the people of the land, the sons of Heth. 







###### 8 



And he spoke with them, saying, "If [^e]you are willing to _let me_ bury my dead out of my sight, listen to me, and plead with Ephron the son of Zohar for me, 







###### 9 



that he may give me the cave of Machpelah which he owns, which is at the end of his field; for the full price let him give it to me in [^f]your presence for [^g]a burial site." 







###### 10 



Now Ephron was sitting among the sons of Heth; and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham [^h]so that the sons of Heth heard, that is, all who entered the gate of his city, saying, 







###### 11 



"No, my lord, listen to me; I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. In the presence of the sons of my people I give it to you; bury your dead." 







###### 12 



And Abraham bowed before the people of the land. 







###### 13 



But he spoke to Ephron [^i]so that the people of the land heard, saying, "If you will only please listen to me; I will give the price of the field, accept _it_ from me so that I may bury my dead there." 







###### 14 



Then Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him, 







###### 15 



"My lord, listen to me: _a plot of_ land worth [^j]four hundred shekels of silver--what is that between me and you? So bury your dead." 







###### 16 



Abraham listened to Ephron; and Abraham weighed out for Ephron the silver which he had named in the [^k]presence of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, _currency_ acceptable to a merchant. 







###### 17 



So Ephron's field, which was in Machpelah, which faced Mamre, the field and the cave which was in it, and all the trees which were in the field, that were [^l]within all the confines of its border, [^m]were deeded over 







###### 18 



to Abraham as a possession in the presence of the sons of Heth, before all who entered the gate of his city. 







###### 19 



After this, Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave of the field of Machpelah facing Mamre (that is, Hebron), in the land of Canaan. 







###### 20 



So the field and the cave that was in it [^n]were deeded over to Abraham for [^o]a burial site by the sons of Heth. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

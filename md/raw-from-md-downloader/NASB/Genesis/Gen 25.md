# Genesis 25

***








###### 1 



Now Abraham took another wife, [^a]whose name was Keturah. 







###### 2 



She bore to him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. 







###### 3 



Jokshan fathered Sheba and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim. 







###### 4 



The sons of Midian _were_ Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All of these _were_ the sons of Keturah. 







###### 5 



Now Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac; 







###### 6 



but to the sons of [^b]his concubines, Abraham gave gifts while he was still living, and sent them away from his son Isaac eastward, to the land of the east. 







###### 7 



These are [^c]all the years of Abraham's life that he lived, 175 years. 







###### 8 



Abraham breathed his last and died at a good old age, an old man and satisfied _with life_; and he was gathered to his people. 







###### 9 



Then his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, facing Mamre, 







###### 10 



the field which Abraham purchased from the sons of Heth; there Abraham was buried with his wife Sarah. 







###### 11 



It came about after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac [^d]lived by Beer-lahai-roi. ## Descendants of Ishmael 







###### 12 



Now these are _the records of_ the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's slave woman, bore to Abraham; 







###### 13 



and these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, [^e]in the order of their birth: Nebaioth, the firstborn of Ishmael, Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, 







###### 14 



Mishma, Dumah, Massa, 







###### 15 



Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. 







###### 16 



These are the sons of Ishmael and these are their names, by their villages, and by their camps; twelve princes according to their [^f]tribes. 







###### 17 



These are the years of the life of Ishmael, 137 years; and he breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people. 







###### 18 



They [^g]settled from Havilah to Shur which is [^h]east of Egypt [^i]going toward Assyria; he [^j]settled in defiance of all his relatives. ## Isaac's Sons 







###### 19 



Now these are _the records of_ the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham fathered Isaac; 







###### 20 



and Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the [^k]Aramean of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the [^l]Aramean, to be his wife. 







###### 21 



Isaac prayed to the LORD on behalf of his wife, because she was unable to have children; and the LORD [^m]answered him, and his wife Rebekah conceived. 







###### 22 



But the children struggled together within her; and she said, "If it is so, why am I _in_ this _condition_?" So she went to inquire of the LORD. 







###### 23 



And the LORD said to her, "Two nations are in your womb; And two peoples will be separated from your body; And one people will be stronger than the other; And the older will serve the younger." 







###### 24 



When her days _leading_ to the delivery were at an end, behold, there were twins in her womb. 







###### 25 



Now the first came out red, all over like a hairy garment; and they named him Esau. 







###### 26 



Afterward his brother came out with his hand holding on to Esau's heel, so he was named [^n]Jacob; and Isaac was sixty years old when she gave birth to them. 







###### 27 



When the boys grew up, Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the field; but Jacob was a [^o]civilized man, living in tents. 







###### 28 



Now Isaac loved Esau because [^p]he had a taste for game; but Rebekah loved Jacob. 







###### 29 



When Jacob had cooked a stew _one day_, Esau came in from the field and he was exhausted; 







###### 30 



and Esau said to Jacob, "Please let me have a mouthful of [^q]that red stuff there, for I am exhausted." Therefore he was called [^r]Edom _by_ name. 







###### 31 



But Jacob said, "[^s]First sell me your birthright." 







###### 32 



Esau said, "Look, I am about to die; so of what _use_ then is the birthright to me?" 







###### 33 



And Jacob said, "[^t]First swear to me"; so he swore _an oath_ to him, and sold his birthright to Jacob. 







###### 34 



Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew; and he ate and drank, and got up and went on his way. So Esau despised his birthright. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

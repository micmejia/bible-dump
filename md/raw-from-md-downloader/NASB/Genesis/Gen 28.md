# Genesis 28

***








###### 1 



So Isaac called Jacob and blessed him and commanded him, [^a]saying to him, "You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan. 







###### 2 



Arise, go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel your mother's father; and from there take to yourself a wife from the daughters of Laban, your mother's brother. 







###### 3 



May [^b]God Almighty bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you, so that you may become a multitude of peoples. 







###### 4 



May He also give you the blessing of Abraham, to you and to your [^c]descendants with you, so that you may possess the land where you live as a stranger, which God gave to Abraham." 







###### 5 



Then Isaac sent Jacob away, and he went to Paddan-aram to Laban, son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau. 







###### 6 



Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan-aram to take to himself a wife from there, _and that_ when he blessed him he commanded him, saying, "You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan," 







###### 7 



and that Jacob had obeyed his father and his mother and had gone to Paddan-aram. 







###### 8 



So Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan displeased [^d]his father Isaac; 







###### 9 



and Esau went to Ishmael, and [^e]married, besides the wives that he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son, the sister of Nebaioth. ## Jacob's Dream 







###### 10 



Then Jacob departed from Beersheba and went toward Haran. 







###### 11 



And he [^f]happened upon a [^g]particular place and spent the night there, because the sun had set; and he took one of the stones of the place and made it a support for his head, and lay down in that place. 







###### 12 



And he had a dream, and behold, a ladder was set up on the earth with its top reaching to heaven; and behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it. 







###### 13 



Then behold, the LORD was standing [^h]above it and said, "I am the LORD, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac; the land on which you lie I will give to you and to your [^i]descendants. 







###### 14 



Your [^j]descendants will also be like the dust of the earth, and you will [^k]spread out to the west and to the east, and to the north and to the south; and in you and in your [^l]descendants shall all the families of the earth be blessed. 







###### 15 



Behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land; for I will not leave you until I have done what I have [^m]promised you." 







###### 16 



Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, "The LORD is certainly in this place, and I did not know it!" 







###### 17 



And he was afraid and said, "How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven!" 







###### 18 



So Jacob got up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had placed as a support for his head, and set it up as a memorial stone, and poured oil on its top. 







###### 19 



Then he named that place [^n]Bethel; but [^o]previously the name of the city had been Luz. 







###### 20 



Jacob also made a vow, saying, "If God will be with me and will keep me on this journey that I [^p]take, and give me [^q]food to eat and garments to wear, 







###### 21 



and I return to my father's house in [^r]safety, then the LORD will be my God. 







###### 22 



And this stone, which I have set up as a memorial stone, will be God's house, and of everything that You give me I will assuredly give a tenth to You." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

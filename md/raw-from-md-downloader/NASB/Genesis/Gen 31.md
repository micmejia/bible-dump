# Genesis 31

***








###### 1 



Now [^a]Jacob heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, "Jacob has taken away all that was our father's, and from what belonged to our father he has made all this [^b]wealth." 







###### 2 



And Jacob saw the [^c]attitude of Laban, and behold, it was not _friendly_ toward him as _it had been_ before. 







###### 3 



Then the LORD said to Jacob, "Return to the land of your fathers and to your relatives, and I will be with you." 







###### 4 



So Jacob sent _word_ and called Rachel and Leah to his flock in the field, 







###### 5 



and said to them, "I see your father's [^d]attitude, that it is not _friendly_ toward me as _it was_ before, but the God of my father has been with me. 







###### 6 



You know that I have served your father with all my strength. 







###### 7 



Yet your father has cheated me and changed my wages ten times; however, God did not allow him to do me harm. 







###### 8 



If he said this: 'The speckled shall be your wages,' then all the flock delivered speckled; and if he said this: 'The striped shall be your wages,' then all the flock delivered striped. 







###### 9 



So God has taken away your father's livestock and given _them_ to me. 







###### 10 



And it came about at the time when the flock was breeding that I raised my eyes and saw in a dream--and behold--the male goats that were [^e]mating _were_ striped, speckled, or mottled. 







###### 11 



Then the angel of God said to me in the dream, 'Jacob'; and I said, 'Here I am.' 







###### 12 



He said, 'Now raise your eyes and see _that_ all the male goats that are [^f]mating are striped, speckled, or mottled; for I have seen everything that Laban has been doing to you. 







###### 13 



I am the God _of_ Bethel, where you anointed a memorial stone, where you made a vow to Me; now arise, [^g]leave this land, and return to the land of your birth.'" 







###### 14 



Rachel and Leah said to him, "Do we still have any share or inheritance in our father's house? 







###### 15 



Are we not regarded by him as foreigners? For he has sold us, and has also [^h]entirely consumed our [^i]purchase price. 







###### 16 



Surely all the wealth which God has taken away from our father belongs to us and our children; now then, do whatever God has told you." 







###### 17 



Then Jacob stood up and put his children and his wives on camels; 







###### 18 



and he drove away all his livestock and all his property which he had acquired, the livestock he possessed which he had acquired in Paddan-aram, to go to the land of Canaan to his father Isaac. 







###### 19 



Laban had gone to shear his flock, and Rachel stole the [^j]household idols that were her father's. 







###### 20 



And Jacob [^k]deceived Laban the Aramean by not telling him that he was fleeing. 







###### 21 



So he fled with all that he had; and he got up and crossed the _Euphrates_ River, and set [^l]out for the hill country of Gilead. ## Laban Pursues Jacob 







###### 22 



When Laban was informed on the third day that Jacob had fled, 







###### 23 



he took his kinsmen with him and pursued him _a distance of_ seven days' journey, and he overtook him in the hill country of Gilead. 







###### 24 



However, God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream of the night and said to him, "[^m]Be careful that you do not speak to Jacob either good or bad." 







###### 25 



And Laban caught up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country, and Laban with his kinsmen camped in the hill country of Gilead. 







###### 26 



Then Laban said to Jacob, "What have you done [^n]by deceiving me and carrying away my daughters like captives of the sword? 







###### 27 



Why did you flee secretly and [^o]deceive me, and did not tell me, so that I might have sent you away with joy and with songs, with tambourine and with lyre; 







###### 28 



and did not allow me to kiss my [^p]grandchildren and my daughters? Now you have done foolishly. 







###### 29 



It is in [^q]my power to do you harm, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, '[^r]Be careful not to speak either good or bad to Jacob.' 







###### 30 



Now you have indeed gone away because you longed greatly for your father's house; _but_ why did you steal my gods?" 







###### 31 



Then Jacob replied to Laban, "Because I was afraid, for I thought that you would take your daughters from me by force. 







###### 32 



The one with whom you find your gods shall not live; in the presence of our relatives [^s]point out what is yours [^t]among my belongings and take _it_ for yourself." Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them. 







###### 33 



So Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the tent of the two slave women, but he did not find _them_. Then he went out of Leah's tent and entered Rachel's tent. 







###### 34 



Now Rachel had taken the [^u]household idols and put them in the camel's saddlebag, and she sat on them. So Laban searched through all the tent, but did not find _them_. 







###### 35 



And she said to her father, "May my lord not be angry that I cannot stand in your presence, because the [^v]way of women is upon me." So he searched but did not find the [^w]household idols. 







###### 36 



Then Jacob became angry and argued with Laban; and Jacob said to Laban, "What is my offense? What is my sin that you have hotly pursued me? 







###### 37 



Though you have searched through all my property, what have you found of all your household property? Set _it_ here in front of my relatives and your relatives, so that they may decide between the two of us. 







###### 38 



For these twenty years I _have been_ with you; your ewes and your female goats have not miscarried, nor have I eaten the rams of your flocks. 







###### 39 



I did not _even_ bring to you that which was torn _by wild animals_; I took the loss myself. You demanded it of my hand _whether_ stolen by day or stolen by night. 







###### 40 



_This is how_ I was: by day the [^x]heat consumed me and the frost by night, and my sleep fled from my eyes. 







###### 41 



For these twenty years I have been in your house; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you changed my wages ten times. 







###### 42 



If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the fear of Isaac, had not been for me, surely now you would have sent me away empty-handed. God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands, so He rendered judgment last night." ## The Covenant of Mizpah 







###### 43 



Then Laban replied to Jacob, "The daughters are my daughters, the [^y]children are my [^z]grandchildren, the flocks are my flocks, and everything that you see is mine. But what can I do this day to these daughters of mine or to their children to whom they have given birth? 







###### 44 



So now come, let's make a covenant, [^aa]you and I, and it shall be a witness between [^ab]you and me." 







###### 45 



Then Jacob took a stone and set it up _as_ a memorial stone. 







###### 46 



Jacob said to his relatives, "Gather stones." So they took stones and made a heap, and they ate there by the heap. 







###### 47 



Now Laban called it [^ac]Jegar-sahadutha, but Jacob called it [^ad]Galeed. 







###### 48 



Laban said, "This heap is a witness between [^ae]you and me this day." Therefore it was named Galeed, 







###### 49 



and [^af]Mizpah, for he said, "May the LORD keep watch between [^ag]you and me when we are [^ah]absent one from the other. 







###### 50 



If you mistreat my daughters, or if you take wives besides my daughters, _although_ no one is with us, see, God is witness between [^ai]you and me." 







###### 51 



Laban also said to Jacob, "Behold this heap and behold the memorial stone which I have set between [^aj]you and me. 







###### 52 



This heap is a witness, and the memorial stone is a witness, that I will not pass by this heap to you for harm, and you will not pass by this heap and this memorial stone to me, for harm. 







###### 53 



The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us." So Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac. 







###### 54 



Then Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain, and called his relatives to [^ak]the meal; and they ate [^al]the meal and spent the night on the mountain. 







###### 55 



[^am]Then early in the morning Laban got up, and kissed his [^an]grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them. Then Laban departed and returned to his place. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

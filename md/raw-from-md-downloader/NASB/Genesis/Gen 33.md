# Genesis 33

***








###### 1 



Then Jacob raised his eyes and looked, and behold, Esau was coming, and four hundred men with him. So he divided the children [^a]among Leah and Rachel, and the two slave women. 







###### 2 



He put the slave women and their children [^b]in front, and Leah and her children [^c]next, and Rachel and Joseph [^d]last. 







###### 3 



But he himself passed on ahead of them and bowed down to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother. 







###### 4 



Then Esau ran to meet him and embraced him, and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept. 







###### 5 



He raised his eyes and saw the women and the children, and said, "[^e]Who are these with you?" So he said, "The children whom God has graciously given your servant." 







###### 6 



Then the slave women came forward [^f]with their children, and they bowed down. 







###### 7 



And Leah likewise came forward with her children, and they bowed down; and afterward Joseph came forward with Rachel, and they bowed down. 







###### 8 



And he said, "What do you mean by all this company which I have met?" And he said, "To find favor in the sight of my lord." 







###### 9 



But Esau said, "I have plenty, my brother; let what you have be your own." 







###### 10 



Jacob said, "No, please, if now I have found favor in your sight, then accept my gift from my hand, [^g]for I see your face as one sees the face of God, and you have received me favorably. 







###### 11 



Please accept my [^h]gift which has been brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me and because I have [^i]plenty." So he urged him, and he accepted _it_. 







###### 12 



Then [^j]Esau said, "Let's journey on and go, and I will go ahead of you." 







###### 13 



But he said to him, "My lord knows that the children are frail and that the flocks and herds that are nursing are [^k]a matter of concern to me. And if they are driven hard _just_ one day, all the flocks will die. 







###### 14 



Please let my lord pass on ahead of his servant, and I will proceed at my leisure, at the pace of the cattle that are ahead of me and at the pace of the children, until I come to my lord at Seir." 







###### 15 



Then Esau said, "Please let me leave with you some of the people who are with me." But he said, "[^l]What need is there? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord." 







###### 16 



So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir. 







###### 17 



But Jacob journeyed to [^m]Succoth, and built for himself a house and made booths for his livestock; therefore the place is named Succoth. ## Jacob Settles in Shechem 







###### 18 



Now Jacob came safely to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan-aram, and camped before the city. 







###### 19 



He bought the plot of land where he had pitched his tent from the hand of the sons of Hamor, Shechem's father, for a hundred [^n]pieces of money. 







###### 20 



Then he erected there an altar and called it [^o]El-Elohe-Israel. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

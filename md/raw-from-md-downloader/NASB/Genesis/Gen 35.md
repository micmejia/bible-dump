# Genesis 35

***








###### 1 



Then God said to Jacob, "Arise, go up to Bethel and live there, and make an altar there to God, who appeared to you when you fled [^a]from your brother Esau." 







###### 2 



So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, "Remove the foreign gods which are among you, and purify yourselves and change your garments; 







###### 3 



and let's arise and go up to Bethel, and I will make an altar there to God, who answered me on the day of my distress and has been with me [^b]wherever I have gone." 







###### 4 



So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods which [^c]they had and the rings which were in their ears, and Jacob hid them under the [^d]oak which was near Shechem. 







###### 5 



As they journeyed, there was [^e]a great terror upon the cities which were around them, and they did not pursue the sons of Jacob. 







###### 6 



So Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him. 







###### 7 



Then he built an altar there, and called the place [^f]El-bethel, because there God had revealed Himself to him when he fled [^g]from his brother. 







###### 8 



Now Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died, and she was buried below Bethel under the oak; and it was named [^h]Allon-bacuth. ## Jacob Is Named Israel 







###### 9 



Then God appeared to Jacob again when he came from Paddan-aram, and He blessed him. 







###### 10 



God said to him, "Your name is Jacob; [^i]You shall no longer be called Jacob, But Israel shall be your name." So He called [^j]him Israel. 







###### 11 



God also said to him, "I am [^k]God Almighty; Be fruitful and multiply; A nation and a multitude of nations shall [^l]come from you, And kings shall [^m]come from [^n]you. 







###### 12 



And the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give to you, And I will give the land to your [^o]descendants after you." 







###### 13 



Then God went up from him at the place where He had spoken with him. 







###### 14 



So Jacob set up a memorial stone in the place where He had spoken with him, a memorial of stone, and he poured out a drink offering on it; he also poured oil on it. 







###### 15 



And Jacob named the place where God had spoken with him, [^p]Bethel. 







###### 16 



Then they journeyed on from Bethel; but when there was still some distance to go to Ephrath, Rachel began to give birth and she suffered severe difficulties in her labor. 







###### 17 



And when she was suffering severe difficulties in her labor, the midwife said to her, "Do not fear, for you have another son!" 







###### 18 



And it came about, as her soul was departing (for she died), that she named him [^q]Ben-oni; but his father called him [^r]Benjamin. 







###### 19 



So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem). 







###### 20 



And Jacob set up a memorial stone over her grave; that is the memorial stone of Rachel's grave to this day. 







###### 21 



Then Israel journeyed on and pitched his tent beyond the [^s]tower of [^t]Eder. ## The Sons of Israel 







###### 22 



And it came about, while Israel was living in that land, that Reuben went and slept with his father's concubine Bilhah, and Israel heard _about it_. Now there were twelve sons of Jacob-- 







###### 23 



the sons of Leah _were_ Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, then Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun; 







###### 24 



the sons of Rachel _were_ Joseph and Benjamin; 







###### 25 



and the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's female slave, _were_ Dan and Naphtali; 







###### 26 



and the sons of Zilpah, Leah's female slave, _were_ Gad and Asher. These _were_ the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Paddan-aram. 







###### 27 



Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre of Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had resided. 







###### 28 



Now the days of Isaac were 180 years. 







###### 29 



Then Isaac breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people, an old man [^u]of ripe age; and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Genesis 36

***








###### 1 



Now these are _the records of_ the generations of Esau (that is, Edom). 







###### 2 



Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the [^a]granddaughter of Zibeon the Hivite; 







###### 3 



also Basemath, Ishmael's daughter, the sister of Nebaioth. 







###### 4 



Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, and Basemath gave birth to Reuel, 







###### 5 



and Oholibamah gave birth to Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These are the sons of Esau who were born to him in the land of Canaan. 







###### 6 



Then Esau took his wives, his sons, his daughters, and all [^b]his household, and his livestock and all his cattle, and all his property which he had acquired in the land of Canaan, and went to _another_ land away from his brother Jacob. 







###### 7 



For their possessions had become too great for them to live together, and the land where they resided could not support them because of their livestock. 







###### 8 



So Esau lived in the hill country of Seir; Esau is Edom. ## Descendants of Esau 







###### 9 



These then are _the records of_ the generations of Esau the father of [^c]the Edomites in the hill country of Seir. 







###### 10 



These are the names of Esau's sons: Eliphaz the son of Esau's wife Adah, _and_ Reuel the son of Esau's wife Basemath. 







###### 11 



The sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, [^d]Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz. 







###### 12 



Timna was a concubine of Esau's son Eliphaz, and she bore Amalek to Eliphaz. These are the sons of Esau's wife Adah. 







###### 13 



And these are the sons of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These were the sons of Esau's wife Basemath. 







###### 14 



And these were the sons of Esau's wife Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah, the [^e]granddaughter of Zibeon: [^f]she bore to Esau Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. 







###### 15 



These are the chiefs of the sons of Esau. The sons of Eliphaz, the firstborn of Esau, are chief Teman, chief Omar, chief Zepho, chief Kenaz,

chief Korah, chief Gatam, _and_ chief Amalek. These are the chiefs [^g]descended from Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Adah. 







###### 17 



And these are the sons of Reuel, Esau's son: chief Nahath, chief Zerah, chief Shammah, _and_ chief Mizzah. These are the chiefs [^h]descended from Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Esau's wife Basemath. 







###### 18 



And these are the sons of Esau's wife Oholibamah: chief Jeush, chief Jalam, _and_ chief Korah. These are the chiefs [^i]descended from Esau's wife Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah. 







###### 19 



These are the sons of Esau (that is, Edom), and these are their chiefs. 







###### 20 



These are the sons of Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of the land: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, 







###### 21 



Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. These are the chiefs [^j]descended from the Horites, the sons of Seir in the land of Edom. 







###### 22 



And the sons of Lotan were Hori and [^k]Hemam; and Lotan's sister was Timna. 







###### 23 



And these are the sons of Shobal: [^l]Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, [^m]Shepho, and Onam. 







###### 24 



And these are the sons of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah--he is the Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness when he was pasturing the donkeys of his father Zibeon. 







###### 25 



And these are the children of Anah: Dishon, and Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah. 







###### 26 



And these are the sons of [^n]Dishon: [^o]Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran. 







###### 27 



These are the sons of Ezer: Bilhan, Zaavan, and [^p]Akan.

###### 30 



chief Dishon, chief Ezer, _and_ chief Dishan. These are the chiefs [^r]descended from the Horites, according to their _various_ chiefs in the land of Seir. 







###### 31 



Now these are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom before any king reigned over the sons of Israel. 







###### 32 



[^s]Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom, and the name of his city was Dinhabah. 







###### 33

###### 37 



Then Samlah died, and Shaul of Rehoboth on the _Euphrates_ River became king in his place. 







###### 38 



Then Shaul died, and Baal-hanan the son of Achbor became king in his place.

Then Baal-hanan the son of Achbor died, and [^u]Hadar became king in his place; and the name of his city was [^v]Pau; and his wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, daughter of Mezahab.

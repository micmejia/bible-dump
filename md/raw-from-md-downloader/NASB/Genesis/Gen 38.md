# Genesis 38

***








###### 1 



And it came about at that time, that Judah [^a]departed from his brothers and [^b]visited a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah. 







###### 2 



Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua; and he took her _as a wife_ and had relations with her. 







###### 3 



And she conceived and gave birth to a son, and he named him Er. 







###### 4 



Then she conceived again and gave birth to a son, and she named him Onan. 







###### 5 



She gave birth to yet another son and named him Shelah; and it was at Chezib [^c]that she gave birth to him. 







###### 6 



Now Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name _was_ Tamar. 







###### 7 



But Er, Judah's firstborn, was evil in the sight of the LORD, so the LORD took his life. 







###### 8 



Then Judah said to Onan, "Have relations with your brother's wife and perform your duty as a brother-in-law to her, and raise up a [^d]child for your brother." 







###### 9 



Now Onan knew that the [^e]child would not be his; so when he had relations with his brother's wife, he [^f]wasted his seed on the ground so that he would not give [^g]a child to his brother. 







###### 10 



But what he did was displeasing in the sight of the LORD; so He took his life also. 







###### 11 



Then Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, "Remain a widow in your father's house until my son Shelah grows up"; for he [^h]thought, "_I am afraid_ that he too may die like his brothers." So Tamar went and lived in her father's house. 







###### 12 



Now [^i]after a considerable time Shua's daughter, the wife of Judah, died; and when [^j]the time of mourning was ended, Judah went up to his sheepshearers at Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite. 







###### 13 



And Tamar was told, "Behold, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep." 







###### 14 



So she [^k]removed her widow's garments and covered _herself_ with a [^l]veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the gateway of [^m]Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah had grown up, and she had not been given to him as a wife. 







###### 15 



When Judah saw her, he assumed she _was_ a prostitute, for she had covered her face. 







###### 16 



So he turned aside to her by the road, and said, "[^n]Here now, let me have relations with you"; for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, "What will you give me, that you may have relations with me?" 







###### 17 



He said, therefore, "I will send you a [^o]young goat from the flock." She then said, "Will you give a pledge until you send _it_?" 







###### 18 



He said, "What pledge shall I give you?" And she said, "Your seal and your cord, and your staff that is in your hand." So he gave _them_ to her and had relations with her, and she conceived by him. 







###### 19 



Then she got up and departed, and [^p]removed her [^q]veil and put on her widow's garments. 







###### 20 



When Judah sent the [^r]young goat by his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman's hand, he did not find her. 







###### 21 



He asked the people of her place, saying, "Where is the temple prostitute who was by the road at Enaim?" But they said, "There has been no temple prostitute here." 







###### 22 



So he returned to Judah, and said, "I did not find her; and furthermore, the people of the place said, 'There has been no temple prostitute here.'" 







###### 23 



Then Judah said, "Let her [^s]keep them, otherwise we will become a laughingstock. [^t]After all, I sent this young goat, but you did not find her." 







###### 24 



Now it was about three months later that Judah was [^u]informed, "Your daughter-in-law Tamar has prostituted herself, and behold, she is also pregnant by prostitution." Then Judah said, "Bring her out and have her burned!" 







###### 25 



It was while she was being brought out that she sent _word_ to her father-in-law, saying, "I am pregnant by the man to whom these things belong." She also said, "Please examine and see, whose signet ring and cords and staff are these?" 







###### 26 



And Judah recognized _them_, and said, "She is more righteous than I, since I did not give her to my son Shelah." And he did not [^v]have relations with her again. 







###### 27 



It came about at the time she was giving birth, that behold, there were twins in her womb. 







###### 28 



Moreover, it took place while she was giving birth, that one _baby_ put out a hand, and the midwife took and tied a scarlet _thread_ on his hand, saying, "This one came out first." 







###### 29 



But it came about as he drew back his hand that behold, his brother came out. Then she said, "What a breach you have made for yourself!" So he was named [^w]Perez. 







###### 30 



Afterward his brother came out who had the scarlet _thread_ on his hand; and he was named [^x]Zerah. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Genesis 39

***








###### 1 



Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an Egyptian officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the bodyguard, bought him [^a]from the Ishmaelites, who had taken him down there. 







###### 2 



And the LORD was with Joseph, so he became a [^b]successful man. And he was in the house of his master, the Egyptian. 







###### 3 



Now his master saw that the LORD was with him and _that_ the LORD made all that he did prosper in his hand. 







###### 4 



So Joseph found favor in his sight and [^c]became his personal servant; and he made him overseer over his house, and [^d]put him in charge of all that he owned. 







###### 5 



It came about that from the time he made him overseer in his house and over all that he owned, the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house on account of Joseph; so the LORD's blessing was upon all that he owned, in the house and in the field. 







###### 6 



So he left [^e]Joseph in charge of everything that he owned; and with him _there_ he did not [^f]concern himself with anything except the [^g]food which he [^h]ate. Now Joseph was handsome in form and appearance. 







###### 7 



And it came about after these events that his master's wife [^i]had her eyes on Joseph, and she said, "Sleep with me." 







###### 8 



But he refused and said to his master's wife, "Look, with me _here_, my master [^j]does not concern himself with anything in the house, and he has [^k]put me in charge of all that he owns. 







###### 9 



[^l]There is no one greater in this house than I, and he has withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. How then could I do this great evil, and sin against God?" 







###### 10 



Though she spoke to Joseph day after day, he did not listen to her to lie beside her _or_ be with her. 







###### 11 



Now it happened [^m]one day that he went into the house to do his work, and none of the people of the household was there inside. 







###### 12 



So she grabbed him by his garment, saying, "Sleep with me!" But he left his garment in her hand and fled, and went outside. 







###### 13 



[^n]When she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled outside, 







###### 14 



she called to the men of her household and said to them, "See, he has brought in a [^o]Hebrew to us to make fun of us; he came in to me to sleep with me, and I [^p]screamed. 







###### 15 



When he heard that I raised my voice and [^q]screamed, he left his garment beside me and fled and went outside." 







###### 16 



So she [^r]left his garment beside her until his master came home. 







###### 17 



Then she spoke to him [^s]with these [^t]words: "The Hebrew slave, whom you brought to us, came in to me to make fun of me; 







###### 18 



but when I raised my voice and [^u]screamed, he left his garment beside me and fled outside." ## Joseph Imprisoned 







###### 19 



Now when his master heard the words of his wife which she spoke to him, saying, "[^v]This is what your slave did to me," his anger burned. 







###### 20 



So Joseph's master took him and put him into the prison, the place where the king's prisoners were confined; and he was there in the prison. 







###### 21 



But the LORD was with Joseph and extended kindness to him, and gave him favor in the sight of the warden of the prison. 







###### 22 



And the warden of the prison [^w]put Joseph in charge of all the prisoners who were in the prison; so that whatever was done there, he was [^x]responsible _for it_. 







###### 23 



The warden of the prison did not supervise anything [^y]under Joseph's authority, because the LORD was with him; and, the LORD made whatever he did prosper. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

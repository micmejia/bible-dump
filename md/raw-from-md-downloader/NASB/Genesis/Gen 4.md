# Genesis 4

***








###### 1 



Now the man [^a]had relations with his wife Eve, and she conceived and gave birth to Cain, and she said, "I have obtained a male _child_ with _the help of_ the LORD." 







###### 2 



And again, she gave birth to his brother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of flocks, but Cain was a cultivator of the ground. 







###### 3 



So it came about [^b]in the course of time that Cain brought an offering to the LORD from the fruit of the ground. 







###### 4 



Abel, on his part also brought _an offering_, from the firstborn of his flock and from their fat portions. And the LORD had regard for Abel and his offering; 







###### 5 



but for Cain and his offering He had no regard. So Cain became very angry and his face [^c]was gloomy. 







###### 6 



Then the LORD said to Cain, "Why are you angry? And why is your face [^d]gloomy? 







###### 7 



If you do well, [^e]will _your face_ not be [^f]cheerful? And if you do not do well, sin is lurking at the door; and its desire is for you, but you must master it." 







###### 8 



Cain [^g]talked to his brother Abel; and it happened that when they were in the field Cain rose up against his brother Abel and killed him. 







###### 9 



Then the LORD said to Cain, "Where is Abel your brother?" And he said, "I do not know. Am I my brother's keeper?" 







###### 10 



Then He said, "What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood is crying out to Me from the ground. 







###### 11 



Now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand. 







###### 12 



When you cultivate the ground, it will no longer yield its strength to you; you will be a wanderer and a drifter on the earth." 







###### 13 



Cain said to the LORD, "My punishment is too great to endure! 







###### 14 



Behold, You have driven me this day from the face of the ground; and I will be hidden from Your face, and I will be a wanderer and a drifter on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me." 







###### 15 



So the LORD said to him, "Therefore whoever kills Cain, vengeance will be taken on him seven times _as much_." And the LORD [^h]placed a mark on Cain, so that no one finding him would kill him. 







###### 16 



Then Cain left the presence of the LORD, and [^i]settled in the land of [^j]Nod, east of Eden. 







###### 17 



Cain [^k]had relations with his wife and she conceived, and gave birth to Enoch; and _Cain_ built a city, and named the city Enoch, after the name of his son. 







###### 18 



Now to Enoch was born Irad, and Irad fathered Mehujael, and Mehujael fathered Methushael, and Methushael fathered Lamech. 







###### 19 



Lamech took two wives for himself: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other, Zillah. 







###### 20 



Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who live in tents and _have_ livestock. 







###### 21 



His brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all those who play the lyre and flute. 







###### 22 



As for Zillah, she also gave birth to Tubal-cain, the forger of all implements of bronze and iron; and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah. 







###### 23 



Lamech said to his wives, "Adah and Zillah, Listen to my voice, You wives of Lamech, Pay attention to my words, For I have killed a man for wounding me; And a boy for striking me! 







###### 24 



If Cain is avenged seven times, Then Lamech seventy-seven times!" 







###### 25 



Adam [^l]had relations with his wife again; and she gave birth to a son, and named him [^m]Seth, for, _she said_, "God [^n]has appointed me another [^o]child in place of Abel, because Cain killed him." 







###### 26 



To Seth also a son was born; and he named him Enosh. Then _people_ began to call [^p]upon the name of the LORD. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

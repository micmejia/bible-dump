# Genesis 40

***








###### 1 



Then it came about after these things, _that_ the cupbearer and the baker for the king of Egypt offended their lord, the king of Egypt. 







###### 2 



And Pharaoh was furious with his two officials, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker. 







###### 3 



So he put them in confinement in the house of the captain of the bodyguard, in the prison, the _same_ place where Joseph was imprisoned. 







###### 4 



And the captain of the bodyguard put Joseph in charge of them, and he [^a]took care of them; and they were in confinement for [^b]some time. 







###### 5 



Then the cupbearer and the baker for the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison, both had a dream the same night, each man with his _own_ dream _and_ each dream with its _own_ interpretation. 







###### 6 



[^c]When Joseph came to them in the morning and saw them, [^d]behold, they were dejected. 







###### 7 



So he asked Pharaoh's officials who were with him in confinement in his master's house, "[^e]Why are your faces so sad today?" 







###### 8 



And they said to him, "We have [^f]had a dream, and there is no one to interpret it." Then Joseph said to them, "Do interpretations not belong to God? Tell _it_ to me, please." 







###### 9 



So the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph, [^g]saying to him, "In my dream, [^h]behold, _there was_ a vine in front of me; 







###### 10 



and on the vine _were_ three branches. And as it was budding, its blossoms came out, _and_ its clusters produced ripe grapes. 







###### 11 



Now Pharaoh's cup was in my hand; so I took the grapes and squeezed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I put the cup into Pharaoh's [^i]hand." 







###### 12 



Then Joseph said to him, "This is the interpretation of it: the three branches are three days; 







###### 13 



within three more days Pharaoh will [^j]lift up your head and restore you to your office; and you will put Pharaoh's cup into his hand as in your former practice when you were his cupbearer. 







###### 14 



Only [^k]keep me in mind when it goes well for you, and please do me a kindness [^l]by mentioning me to Pharaoh, and get me out of this [^m]prison. 







###### 15 



For I was in fact kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews, and even here I have done nothing that they should have put me into the [^n]dungeon." 







###### 16 



When the chief baker saw that he had interpreted favorably, he said to Joseph, "I also _saw_ in my dream, and behold, _there were_ three baskets of white bread on my head; 







###### 17 



and in the top basket _there were_ some of all [^o]kinds of baked food for Pharaoh, and the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head." 







###### 18 



Then Joseph answered and said, "This is its interpretation: the three baskets are three days; 







###### 19 



within three more days Pharaoh will lift up your head from you and will hang you on a wooden _post_, and the birds will eat your flesh off you." 







###### 20 



So it came about on the third day, _which was_ Pharaoh's birthday, that he held a feast for all his servants; and he lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker among his servants. 







###### 21 



He restored the chief cupbearer to his [^p]office, and he put the cup into Pharaoh's [^q]hand; 







###### 22 



but he hanged the chief baker, just as Joseph had interpreted to them. 







###### 23 



Yet the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph, but forgot him. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Genesis 41

***








###### 1 



Now it happened at the end of two full years that Pharaoh had a dream, and behold, he was standing by the Nile. 







###### 2 



And behold, from the Nile seven cows came up, fine-looking and [^a]fat; and they grazed in the marsh grass. 







###### 3 



Then behold, seven other cows came up after them from the Nile, ugly and [^b]thin, and they stood by the _other_ cows on the bank of the Nile. 







###### 4 



Then the ugly and [^c]thin cows ate the seven fine-looking and fat cows. Then Pharaoh awoke. 







###### 5 



But he fell asleep and dreamed a second time; and behold, seven ears of grain came up on a single stalk, plump and good. 







###### 6 



Then behold, seven ears, thin and scorched by the east wind, sprouted up after them. 







###### 7 



And the thin ears swallowed the seven plump and full ears. Then Pharaoh awoke, and behold, _it was_ a dream. 







###### 8 



Now in the morning his spirit was troubled, so he sent _messengers_ and called for all the soothsayer priests of Egypt, and all its wise men. And Pharaoh told them his [^d]dreams, but there was no one who could interpret them for Pharaoh. 







###### 9 



Then the chief cupbearer spoke to Pharaoh, saying, "I would make mention today of my _own_ [^e]offenses. 







###### 10 



Pharaoh was furious with his servants, and he put me in confinement in the house of the captain of the bodyguard, _both_ me and the chief baker. 







###### 11 



Then we had a dream one night, [^f]he and I; each of us dreamed according to the interpretation of his _own_ dream. 







###### 12 



Now a Hebrew youth _was_ there with us, a servant of the captain of the bodyguard, and we told him _the dreams_, and he interpreted our dreams for us. For each man he interpreted according to his _own_ dream. 







###### 13 



And just as he interpreted for us, so it happened; _Pharaoh_ restored me in my office, but he hanged [^g]the chief baker." ## Joseph Interprets 







###### 14 



Then Pharaoh sent _word_ and called for Joseph, and they hurriedly brought him out of the dungeon; and when he had shaved himself and changed his clothes, he came to Pharaoh. 







###### 15 



Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I have had a dream, but no one can interpret it; and I have heard [^h]it said about you, that [^i]when you hear a dream you can interpret it." 







###### 16 



Joseph then answered Pharaoh, saying, "[^j]It has nothing to do with me; God will [^k]give Pharaoh an answer for his own good." 







###### 17 



So Pharaoh said to Joseph, "In my dream, there I was, standing on the bank of the Nile; 







###### 18 



and behold, seven cows, [^l]fat and fine-looking came up out of the Nile, and they grazed in the marsh grass. 







###### 19 



Then behold, seven other cows came up after them, poor and very [^m]ugly and [^n]thin, such as I had never seen for [^o]ugliness in all the land of Egypt; 







###### 20 



and the thin and ugly cows ate the first seven fat cows. 







###### 21 



Yet when they had [^p]devoured them, it could not be [^q]detected that they had [^r]devoured them, [^s]for they were just as ugly as [^t]before. Then I awoke. 







###### 22 



I saw also in my dream, and behold, seven ears of grain, full and good, came up on a single stalk; 







###### 23 



and behold, seven ears, withered, thin, _and_ scorched by the east wind sprouted up after them; 







###### 24 



and the thin ears swallowed the seven good ears. Then I told it to the soothsayer priests, but there was no one who could explain it to me." 







###### 25 



And Joseph said to Pharaoh, "Pharaoh's [^u]dreams are one _and the same_; God has told to Pharaoh what He is about to do. 







###### 26 



The seven good cows are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years; the [^v]dreams are one _and the same_. 







###### 27 



The seven thin and ugly cows that came up after them are seven years, and the seven thin ears scorched by the east wind will be seven years of famine. 







###### 28 



[^w]It is as I have spoken to Pharaoh: God has shown Pharaoh what He is about to do. 







###### 29 



Behold, seven years of great abundance are coming in all the land of Egypt; 







###### 30 



and after them seven years of famine will [^x]come, and all the abundance will be forgotten in the land of Egypt, and the famine will [^y]ravage the land. 







###### 31 



So the abundance will be unknown in the land because of that subsequent famine; for it _will be_ very severe. 







###### 32 



Now as for the repeating of the dream to Pharaoh twice, _it means_ that the matter is confirmed by God, and God will quickly bring it about. 







###### 33 



So now let Pharaoh look for a man discerning and wise, and appoint him over the land of Egypt. 







###### 34 



Let Pharaoh take action to appoint overseers [^z]in charge of the land, and let him take a fifth _of the produce_ of the land of Egypt _as a tax_ in the seven years of abundance. 







###### 35 



Then have them collect all the food of these good years that are coming, and store up the grain for food in the cities under Pharaoh's authority, and have them guard _it_. 







###### 36 



Let the food be _used_ as a reserve for the land for the seven years of famine which will occur in the land of Egypt, so that the land will not perish during the famine." 







###### 37 



Now the [^aa]proposal seemed good [^ab]to Pharaoh and [^ac]to all his servants. ## Joseph Is Made a Ruler of Egypt 







###### 38 



Then Pharaoh said to his servants, "Can we find a man like this, in whom there is a divine spirit?" 







###### 39 



So Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Since God has informed you of all this, there is no one as discerning and wise as you are. 







###### 40 



You shall be [^ad]in charge of my house, and all my people shall [^ae]be obedient to you; only _regarding_ the throne will I be greater than you." 







###### 41 



Pharaoh also said to Joseph, "See, I have placed you over all the land of Egypt." 







###### 42 



Then Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand and put it on Joseph's hand, and clothed him in garments of fine linen, and put the gold necklace around his neck. 







###### 43 



And he had him ride in [^af]his second chariot; and they proclaimed ahead of him, "[^ag]Bow the knee!" And he placed him over all the land of Egypt. 







###### 44 



Moreover, Pharaoh said to Joseph, "_Though_ I am Pharaoh, yet without [^ah]your permission no one shall raise his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt." 







###### 45 



Then Pharaoh named Joseph [^ai]Zaphenath-paneah; and he gave him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of [^aj]On, to _be his_ wife. And Joseph went out over the land of Egypt. 







###### 46 



Now Joseph was thirty years old when he [^ak]stood in the presence of Pharaoh, king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh and went through all the land of Egypt. 







###### 47 



During the seven years of plenty the land produced [^al]abundantly. 







###### 48 



So he collected all the food of _these_ seven years which occurred in the land of Egypt and put the food in the cities; he put in every city the food from its own surrounding fields. 







###### 49 



Joseph stored up grain [^am]in great abundance like the sand of the sea, until he stopped [^an]measuring _it_, for it was [^ao]beyond measure. ## The Sons of Joseph 







###### 50 



Now before the year of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of [^ap]On, bore to him. 







###### 51 



Joseph named the firstborn [^aq]Manasseh; "For," _he said_, "God has made me forget all my trouble and all of my father's household." 







###### 52 



And he named the second [^ar]Ephraim; "For," _he said_, "God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction." 







###### 53 



When the seven years of plenty which had taken place in the land of Egypt came to an end, 







###### 54 



and the seven years of famine began to come, just as Joseph had said, then there was famine in all the lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread. 







###### 55 



So when all the land of Egypt suffered famine, the people cried out to Pharaoh for bread; and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, "Go to Joseph; whatever he says to you, you shall do." 







###### 56 



When the famine was _spread_ over the entire face of the earth, then Joseph opened all [^as]the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians; and the famine was severe in the land of Egypt. 







###### 57 



Then _the people of_ all the earth came to Egypt to buy grain from Joseph, because the famine was severe in all the earth. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

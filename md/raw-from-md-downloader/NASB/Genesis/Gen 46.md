# Genesis 46

***








###### 1 



So Israel set out with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac. 







###### 2 



And God spoke to Israel [^a]in visions of the night and said, "Jacob, Jacob." And he said, "Here I am." 







###### 3 



Then He said, "I am God, the God of your father; do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will make you into a great nation there. 







###### 4 



I will go down with you to Egypt, and I will also assuredly bring you up again; and Joseph will [^b]close your eyes." 







###### 5 



Then Jacob left Beersheba, and the sons of Israel carried their father Jacob and their little ones and their wives in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him. 







###### 6 



They also took their livestock and their possessions, which they had acquired in the land of Canaan, and came to Egypt, Jacob and all his [^c]descendants with him: 







###### 7 



his sons and his grandsons with him, his daughters and his granddaughters, and all his [^d]descendants he brought with him to Egypt. ## Those Who Came to Egypt 







###### 8 



Now these are the names of the sons of Israel who went to Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn. 







###### 9 



And the sons of Reuben: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. 







###### 10 



And the sons of Simeon: [^e]Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, [^f]Jachin, [^g]Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman. 







###### 11 



And the sons of Levi: [^h]Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 







###### 12 



And the sons of Judah: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah (but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan). And the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul. 







###### 13 



And the sons of Issachar: Tola, [^i]Puvvah, [^j]Iob, and Shimron. 







###### 14 



And the sons of Zebulun: Sered, Elon, and Jahleel. 







###### 15 



These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan-aram, with his daughter Dinah; [^k]all his sons and his daughters _numbered_ thirty-three. 







###### 16 



And the sons of Gad: [^l]Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, [^m]Ezbon, Eri, [^n]Arodi, and Areli. 







###### 17 



And the sons of Asher: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah, and their sister Serah. And the sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel. 







###### 18 



These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Leah; and she bore to Jacob these sixteen persons. 







###### 19 



The sons of Jacob's wife Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin. 







###### 20 



Now to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, bore to him. 







###### 21 



And the sons of Benjamin: Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, [^o]Ehi, Rosh, [^p]Muppim, [^q]Huppim, and Ard. 







###### 22 



These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob; _there were_ fourteen persons in all. 







###### 23 



And the sons of Dan: [^r]Hushim. 







###### 24 



And the sons of Naphtali: [^s]Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and [^t]Shillem. 







###### 25 



These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Rachel, and she bore these to Jacob; _there were_ seven persons in all. 







###### 26 



All the people belonging to Jacob, who came to Egypt, [^u]his direct descendants, not including the wives of Jacob's sons, _were_ sixty-six persons in all, 







###### 27 



and the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were [^v]two; all the people of the house of Jacob, who came to Egypt, _were_ seventy. 







###### 28 



Now _Jacob_ sent Judah ahead of him to Joseph, to [^w]guide him to Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen. 







###### 29 



And Joseph [^x]prepared his chariot and went up to Goshen to meet his father Israel; as soon as he appeared to him, _Joseph_ threw himself on his neck and wept on his neck a long time. 







###### 30 



Then Israel said to Joseph, "Now let me die, since I have seen your face, that you are still alive." 







###### 31 



But Joseph said to his brothers and to his father's household, "I will go up and tell Pharaoh, and will say to him, 'My brothers and my father's household, who _were_ in the land of Canaan, have come to me; 







###### 32 



and the men are shepherds, for they have been [^y]keepers of livestock; and they have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they have.' 







###### 33 



When Pharaoh calls for you and says, 'What is your occupation?' 







###### 34 



you shall say, 'Your servants have been [^z]keepers of livestock since our youth even until now, both we and our fathers,' so that you may live in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

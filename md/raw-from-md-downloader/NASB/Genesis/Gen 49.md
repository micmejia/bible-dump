# Genesis 49

***








###### 1 



Then Jacob summoned his sons and said, "Assemble yourselves, so that I may tell you what will happen to you in the [^a]days to come. 







###### 2 



Gather together and listen, sons of Jacob; Yes, listen to Israel your father. 







###### 3 



"Reuben, you are my firstborn, My might and the beginning of my strength, Preeminent in dignity and preeminent in power. 







###### 4 



[^b]Uncontrollable as water, you shall not have preeminence, Because you went up to your father's bed; Then you defiled _it_--he went up to my couch. 







###### 5 



"Simeon and Levi are brothers; Their [^c]swords are implements of violence. 







###### 6 



May my soul not enter into their council; May my glory not be united with their assembly; For in their anger they killed [^d]men, And in their self-will they lamed [^e]oxen. 







###### 7 



Cursed be their anger, for it is fierce; And their wrath, for it is cruel. I will scatter them in Jacob, And disperse them among Israel. 







###### 8 



"As for you, Judah, your brothers shall praise you; Your hand shall be on the neck of your enemies; Your father's sons shall bow down to you. 







###### 9 



Judah is a lion's cub; From the prey, my son, you have gone up. He [^f]crouches, he lies down as a lion, And as a [^g]lion, who [^h]dares to stir him up? 







###### 10 



The scepter will not depart from Judah, Nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, [^i]Until Shiloh comes, And to him _shall be_ the obedience of the peoples. 







###### 11 



He ties _his_ foal to the vine, And his donkey's colt to the choice vine; He washes his garments in wine, And his robes in the blood of grapes. 







###### 12 



His eyes are [^j]dull from wine, And his teeth [^k]white from milk. 







###### 13 



"Zebulun will reside at the seashore; And he _shall be_ [^l]a harbor for ships, And his flank _shall be_ toward Sidon. 







###### 14 



"Issachar is a [^m]strong donkey, Lying down between the sheepfolds. 







###### 15 



When he saw that a resting place was good And that the land was pleasant, He bowed his shoulder to carry _burdens_, And became a slave at forced labor. 







###### 16 



"Dan shall judge his people, As one of the tribes of Israel. 







###### 17 



Dan shall be a serpent in the way, A horned viper in the path, That bites the horse's heels, So that its rider falls backward. 







###### 18 



For Your salvation I wait, LORD. 







###### 19 



"As for Gad, a band of raiders shall attack him, But he will attack _at_ their [^n]heels. 







###### 20 



"[^o]As for Asher, his [^p]food shall be [^q]rich, And he will yield royal delicacies. 







###### 21 



"Naphtali is a doe let loose; He utters beautiful words. 







###### 22 



"Joseph is a fruitful [^r]branch, A fruitful [^s]branch by a spring; _Its_ [^t]branches hang over a wall. 







###### 23 



The archers provoked him, And shot _at him_ and were hostile toward him; 







###### 24 



But his bow remained [^u]firm, And [^v]his arms were agile, From the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob (From there is the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel), 







###### 25 



From the God of your father who helps you, And [^w]by the [^x]Almighty who blesses you _With_ blessings of heaven above, Blessings of the deep that lies beneath, Blessings of the breasts and of the womb. 







###### 26 



The blessings of your father Have surpassed the blessings of my ancestors Up to the [^y]furthest boundary of the everlasting hills; May they be on the head of Joseph, And on the top of the head of the one distinguished among his brothers. 







###### 27 



"Benjamin is a [^z]ravenous wolf; In the morning he devours the prey, And in the evening he divides the spoils." 







###### 28 



All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father said to them [^aa]when he blessed them. He blessed them, every one [^ab]with the blessing appropriate to him. ## Jacob Dies 







###### 29 



Then he commanded them and said to them, "I am about to be gathered to my people; bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite, 







###### 30 



in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is opposite Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought along with the field from Ephron the Hittite as a [^ac]burial site. 







###### 31 



There they buried Abraham and his wife Sarah, there they buried Isaac and his wife Rebekah, and there I buried Leah-- 







###### 32 



the field and the cave that is in it, purchased from the sons of Heth." 







###### 33 



When Jacob finished commanding his sons, he drew his feet into the bed and breathed his last, and was gathered to his people. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

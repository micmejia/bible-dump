# Genesis 7

***








###### 1 



Then the LORD said to Noah, "Enter the ark, you and all your household, for you _alone_ I have seen _to be_ righteous before Me in this generation. 







###### 2 



You shall take [^a]with you [^b]seven pairs of every clean animal, a male and his female; and two of the animals that are not clean, a male and his female; 







###### 3 



also of the birds of the sky, [^c]seven pairs, male and female, to keep _their_ [^d]offspring alive on the face of all the earth. 







###### 4 



For after seven more days, I will send rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights; and I will wipe out from the face of the land every living thing that I have made." 







###### 5 



So Noah acted in accordance with everything that the LORD had commanded him. 







###### 6 



Now Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of water [^e]came upon the earth. 







###### 7 



Then Noah and his sons, his wife, and his sons' wives with him entered the ark because of the waters of the flood. 







###### 8 



Of clean animals and animals that are not clean and birds and everything that crawls on the ground, 







###### 9 



they _all_ went into the ark to Noah [^f]by twos, male and female, as God had commanded Noah. 







###### 10 



Now it came about after the seven days, that the waters of the flood [^g]came upon the earth. 







###### 11 



In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep burst open, and the [^h]floodgates of the sky were opened. 







###### 12 



The rain [^i]fell upon the earth for forty days and forty nights. 







###### 13 



On this very same day Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife and the three wives of his sons with them, entered the ark, 







###### 14 



they and every animal according to its kind, and all the livestock according to [^j]their kind, and every crawling thing that crawls on the earth according to its kind, and every bird according to its kind, [^k]all sorts of birds. 







###### 15 



So they went into the ark to Noah, by twos of all flesh in which there was the breath of life. 







###### 16 



Those that entered, male and female of all flesh, entered as God had commanded him; and the LORD closed _the door_ behind him. 







###### 17 



Then the flood [^l]came upon the earth for forty days, and the water increased and lifted up the ark, so that it rose above the earth. 







###### 18 



The water prevailed and increased greatly upon the earth, and the ark [^m]floated on the [^n]surface of the water. 







###### 19 



And the water prevailed more and more upon the earth, so that all the high mountains [^o]everywhere under the heavens were covered. 







###### 20 



The water prevailed [^p]fifteen cubits higher, and the mountains were covered. 







###### 21 



So all [^q]creatures that moved on the earth perished: birds, livestock, animals, and every swarming thing that swarms upon the earth, and all mankind; 







###### 22 



of all that was on the dry land, all in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, died. 







###### 23 



So He wiped out [^r]every living thing that was upon the face of the land, from mankind to animals, to crawling things, and the birds of the sky, and they were wiped out from the earth; and only Noah was left, together with those that were with him in the ark. 







###### 24 



The water prevailed upon the earth for 150 days. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Genesis 8

***








###### 1 



But God remembered Noah and all the animals and all the livestock that were with him in the ark; and God caused a wind to pass over the earth, and the water subsided. 







###### 2 



Also the fountains of the deep and the [^a]floodgates of the sky were closed, and the rain from the sky was restrained; 







###### 3 



and the water receded steadily from the earth, and at the end of 150 days the water decreased. 







###### 4 



Then in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, the ark rested upon the mountains of Ararat. 







###### 5 



And the water decreased steadily until the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains became visible. 







###### 6 



Then it came about at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made; 







###### 7 



and he sent out a raven, and it [^b]flew here and there until the water was dried up [^c]from the earth. 







###### 8 



Then he sent out a [^d]dove, to see if the water was low on the [^e]surface of the land; 







###### 9 



but the dove found no resting place for the sole of its foot, so it returned to him in the ark, for the water was on the [^f]surface of all the earth. Then he put out his hand and took it, and brought it into the ark to himself. 







###### 10 



So he waited another seven days longer; and again he sent out the dove from the ark. 







###### 11 



And the dove came to him in [^g]the evening, and behold, in its [^h]beak was a fresh olive leaf. So Noah knew that the water was low on the earth. 







###### 12 



Then he waited another seven days longer, and sent out the dove; but it did not return to him again. 







###### 13 



Now it came about in the six hundred and first year, in the first _month_, on the first of the month, _that_ the water was dried up [^i]from the earth. Then Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and behold, the [^j]surface of the ground had dried up. 







###### 14 



And in the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry. 







###### 15 



Then God spoke to Noah, saying, 







###### 16 



"Go out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and your sons' wives with you. 







###### 17 



Bring out with you every living thing of all flesh that is with you, birds and animals and every crawling thing that crawls on the earth, that they may [^k]breed abundantly on the earth, and be fruitful and multiply on the earth." 







###### 18 



So Noah went out, and his sons and his wife, and his sons' wives with him. 







###### 19 



Every animal, every crawling thing, and every bird, everything that moves on the earth, went out [^l]by their families from the ark. 







###### 20 



Then Noah built an altar to the LORD, and took some of every _kind of_ clean animal and some of every clean bird and offered burnt offerings on the altar. 







###### 21 



The LORD smelled the soothing aroma, and the LORD said [^m]to Himself, "I will never again curse the ground on account of man, for the [^n]intent of man's heart is evil from his youth; and I will never again [^o]destroy every living thing, as I have done. 







###### 22 



While the earth remains, Seedtime and harvest, Cold and heat, Summer and winter, And day and night Shall not cease." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

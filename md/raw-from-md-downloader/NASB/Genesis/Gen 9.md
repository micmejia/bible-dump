# Genesis 9

***








###### 1 



Then God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth. 







###### 2 



The fear of you and the terror of you will be on every animal of the earth and on every bird of the sky; on everything that crawls on the ground, and on all the fish of the sea. They are handed over to you. 







###### 3 



Every moving thing that is alive shall be food for you; I have given everything to you, as _I gave_ the green plant. 







###### 4 



But you shall not eat flesh with its life, _that is_, its blood. 







###### 5 



I certainly will require [^a]your lifeblood; [^b]from every animal I will require it. And [^c]from _every_ person, [^d]from every man _as_ his brother I will require the life of a person. 







###### 6 



Whoever sheds human blood, By man his blood shall be shed, For in the image of God He made mankind. 







###### 7 



As for you, be fruitful and multiply; [^e]Populate the earth abundantly and multiply in it." 







###### 8 



Then God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him, saying, 







###### 9 



"Now behold, I Myself am establishing My covenant with you, and with your [^f]descendants after you; 







###### 10 



and with every living creature that is with you: the birds, the livestock, and every animal of the earth with you; of all that comes out of the ark, every animal of the earth. 







###### 11 



I establish My covenant with you; and all flesh shall never again be eliminated by the waters of a flood, nor shall there again be a flood to destroy the earth." 







###### 12 



God said, "This is the sign of the covenant which I am making between Me and you and every living creature that is with you, for [^g]all future generations; 







###### 13 



I have set My rainbow in the cloud, and it shall [^h]serve as a sign of a covenant between Me and the earth. 







###### 14 



It shall come about, when I make a cloud appear over the earth, that the rainbow will be seen in the cloud, 







###### 15 



and I will remember My covenant, which is between Me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and never again shall the water become a flood to destroy all flesh. 







###### 16 



When the rainbow is in the cloud, then I will look at it, to remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth." 







###### 17 



And God said to Noah, "This is the sign of the covenant which I have established between Me and all flesh that is on the earth." 







###### 18 



Now the sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and Ham was the father of Canaan. 







###### 19 



These three _were_ the sons of Noah, and from these the whole earth was [^i]populated. 







###### 20 



Then Noah began [^j]farming and planted a vineyard. 







###### 21 



He drank some of the wine and became drunk, and uncovered himself inside his tent. 







###### 22 



Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside. 







###### 23 



But Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it on both their shoulders and walked backward and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were [^k]turned away, so that they did not see their father's nakedness. 







###### 24 



When Noah awoke from his wine, he knew what his youngest son had done to him. 







###### 25 



So he said, "Cursed be Canaan; [^l]A servant of servants He shall be to his brothers." 







###### 26 



He also said, "Blessed be the LORD, The God of Shem; And may Canaan be [^m]his servant. 







###### 27 



May God enlarge Japheth, And may he live in the tents of Shem; And may Canaan be [^n]his servant." 







###### 28 



Noah lived 350 years after the flood. 







###### 29 



So all the days of Noah were 950 years, and he died. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Habakkuk 1

***








###### 1 



The pronouncement which Habakkuk the prophet saw: 







###### 2 



How long, LORD, have I called for help, And You do not hear? I cry out to You, "Violence!" Yet You do not save. 







###### 3 



Why do You make me see disaster, And make _me_ look at destitution? Yes, devastation and violence are before me; Strife exists and contention arises. 







###### 4 



Therefore the Law [^a]is ignored, And justice [^b]is never upheld. For the wicked surround the righteous; Therefore justice comes out confused. 







###### 5 



"Look among the nations! Watch! Be horrified! Be frightened speechless! For _I am_ accomplishing a work in your days-- You would not believe _it even_ if [^c]you were told! 







###### 6 



For behold, I am raising up the Chaldeans, That [^d]grim and impetuous people Who march [^e]throughout the earth, To take possession of dwelling places that are not theirs. 







###### 7 



They are terrifying and feared; Their justice and [^f]authority [^g]originate with themselves. 







###### 8 



Their horses are faster than leopards, And quicker than wolves in the evening. Their [^h]horsemen charge along, Their [^i]horsemen come from afar; They fly like an eagle [^j]swooping down to devour. 







###### 9 



All of them come for violence. [^k]Their horde of faces moves forward. They gather captives like sand. 







###### 10 



They make fun of kings, And dignitaries are _an object of_ laughter to them. They laugh at every fortress, Then heap up dirt and [^l]capture it. 







###### 11 



Then they fly along _like_ the wind and pass on. But they will be held guilty, They whose strength is their god." 







###### 12 



Are You not from time everlasting, LORD, my God, my Holy One? We will not die. You, LORD, have appointed them to _deliver_ judgment; And You, O Rock, have destined them to punish. 







###### 13 



_Your_ eyes are too pure to look at evil, And You cannot look at harm _favorably_. Why do You look _favorably_ At those who deal treacherously? _Why_ are You silent when the wicked swallow up Those more righteous than they? 







###### 14 



_Why_ have You made people like the fish of the sea, Like crawling things that have no ruler over them? 







###### 15 



_The Chaldeans_ bring all of them up with a hook, Drag them away with their net, And gather them together in their fishing net. Therefore they rejoice and are joyful. 







###### 16 



Therefore they offer a sacrifice to their net And [^m]burn incense to their fishing net, Because through these things their [^n]catch is [^o]large, And their food is [^p]plentiful. 







###### 17 



Will they therefore empty their net, And continually slay nations without sparing? ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

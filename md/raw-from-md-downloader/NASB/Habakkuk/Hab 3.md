# Habakkuk 3

***








###### 1 



A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, according to [^a]Shigionoth. 







###### 2 



LORD, I have heard [^b]the report about You, _and_ [^c]I was afraid. LORD, revive Your work in the midst of the years, In the midst of the years make _it_ known. In anger remember [^d]mercy. 







###### 3 



God comes from Teman, And the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah His splendor covers the heavens, And the earth is full of His praise. 







###### 4 



_His_ radiance is like the sunlight; He has rays _flashing_ from His hand, And the hiding of His might is there. 







###### 5 



Before Him goes plague, And plague comes forth [^e]after Him. 







###### 6 



He stood and caused the earth to shudder; He looked and caused the nations to jump. Yes, the everlasting mountains were shattered, The ancient hills [^f]collapsed. His paths are everlasting. 







###### 7 



I saw the tents of Cushan under distress, The tent curtains of the land of Midian were trembling. 







###### 8 



Did the LORD rage against the rivers, Or _was_ Your anger against the rivers, Or _was_ Your rage against the sea, That You rode on Your horses, On Your chariots of salvation? 







###### 9 



You removed Your bow _from its holder_, The arrows of _Your_ word were [^g]sworn. Selah You divided the earth with rivers. 







###### 10 



The mountains saw You _and_ quaked; The downpour of waters swept by. The deep raised its voice, It lifted high its hands. 







###### 11 



Sun _and_ moon stood in their lofty places; They went away at the light of Your arrows, At the radiance of Your flashing spear. 







###### 12 



In indignation You marched through the earth; In anger You [^h]trampled the nations. 







###### 13 



You went forth for the salvation of Your people, For the salvation of Your anointed. You smashed the head of the house of evil To uncover _him from_ [^i]foot to neck. Selah 







###### 14 



You pierced with his own [^j]arrows The head of his [^k]leaders. They stormed in to scatter [^l]us; Their arrogance _was_ like those Who devour the oppressed in secret. 







###### 15 



You trampled on the sea with Your horses, On the foam of many waters. 







###### 16 



I heard, and my [^m]inner parts trembled; At the sound, my lips quivered. Decay enters my bones, And in my place I tremble; Because I [^n]must wait quietly for the day of distress, [^o]For the people to arise _who_ will attack us. 







###### 17 



Even if the fig tree does not blossom, And there is no [^p]fruit on the vines, _If_ the yield of the olive fails, And the fields produce no food, _Even if_ the flock disappears from the fold, And there are no cattle in the stalls, 







###### 18 



Yet I will triumph in the LORD, I will rejoice in the God of my salvation. 







###### 19 



The Lord [^q]God is my strength, And He has made my feet like deer's _feet_, And has me walk on my high places. For the choir director, on my stringed instruments. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

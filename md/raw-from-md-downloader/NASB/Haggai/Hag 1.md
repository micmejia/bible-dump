# Haggai 1

***








###### 1 



In the second year of Darius the king, on the first day of the sixth month, the word of the LORD came by the prophet Haggai to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, saying, 







###### 2 



"This is what the LORD of armies [^a]says: 'This people says, "The time has not come, the time for the house of the LORD to be rebuilt."'" 







###### 3 



Then the word of the LORD came by Haggai the prophet, saying, 







###### 4 



"Is it time for you yourselves to live in your paneled houses while this house _remains_ desolate?" 







###### 5

###### 6 



You have sown much, _only to_ [^c]harvest little; _you_ eat, but there is not _enough_ to be satisfied; _you_ drink, but there is not _enough_ to become drunk; _you_ put on clothing, but there is not _enough_ for [^d]anyone to get warm; and the one who earns, earns wages _to put_ into a money bag full of holes."

Then Haggai, the messenger of the LORD, spoke [^l]by the commission of the LORD to the people, saying, "'I am with you,' declares the LORD." 







###### 14 



So the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and worked on the house of the LORD of armies, their God,

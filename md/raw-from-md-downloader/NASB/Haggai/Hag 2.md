# Haggai 2

***








###### 1 



On the twenty-first of the seventh month, the word of the LORD came by Haggai the prophet, saying, 







###### 2 



"Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, saying, 







###### 3 



'Who is left among you who saw this [^a]temple in its former glory? And how do you see it now? [^b]Does it not seem to you like nothing [^c]in comparison? 







###### 4 



But now [^d]take courage, Zerubbabel,' declares the LORD, 'take courage also, Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and all you people of the land take courage,' declares the LORD, 'and work; for I am with you,' declares the LORD of armies. 







###### 5 



'As for the [^e]promise which I [^f]made you when you came out of Egypt, [^g]My Spirit remains in your midst; do not fear!' 







###### 6 



For this is what the LORD of armies says: 'Once more [^h]in a little while, I am going to shake the heavens and the earth, the sea also and the dry land. 







###### 7 



I will shake all the nations; and [^i]they will come _with_ the wealth of all nations, and I will fill this house with glory,' says the LORD of armies. 







###### 8 



'The silver is Mine and the gold is Mine,' declares the LORD of armies. 







###### 9 



'The latter glory of this house will be greater than the former,' says the LORD of armies, 'and in this place I will give peace,' declares the LORD of armies." 







###### 10 



On the twenty-fourth of the ninth _month_, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Haggai the prophet, saying, 







###### 11 



"The LORD of armies says this: 'Now ask the priests _for_ a [^j]ruling: 







###### 12 



If someone carries holy meat in the [^k]fold of his garment, and touches bread with [^l]this fold, or _touches_ cooked food, wine, oil, or any _other_ food, will it become holy?'" And the priests answered, "No." 







###### 13 



Then Haggai said, "If one who is unclean from a [^m]corpse touches any of these _things_, will _the latter_ become unclean?" And the priests answered, "It will become unclean." 







###### 14 



Then Haggai responded and said, "'So is this people. And so is this nation before Me,' declares the LORD, 'and so is every work of their hands; and what they offer there is unclean. 







###### 15 



But now, do [^n]consider from this day [^o]onward: before one stone was placed on another in the temple of the LORD, 







###### 16 



[^p]from that time _when_ one came to a grain heap of twenty _measures_, there would be _only_ ten; _and when_ one came to the wine vat to draw fifty [^q]measures, there would be _only_ twenty. 







###### 17 



I struck you _and_ every work of your hands with scorching wind, mildew, and hail; [^r]yet you did not come back to Me,' declares the LORD. 







###### 18 



'Do [^s]consider from this day [^t]onward, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth _month_; from the day when the temple of the LORD was founded, [^u]consider: 







###### 19 



Is the seed still in the barn? Even including the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate, and the olive tree, it has not produced _fruit. Yet_ from this day _on_ I will bless _you_.'" 







###### 20 



Then the word of the LORD came a second time to Haggai on the twenty-fourth _day_ of the month, saying, 







###### 21 



"Speak to Zerubbabel governor of Judah, saying, 'I am going to shake the heavens and the earth. 







###### 22 



And I will overthrow the thrones of kingdoms and destroy the power of the kingdoms of the [^v]nations; and I will overthrow the chariots and their riders, and the horses and their riders will go down, every one by the sword of another.' 







###### 23 



'On that day,' declares the LORD of armies, 'I will take you, Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, My servant,' declares the LORD, 'and I will make you like a [^w]signet ring, for I have chosen you,'" declares the LORD of armies. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

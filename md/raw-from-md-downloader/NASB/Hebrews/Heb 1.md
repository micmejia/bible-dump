# Hebrews 1

***








###### 1 



God, after He spoke long ago to the fathers in the prophets in many portions and in many ways, 







###### 2 



[^a]in these last days has spoken to us [^b]in _His_ Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, through whom He also made the [^c]world. 







###### 3 



[^d]And He is the radiance of His glory and the exact representation of His nature, and [^e]upholds all things by [^f]the word of His power. When He had made purification of sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, 







###### 4 



having become so much better than the angels, to the extent that He has inherited a more excellent name than they. 







###### 5 



For to which of the angels did He ever say, "You are My Son, Today I have fathered You"? And again, "I will be a Father to Him And He will be a Son to Me"? 







###### 6 



And [^g]when He again brings the firstborn into [^h]the world, He says, "And let all the angels of God worship Him." 







###### 7 



And regarding the angels He says, "He makes His angels winds, And His ministers a flame of fire." 







###### 8

###### 9 



You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; Therefore God, Your God, has anointed You With the oil of joy above Your companions." 







###### 10 



And, "You, Lord, in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth, And the heavens are the works of Your hands; 







###### 11 



They will perish, but You remain; And they all will [^j]wear out like a garment, 







###### 12 



And like a robe You will roll them up; Like a garment they will also be changed. But You are the same, And Your years will not come to an end." 







###### 13 



But to which of the angels has He ever said, "Sit at My right hand, Until I make Your enemies A footstool for Your feet"? 







###### 14 



Are they not all ministering spirits, sent out to _provide_ service for the sake of those who will inherit salvation? ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Hebrews 11

***








###### 1 



Now faith is _the_ certainty of _things_ [^a]hoped for, a [^b]proof of things not seen. 







###### 2 



For by it the people of old [^c]gained approval. 







###### 3 



By faith we understand that the [^d]world has been created by the word of God so that what is seen has not been made out of things that are visible. 







###### 4 



By faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain, through which he was attested to be righteous, God testifying [^e]about his gifts, and through [^f]faith, though he is dead, he still speaks. 







###### 5 



By faith Enoch was taken up so that he would not see death; and he was not found because God took him up; for before he was taken up, he was attested to have been pleasing to God. 







###### 6 



And without faith it is impossible to please _Him_, for the one who comes to God must believe that He exists, and _that_ He proves to be One who rewards those who seek Him. 







###### 7 



By faith Noah, being warned _by God_ about things not yet seen, [^g]in reverence prepared an ark for the salvation of his household, by which he condemned the world, and became an heir of the righteousness which is according to faith. 







###### 8 



By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed [^h]by going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he left, not knowing where he was going. 







###### 9 



By faith he lived as a stranger in the land of promise, as _in_ a foreign _land_, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow heirs of the same promise; 







###### 10 



for he was looking for the city which has foundations, whose architect and builder is God. 







###### 11 



By faith even Sarah herself received [^i]ability to conceive, even beyond _the_ proper time of life, since she considered Him faithful who had promised. 







###### 12 



Therefore even from one man, and one who was _as good as_ dead [^j]at that, there were born _descendants who were_ just as the stars of heaven in number, and as the innumerable _grains of_ sand along the seashore. 







###### 13 



All these died in faith, without receiving the promises, but having seen and welcomed them from a distance, and having confessed that they were strangers and exiles on the earth. 







###### 14 



For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own. 







###### 15 



And indeed if they had been [^k]thinking of that _country_ which they left, they would have had opportunity to return. 







###### 16 



But as it is, they desire a better _country_, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not [^l]ashamed to be called their God; for He has prepared a city for them. 







###### 17 



By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and the one who had received the promises was offering up his [^m]only _son_; 







###### 18 



_it was he_ to whom it was said, "Through Isaac your [^n]descendants shall be named." 







###### 19 



[^o]He considered that God is able to raise _people_ even from the dead, from which he also received him back [^p]as a [^q]type. 







###### 20 



By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even regarding things to come. 







###### 21 



By faith Jacob, as he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped, _leaning_ on the top of his staff. 







###### 22 



By faith Joseph, when he was dying, made mention of the exodus of the sons of Israel, and gave orders concerning his bones. 







###### 23 



By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw he was a beautiful child; and they were not afraid of the king's edict. 







###### 24 



By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, 







###### 25 



choosing rather to endure ill-treatment with the people of God than to enjoy the temporary pleasures of sin, 







###### 26 



considering the [^r]reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he was looking to the reward. 







###### 27 



By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he persevered, as though seeing Him who is unseen. 







###### 28 



By faith he [^s]kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch them. 







###### 29 



By faith they passed through the Red Sea as through dry land; and the Egyptians, when they attempted it, were [^t]drowned. 







###### 30 



By faith the walls of Jericho fell down [^u]after _the Israelites_ had marched around them for seven days. 







###### 31 



By faith the prostitute Rahab did not perish along with those who were disobedient, after she had welcomed the spies [^v]in peace. 







###### 32 



And what more shall I say? For time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets, 







###### 33 



who by faith conquered kingdoms, performed _acts of_ righteousness, obtained promises, shut the mouths of lions, 







###### 34 



quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight. 







###### 35 



Women received _back_ their dead by resurrection; and others were tortured, not accepting their [^w]release, so that they might obtain a better resurrection; 







###### 36 



and others [^x]experienced mocking and flogging, and further, chains and imprisonment. 







###### 37 



They were stoned, they were sawn in two, [^y]they were tempted, they were put to death with the sword; they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented 







###### 38 



(_people_ of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts, _on_ mountains, and _sheltering in_ caves and holes [^z]in the ground. 







###### 39 



And all these, having gained approval through their faith, did not receive [^aa]what was promised, 







###### 40 



because God had [^ab]provided something better for us, so that apart from us they would not be made perfect. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

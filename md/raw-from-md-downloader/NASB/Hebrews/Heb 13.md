# Hebrews 13

***








###### 1 



Let love of the brothers _and_ sisters continue. 







###### 2 



Do not neglect hospitality to strangers, for by this some have entertained angels without knowing it. 







###### 3 



Remember the prisoners, as though in prison with them, _and_ those who are badly treated, since you yourselves also are in the body. 







###### 4 



Marriage _is to be held_ in honor among all, and the _marriage_ bed _is to be_ undefiled; for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterers. 







###### 5 



_Make sure that_ your character is free from the love of money, being content with what you have; for He Himself has said, "I will never desert you, nor will I ever abandon you," 







###### 6 



so that we confidently say, "The Lord is my helper, I will not be afraid. What will man do to me?" 







###### 7 



Remember those who led you, who spoke the word of God to you; and considering the [^a]result of their way of life, imitate their faith. 







###### 8 



Jesus Christ _is_ the same yesterday and today, and forever. 







###### 9 



Do not be misled by varied and strange teachings; for it is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace, not by foods, through which those who [^b]were so occupied were not benefited. 







###### 10 



We have an altar from which those who serve the [^c]tabernacle have no right to eat. 







###### 11 



For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the Holy Place by the high priest _as an offering_ for sin are burned outside the camp. 







###### 12 



Therefore Jesus also suffered outside the gate, that He might sanctify the people through His own blood. 







###### 13 



So then, let us go out to Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach. 







###### 14 



For here we do not have a lasting city, but we are seeking _the city_ which is to come. ## God-pleasing Sacrifices 







###### 15 



Through Him then, let's continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips praising His name. 







###### 16 



And do not neglect doing good and sharing, for with such sacrifices God is pleased. 







###### 17 



Obey your leaders and submit _to them_--for they keep watch over your souls as those who will give an account--so that they may do this with joy, not [^d]groaning; for this _would be_ unhelpful for you. 







###### 18 



Pray for us, for we are sure that we have a good conscience, desiring to conduct ourselves honorably in all things. 







###### 19 



And I urge _you_ all the more to do this, so that I may be restored to you more quickly. ## Benediction 







###### 20 



Now may the God of peace, who brought up from the dead the great Shepherd of the sheep [^e]through the blood of the eternal covenant, _that is_, Jesus our Lord, 







###### 21 



equip you in every good thing to do His will, working in us that which is pleasing in His sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom _be_ the glory forever and ever. Amen. 







###### 22 



But I urge you, brothers _and sisters_, [^f]listen patiently to [^g]this word of exhortation, for I have written to you briefly. 







###### 23 



Know that our brother Timothy has been released, with whom, if he comes soon, I will see you. 







###### 24 



Greet all of your leaders and all the [^h]saints. Those from Italy greet you. 







###### 25 



Grace be with you all. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

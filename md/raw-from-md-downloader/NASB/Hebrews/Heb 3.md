# Hebrews 3

***








###### 1 



Therefore, holy brothers _and sisters_, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession: Jesus; 







###### 2 



[^a]He was faithful to Him who appointed Him, as Moses also was in all His house. 







###### 3 



For He has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by just so much as the builder of the house has more honor than the house. 







###### 4 



For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God. 







###### 5 



Now Moses was faithful in all [^b]God's house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken _later_; 







###### 6 



but Christ _was faithful_ as a Son over His house--whose house we are, if we hold firmly to our confidence and the boast of our [^c]hope. 







###### 7 



Therefore, just as the Holy Spirit says, "Today if you hear His voice, 







###### 8 



Do not harden your hearts as [^d]when they provoked Me, As on the day of trial in the wilderness, 







###### 9 



Where your fathers put _M__e_ to the test, And saw My works for forty years. 







###### 10 



Therefore I was angry with this generation, And said, 'They always go astray in their heart, And they did not know My ways'; 







###### 11 



As I swore in My anger, 'They certainly shall not enter My rest.'" ## The Danger of Unbelief 







###### 12 



Take care, brothers _and sisters_, that there will not be in any one of you an evil, unbelieving heart [^e]that falls away from the living God. 







###### 13 



But encourage one another every day, as long as it is _still_ called "today," so that none of you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. 







###### 14 



For we have become partakers of Christ if we keep the beginning of our [^f]commitment firm until the end, 







###### 15 



while it is said, "Today if you hear His voice, Do not harden your hearts, as [^g]when they provoked Me." 







###### 16 



For who provoked _Him_ when they had heard? Indeed, did not all those who came out of Egypt _led_ by Moses? 







###### 17 



And with whom was He angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose dead bodies fell in the wilderness? 







###### 18 



And to whom did He swear that they would not enter His rest, but to those who were disobedient? 







###### 19 



And _so_ we see that they were not able to enter because of unbelief. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

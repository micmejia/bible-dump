# Hebrews 4

***








###### 1 



Therefore, we must fear if, while a promise remains of entering His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short _of it_. 







###### 2 



For indeed we have had good news preached to us, just as they also _did_; but the word [^a]they heard did not benefit them, because [^b]they were not united with those who listened with faith. 







###### 3 



For we who have believed enter _that_ rest, just as He has said, "As I swore in My anger, They certainly shall not enter My rest," although His works were finished from the foundation of the world. 







###### 4 



For He has said somewhere concerning the seventh _day_: "And God rested on the seventh day from all His works"; 







###### 5 



and again in this _passage_, "They certainly shall not enter My rest." 







###### 6 



Therefore, since it remains for some to enter it, and those who previously had good news preached to them failed to enter because of disobedience, 







###### 7 



He again sets a certain day, "Today," saying [^c]through David after so long a time just as has been said before, "Today if you hear His voice, Do not harden your hearts." 







###### 8 



For if [^d]Joshua had given them rest, He would not have spoken of another day after that. 







###### 9 



Consequently, there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God. 







###### 10 



For the one who has entered His rest has himself also rested from his works, as God did from His. 







###### 11 



Therefore let's make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will fall by _following_ the same example of disobedience. 







###### 12 



For the word of God is living and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, even penetrating as far as the division of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able to [^e]judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart. 







###### 13 



And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of Him to whom [^f]we must answer. 







###### 14 



Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let's hold firmly to our confession. 







###### 15 



For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things just as _we are, yet_ without sin. 







###### 16 



Therefore let's approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace for help at the time of _our_ need. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Hebrews 5

***








###### 1 



For every high priest taken from among men is appointed on behalf of people in things pertaining to God, in order to offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins; 







###### 2 



[^a]he can deal gently with the ignorant and misguided, since he himself also is [^b]clothed in weakness; 







###### 3 



and because of it he is obligated to offer _sacrifices_ for sins for himself, as well as for the people. 







###### 4 



And no one takes the honor for himself, but _receives it_ when he is called by God, just as Aaron also was. 







###### 5 



So too Christ did not glorify Himself _in_ becoming a high priest, but _it was_ He who said to Him, "You are My Son, Today I have fathered You"; 







###### 6 



just as He also says in another _passage_, "You are a priest forever According to the order of Melchizedek." 







###### 7 



In the days of [^c]His humanity, [^d]He offered up both prayers and pleas with loud crying and tears to the One able to save Him [^e]from death, and He [^f]was heard because of His devout behavior. 







###### 8 



Although He was a Son, He learned obedience from the things which He suffered. 







###### 9 



And having been perfected, He became the source of eternal salvation for all those who obey Him, 







###### 10 



being designated by God as High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek. 







###### 11 



Concerning [^g]him we have much to say, and _it is_ difficult to explain, since you have become [^h]poor listeners. 







###### 12 



For though [^i]by this time you ought to be teachers, you have need again for someone to teach you the [^j]elementary principles of the actual words of God, and you have come to need milk and not solid food. 







###### 13 



For everyone who partakes _only_ of milk is unacquainted with the word of righteousness, for he is an infant. 







###### 14 



But solid food is for the mature, who because of practice have their senses trained to distinguish between good and evil. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

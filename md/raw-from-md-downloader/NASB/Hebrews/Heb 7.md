# Hebrews 7

***








###### 1 



For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham as he was returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, 







###### 2 



to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth of all _the spoils_, was first of all, by the translation _of his name_, king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, which is king of peace. 







###### 3 



Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, he remains a priest perpetually. 







###### 4 



Now observe how great this man was to whom Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth of the choicest spoils. 







###### 5 



And those indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest's office have a commandment [^a]in the Law to collect [^b]a tenth from the people, that is, from their countrymen, although they [^c]are descended from Abraham. 







###### 6 



But the one whose genealogy is not traced from them collected [^d]a tenth from Abraham and [^e]blessed the one who had the promises. 







###### 7 



But without any dispute the lesser _person_ is blessed by the greater. 







###### 8 



In this case mortal men receive tithes, but in that case one _receives them_, of whom it is witnessed that he lives _on_. 







###### 9 



And, so to speak, through Abraham even Levi, who received tithes, has paid tithes, 







###### 10 



for he was still in the loins of his [^f]forefather when Melchizedek met him. 







###### 11 



So if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood (for on the basis of it the people received the Law), what further need _was there_ for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek, and not be designated according to the order of Aaron? 







###### 12 



For when the priesthood is changed, of necessity there takes place a change of law also. 







###### 13 



For the one about whom these things are said belongs to another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar. 







###### 14 



For it is evident that our Lord [^g]was descended from Judah, a tribe with reference to which Moses said nothing concerning priests. 







###### 15 



And this is clearer still, if another priest arises according to the likeness of Melchizedek, 







###### 16 



who has become _a priest_ not on the basis of a law of [^h]physical requirement, but according to the power of an indestructible life. 







###### 17 



For it is attested _of Him_, "You are a priest forever According to the order of Melchizedek." 







###### 18 



For, on the one hand, there is _the_ nullification of a former commandment because of its weakness and uselessness 







###### 19 



(for the Law made nothing perfect); on the other hand, _there is the_ introduction of a better hope, through which we come near to God. 







###### 20 



And to the extent that _it was_ not without an oath 







###### 21 



(for they indeed became priests without an oath, but He with an oath through the One who said to Him, "The Lord has sworn And will not change His mind, 'You are a priest forever'"); 







###### 22 



by the same extent Jesus also has become the [^i]guarantee of a better covenant. 







###### 23 



[^j]The _former_ priests, on the one hand, existed in greater numbers because they were prevented by death from continuing; 







###### 24 



[^k]Jesus, on the other hand, because He continues forever, holds His priesthood permanently. 







###### 25 



Therefore He is also able to save [^l]forever those who come to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them. 







###### 26 



For it was fitting for us to have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens; 







###### 27 



who has no daily need, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for His own sins and then for the _sins_ of the people, because He did this once for all _time_ when He offered up Himself. 







###### 28 



For the Law appoints men as high priests who are weak, but the word of the oath, which came after the Law, _appoints_ a Son, who has been made perfect forever. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Hebrews 8

***








###### 1 



Now the main point in what has been said _is this_: we have such a high priest, who has taken His seat at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, 







###### 2 



a minister [^a]in the sanctuary and [^b]in the true [^c]tabernacle, which the Lord set up, not man. 







###### 3 



For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices; so it is necessary that this _high priest_ also have something to offer. 







###### 4 



Now if He were on earth, He would not be a priest at all, since there are [^d]those who offer the gifts according to the Law; 







###### 5 



who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, just as Moses [^e]was warned _by God_ when he was about to erect the [^f]tabernacle; for, "See," He says, "that you make all things by the pattern which was shown to you on the mountain." 







###### 6 



But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry, to the extent that He is also the mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted on better promises. ## A New Covenant 







###### 7 



For if that first _covenant_ had been free of fault, no [^g]circumstances would have been sought for a second. 







###### 8 



For in finding fault with [^h]the people, He says, "Behold, days are coming, says the Lord, [^i]When I will bring about a new covenant With the house of Israel and the house of Judah, 







###### 9 



Not like the covenant which I made with their fathers On the day I took them by the hand To bring them out of the land of Egypt; For they did not continue in My covenant, And I did not care about them, says the Lord. 







###### 10 



For this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel After those days, declares the Lord: [^j]I will put My laws into their minds, And write them on their hearts. And I will be their God, And they shall be My people. 







###### 11 



And they will not teach, each one his fellow citizen, And each one his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord,' For they will all know Me, From [^k]the least to the greatest of them. 







###### 12 



For I will be merciful toward their wrongdoings, And their sins I will no longer remember." 







###### 13 



[^l]When He said, "A new _covenant_," He has made the first obsolete. But whatever is becoming obsolete and growing old is [^m]about to disappear. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Hosea 10

***








###### 1 



Israel is a luxuriant vine; He produces fruit for himself. The more his fruit, The more altars he made; The [^a]richer his land, The better [^b]he made the memorial stones. 







###### 2 



Their heart is [^c]deceitful; Now they must suffer for their guilt. [^d]The LORD will break down their altars _And_ destroy their memorial stones. 







###### 3 



Certainly now they will say, "We have no king, For we do not revere the LORD. As for the king, what can he do for us?" 







###### 4 



They speak _mere_ words, [^e]With worthless oaths they make covenants; And judgment sprouts like poisonous weeds in the furrows of the field. 







###### 5 



The inhabitants of Samaria will fear For the [^f]calf of Beth-aven. Indeed, its people will mourn for it, And its idolatrous priests [^g]will cry out over it, Over its glory, since it has left it. 







###### 6 



The thing itself will be brought to Assyria As a gift of tribute to [^h]King Jareb; Ephraim will [^i]be seized with shame, And Israel will be ashamed of its own plan. 







###### 7 



Samaria will be destroyed _with_ her king, Like a twig on the surface of the water. 







###### 8 



Also the high places of Aven, the sin of Israel, will be destroyed; Thorns and thistles will grow on their altars; Then they will say to the mountains, "Cover us!" And to the hills, "Fall on us!" 







###### 9 



Since the days of Gibeah you have sinned, Israel; There they stand! Will the battle against the sons of injustice not overtake them in Gibeah? 







###### 10 



When it is My desire, I will [^j]discipline them; And the peoples will be gathered against them When they are bound for their double guilt. 







###### 11 



Ephraim is a trained heifer that loves to thresh, [^k]And I passed over her lovely neck; I will harness Ephraim, Judah will plow, Jacob will [^l]harrow for himself. 







###### 12 



Sow for yourselves, _with a view_ to righteousness; Harvest in accordance with [^m]kindness. Break up your uncultivated ground, For it is time to seek the LORD Until He comes and rains righteousness on you. 







###### 13 



You have plowed wickedness, you have harvested injustice, You have eaten the fruit of lies. Because you have trusted in your way, in your many warriors, 







###### 14 



An uproar will arise among your people, And all your fortresses will be destroyed, As Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel on the day of battle, _When_ mothers were [^n]slaughtered with _their_ children. 







###### 15 



So it will be done to you at Bethel because of your great wickedness. At dawn the king of Israel will be completely destroyed. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Hosea 11

***








###### 1 



When Israel _was_ a youth I loved him, And out of Egypt I called My son. 







###### 2 



The more [^a]they called them, The more they went away from [^b]them; They kept sacrificing to the Baals And burning incense to idols. 







###### 3 



Yet it is I who taught Ephraim to walk, [^c]I took them in My arms; But they did not know that I healed them. 







###### 4 



I pulled them along with cords of a man, with ropes of love, And I became to them as one who lifts the yoke from their jaws; And I bent down _and_ fed them. 







###### 5 



[^d]They will not return to the land of Egypt; But Assyria--he will be [^e]their king Because they refused to return _to Me_. 







###### 6 



And the sword will whirl against [^f]their cities, And will destroy [^g]their oracle priests And consume _them_, because of their counsels. 







###### 7 



So My people are determined to turn from Me. Though [^h]they call [^i]them to _the One_ on high, None at all exalts _Him_. 







###### 8 



How can I give you up, Ephraim? _How_ can I surrender you, Israel? How can I [^j]make you like Admah? _How_ can I treat you like Zeboiim? My heart is turned over within Me, [^k]All My compassions are kindled. 







###### 9 



I will not carry out My fierce anger; I will not destroy Ephraim again. For I am God and not a man, the Holy One in your midst, And I will not come in [^l]wrath. 







###### 10 



They will walk after the LORD, He will roar like a lion; Indeed He will roar, And _His_ sons will come trembling from the west. 







###### 11 



They will come trembling like birds from Egypt, And like doves from the land of Assyria; And I will settle them in their houses, declares the LORD. 







###### 12 



[^m]Ephraim surrounds Me with lies And the house of Israel with deceit; [^n]Judah is still unruly against God, Even against the Holy One who is faithful. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

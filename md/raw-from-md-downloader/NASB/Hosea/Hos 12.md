# Hosea 12

***








###### 1 



[^a]Ephraim feeds on wind, And pursues the east wind continually; He multiplies lies and violence. Moreover, [^b]he makes a covenant with Assyria, And oil is brought to Egypt. 







###### 2 



The LORD also has a case against Judah, And will punish Jacob according to his ways; He will repay him according to his deeds. 







###### 3 



In the womb he took his brother by the heel, And in his mature strength he contended with God. 







###### 4 



Yes, he wrestled with the angel and prevailed; He wept and implored His favor. He found Him at Bethel, And there He spoke with us, 







###### 5 



And the LORD, the God of armies, The LORD is His [^c]name. 







###### 6 



So as for you, return to your God, Maintain [^d]kindness and justice, And wait for your God continually. 







###### 7 



A [^e]merchant, in whose hands are fraudulent balances, Loves to exploit. 







###### 8 



And Ephraim said, "I have certainly become rich, I have found wealth for myself; In all my labors they will find in me No wrongdoing, which _would be_ sin." 







###### 9 



But I _have been_ the LORD your God since the land of Egypt; I will make you live in tents again, As in the days of the appointed festival. 







###### 10 



I have also spoken to the prophets, And I [^f]provided many visions, And through the prophets I spoke in parables. 







###### 11 



Is there injustice _in_ Gilead? Certainly they are worthless. In Gilgal they sacrifice bulls, Yes, their altars are like stone heaps Beside the furrows of a field. 







###### 12 



Now Jacob fled to the [^g]land of Aram, And Israel worked for a wife, And for a wife he kept _sheep_. 







###### 13 



But by a prophet the LORD brought Israel up from Egypt, And by a prophet he was protected. 







###### 14 



Ephraim has provoked _God_ to bitter anger; So his Lord will leave his guilt for bloodshed on him And bring his disgrace back to him. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

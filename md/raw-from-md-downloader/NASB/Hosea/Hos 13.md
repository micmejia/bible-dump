# Hosea 13

***








###### 1 



When Ephraim [^a]spoke, _there was_ trembling. He exalted himself in Israel, But through Baal he incurred guilt and died. 







###### 2 



And now they sin more and more, And make for themselves cast metal images, Idols [^b]skillfully made from their silver, All of them the work of craftsmen. They say of them, "Let the [^c]people who sacrifice kiss the calves!" 







###### 3 



Therefore they will be like the morning cloud And like dew which [^d]soon disappears, Like chaff which is blown away from the threshing floor, And like smoke from a chimney. 







###### 4 



Yet I _have been_ the LORD your God Since the land of Egypt; And you were not to know any god except Me, For there is no savior besides Me. 







###### 5 



I [^e]cared for you in the wilderness, In the land of drought. 







###### 6 



As _they had_ their pasture, they became satisfied, _And as_ they became satisfied, their heart became proud; Therefore they forgot Me. 







###### 7 



So I will be like a lion to them; Like a leopard I will [^f]lie in wait by the wayside. 







###### 8 



I will confront them like a bear deprived of her cubs, And I will tear open [^g]their chests; I will also devour them there like a lioness, _As_ a wild animal would tear them to pieces. 







###### 9 



[^h]It is to your own destruction, Israel, That _you are_ against Me, against your help. 







###### 10 



Where then is your king, That he might save you in all your cities; And your judges, to whom you said, "Give me a king and princes"? 







###### 11 



I gave you a king in My anger, And took him away in My wrath. 







###### 12 



The guilt of Ephraim is wrapped up; His sin is stored up. 







###### 13 



The pains of childbirth come on him; He is not a wise son, For [^i]it is not the time that he should delay at the opening of the womb. 







###### 14 



Shall I ransom them from the [^j]power of Sheol? Shall I redeem them from death? Death, where are your [^k]thorns? Sheol, where is your sting? Compassion will be hidden from My sight. 







###### 15 



Though he flourishes among the [^l]reeds, An east wind will come, The wind of the LORD coming up from the wilderness; And his fountain will become dry And his spring will dry up; It will plunder _his_ treasury of every precious article. 







###### 16 



[^m]Samaria will pay the penalty for her guilt, Because she has rebelled against her God. They will fall by the sword, Their children will be [^n]slaughtered, And their pregnant women will be ripped open. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Hosea 14

***








###### 1 



[^a]Return, Israel, to the LORD your God, For you have stumbled [^b]because of your wrongdoing. 







###### 2 



Take words with you and return to the LORD. Say to Him, "Take away all guilt And [^c]receive _us_ graciously, So that we may present [^d]the fruit of our lips. 







###### 3 



Assyria will not save us, We will not ride on horses; Nor will we say again, 'Our god' To the work of our hands; For in You the [^e]orphan finds mercy." 







###### 4 



I will heal their apostasy, I will love them freely, Because My anger has turned away from them. 







###### 5 



I will be like the dew to Israel; He will blossom like the lily, And he will [^f]take root like _the cedars of_ Lebanon. 







###### 6 



His shoots will [^g]sprout, His [^h]majesty will be like the olive tree, And his fragrance like _the cedars of_ Lebanon. 







###### 7 



Those who live in his shadow Will [^i]again raise grain, And they will blossom like the vine. His fame _will be_ like the wine of Lebanon. 







###### 8 



Ephraim, what more have I to do with idols? It is I who answer and look after [^j]you. I am like a luxuriant juniper; From Me [^k]comes your fruit. 







###### 9 



Whoever is wise, let him understand these things; _Whoever_ is discerning, let him know them. For the ways of the LORD are right, And the righteous will walk in them, But wrongdoers will stumble in them. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

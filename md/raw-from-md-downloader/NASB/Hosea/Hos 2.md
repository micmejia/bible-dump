# Hosea 2

***








###### 1 



[^a]Say to your brothers, "[^b]Ammi," and to your sisters, "[^c]Ruhamah." 







###### 2 



"Dispute with your mother, dispute, Because she is not my wife, and I am not her husband; But she must remove her infidelity from her face And her adultery from between her breasts, 







###### 3 



Otherwise, I will strip her naked And expose her as on the day she was born. I will also make her like a wilderness, Make her like desert land, And put her to death with thirst. 







###### 4 



Also, I will take no pity on her children, Because they are children of infidelity. 







###### 5 



For their mother has committed prostitution; She who conceived them has acted shamefully. For she said, 'I will go after my lovers, Who give _me_ my bread and my water, My wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.' 







###### 6 



Therefore, behold, I will obstruct [^d]her way with thorns, And I will build [^e]a stone wall against her so that she cannot find her paths. 







###### 7 



And she will pursue her lovers, but she will not reach them; And she will seek them, but will not find _them_. Then she will say, 'I will go back to my first husband, Because it was better for me then than now!' 







###### 8 



"Yet she does not know that it was I myself who gave her the grain, the new wine, and the oil, And lavished on her silver and gold, _Which_ they [^f]used for Baal. 







###### 9 



Therefore, I will [^g]take back My grain at [^h]harvest time And My new wine in its season. I will also take away My wool and My flax _That I gave_ to cover her nakedness. 







###### 10 



So now I will uncover her [^i]lewdness Before the eyes of her lovers, And no one will rescue her from My hand. 







###### 11 



I will also put an end to all her joy, Her feasts, her new moons, her Sabbaths, And all her festivals. 







###### 12 



And I will destroy her vines and fig trees, Of which she said, 'They are my wages for prostitution Which my lovers have given me.' And I will turn them into a forest, And the animals of the field will devour them. 







###### 13 



I will punish her for the days of the Baals When she used to [^j]offer sacrifices to them And adorn herself with her nose ring and jewelry, And follow her lovers, so that she forgot Me," declares the LORD. ## Restoration of Israel 







###### 14 



"Therefore, behold, I am going to persuade her, Bring her _into_ the wilderness, And speak [^k]kindly to her. 







###### 15 



Then I will give her her vineyards from there, And the [^l]Valley of Achor as a door of hope. And she will [^m]respond there as in the days of her youth, As in the day when she went up from the land of Egypt. 







###### 16 



And it will come about on that day," declares the LORD, "That you will call Me [^n]my husband And no longer call Me my [^o]Baal. 







###### 17 



For I will remove the names of the Baals from her mouth, So that they will no longer be [^p]mentioned by their names. 







###### 18 



On that day I will also make a covenant for them With the animals of the field, The birds of the sky, And the crawling things of the ground. And I will [^q]eliminate the bow, the sword, and war from the land, And will let them lie down in safety. 







###### 19 



I will betroth you to Me forever; Yes, I will betroth you to Me in righteousness and in justice, In favor and in compassion, 







###### 20 



And I will betroth you to Me in faithfulness. Then you will know the LORD. 







###### 21 



"And it will come about on that day that I will respond," declares the LORD. "I will respond to the heavens, and they will respond to the earth, 







###### 22 



And the earth will respond to the grain, to the new wine, and to the oil, And they will respond to [^r]Jezreel. 







###### 23 



I will sow her for Myself in the land. I will also have compassion on [^s]her who had not obtained compassion, And I will say to [^t]those who were not My people, 'You are My people!' And [^u]they will say, '_You are_ my God!'" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

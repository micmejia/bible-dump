# Hosea 3

***








###### 1 



Then the LORD said to me, "Go again, love [^a]a woman _who_ is loved by _her_ [^b]husband, yet is committing adultery, as the LORD loves the sons of Israel, though they turn to other gods and love [^c]raisin cakes." 







###### 2 



So I purchased her for myself for fifteen _shekels_ of silver, and a [^d]homer and a [^e]lethech of barley. 







###### 3 



Then I said to her, "You shall live with me for many days. You shall not play the prostitute, nor shall you have _another_ man; so I will also be toward you." 







###### 4 



For the sons of Israel will live for many days without a king or leader, without sacrifice or memorial stone, and without ephod or [^f]household idols. 







###### 5 



Afterward the sons of Israel will return and seek the LORD their God and David their king; and they will come trembling to the LORD and to His goodness in the last days. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Hosea 5

***








###### 1 



Hear this, you priests! Pay attention, house of Israel! Listen, _you of_ the house of the king! For the judgment _applies_ to you, Because you have been a trap at Mizpah, And a net spread out on Tabor. 







###### 2 



And the rebels have gone deep in [^a]depravity, But I will discipline all of them. 







###### 3 



I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hidden from Me; Because now, Ephraim, you have been unfaithful, Israel has defiled itself. 







###### 4 



Their deeds will not allow them To return to their God. For a spirit of [^b]infidelity is within them, And they do not know the LORD. 







###### 5 



Moreover, the pride of Israel testifies against him, And Israel and Ephraim stumble in their wrongdoing; Judah also has stumbled with them. 







###### 6 



They will go with their flocks and herds To seek the LORD, but they will not find _Him_; He has withdrawn from them. 







###### 7 



They have dealt treacherously with the LORD, For they have given birth to [^c]illegitimate children. Now the new moon will devour them with their [^d]land. 







###### 8 



Blow the horn in Gibeah, _And_ the trumpet in Ramah. Sound an alarm at Beth-aven: "Behind you, Benjamin!" 







###### 9 



Ephraim will become a desolation in the day of rebuke; Among the tribes of Israel I make known what is trustworthy. 







###### 10 



The leaders of Judah have become like those who displace a boundary marker; On them I will pour out My anger like water. 







###### 11 



Ephraim is oppressed, broken _by_ judgment, Because he was determined to follow [^e]_man's_ command. 







###### 12 



Therefore I am like a moth to Ephraim, And like rottenness to the house of Judah. 







###### 13 



When Ephraim saw his sickness, And Judah his [^f]sore, Ephraim then went to Assyria And sent _word_ to [^g]King Jareb. But he is unable to heal you, Or to cure you of your [^h]sore. 







###### 14 



For I _will be_ like a lion to Ephraim And like a young lion to the house of Judah. I, _yes_ I, will tear to pieces and go away, I will carry away, and there will be no one to rescue. 







###### 15 



I will go away _and_ return to My place Until they [^i]acknowledge their guilt and seek My face; In their distress they will search for Me. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

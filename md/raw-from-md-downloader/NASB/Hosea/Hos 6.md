# Hosea 6

***








###### 1 



"Come, let's return to the LORD. For He has torn _us_, but He will heal us; He has [^a]wounded _us_, but He will bandage us. 







###### 2 



He will revive us after two days; He will raise us up on the third day, That we may live before Him. 







###### 3 



So let's learn, let's press on to know the LORD. His appearance is as sure as the dawn; And He will come to us like the rain, As the spring rain waters the earth." 







###### 4 



What shall I do with you, Ephraim? What shall I do with you, Judah? For your loyalty is like a morning cloud, And like the dew which goes away early. 







###### 5 



Therefore I have cut _them_ in pieces by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of My mouth; And the judgments on you are _like_ the light _that_ [^b]shines. 







###### 6 



For I [^c]desire loyalty rather than sacrifice, And the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings. 







###### 7 



But like [^d]Adam they have violated the covenant; There they have dealt treacherously with Me. 







###### 8 



Gilead is a city of wrongdoers, Tracked with bloody _footprints_. 







###### 9 



And as a band of robbers lie in wait for a person, _So_ a band of priests murder on the way to Shechem; Certainly they have committed an act of infamy. 







###### 10 



In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing; Ephraim's infidelity is there, Israel has defiled itself. 







###### 11 



Also, Judah, there is a harvest appointed for you, When I restore the fortunes of My people. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

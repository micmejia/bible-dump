# Hosea 7

***








###### 1 



When I would heal Israel, The wrongdoing of Ephraim is uncovered, And the evil deeds of Samaria, For they practice deception; The thief enters, A band of robbers attack outside, 







###### 2 



And they do not [^a]consider in their hearts That I remember all their wickedness. Now their deeds surround them; They are before My face. 







###### 3 



With their wickedness they make the king happy, And the officials with their lies. 







###### 4 



They are all adulterers, Like an oven heated by the baker, Who stops [^b]stoking _the fire_ From _the time_ the dough is kneaded until it is leavened. 







###### 5 



On the [^c]day of our king, the officials became sick with the heat of wine; He stretched out his hand with [^d]scoffers, 







###### 6 



For their hearts are like an oven _As_ they approach their [^e]plotting; Their [^f]anger [^g]smolders all night, In the morning it burns like flaming fire. 







###### 7 



All of them are hot like an oven, And they consume their rulers; All their kings have fallen. None of them calls on Me. 







###### 8 



Ephraim is himself thrown about with the [^h]nations; Ephraim has become a round loaf not turned over. 







###### 9 



Strangers devour his strength, Yet he does not know _it_; Gray hairs also are sprinkled on him, Yet he does not know _it_. 







###### 10 



Though the pride of Israel testifies against him, Yet they have not returned to the LORD their God, Nor have they sought Him, despite all this. 







###### 11 



So Ephraim has become like a gullible dove, without [^i]sense; They call to Egypt, they go to Assyria. 







###### 12 



When they go, I will spread My net over them; I will bring them down like the birds of the sky. I will discipline them in accordance with the [^j]proclamation to their assembly. 







###### 13 



Woe to them, for they have strayed from Me! Destruction is theirs, for they have rebelled against Me! I would redeem them, but they have spoken lies against Me. 







###### 14 



And they do not cry to Me from their heart When they wail on their beds; For the sake of grain and new wine they [^k]assemble themselves, They turn against Me. 







###### 15 



Although I trained _and_ strengthened their arms, Yet they devise evil against Me. 







###### 16 



They turn, _but_ not [^l]upward, They are like a loose bow; Their officials will fall by the sword Because of the [^m]insolence of their tongue. This _will be_ their derision in the land of Egypt. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

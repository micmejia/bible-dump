# Hosea 8

***








###### 1 



_Put_ the trumpet to your [^a]lips! Like an eagle _the enemy comes_ against the house of the LORD, Because they have violated My covenant And rebelled against My Law. 







###### 2 



They cry out to Me, "My God, we of Israel know You!" 







###### 3 



Israel has rejected the good; The enemy will pursue him. 







###### 4 



They have set up kings, but not by Me; They have appointed officials, but I did not know _it_. With their silver and gold they have made idols for themselves, So that [^b]they will be eliminated. 







###### 5 



[^c]He has rejected your calf, Samaria, _saying_, "My anger burns against them!" How long will they be incapable of innocence? 







###### 6 



For from Israel _comes_ even this! A craftsman made it, so it is not God; Assuredly, the calf of Samaria will be broken to [^d]pieces. 







###### 7 



For they sow wind And they harvest a storm. The standing grain has no [^e]kernels; It yields no [^f]grain. If it were to yield, strangers would swallow it. 







###### 8 



Israel has been swallowed up; They are now among the nations Like a vessel in which no one delights. 







###### 9 



For they have gone up to Assyria, _Like_ a wild donkey all alone; Ephraim has paid fees for [^g]lovers. 







###### 10 



Even though they [^h]pay _for allies_ among the nations, I will gather them up now; And they will begin to diminish Because of the burden of the king of officials. 







###### 11 



Since Ephraim has multiplied altars for sin, They have become altars of sinning for him. 







###### 12 



Though I wrote for him ten thousand _precepts_ of My Law, They are regarded as a strange thing. 







###### 13 



As for My sacrificial gifts, They sacrifice the flesh and eat _it_, _But_ the LORD has taken no delight in them. Now He will remember their guilt, And punish _them_ for their sins; They will return to Egypt. 







###### 14 



For Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces; And Judah has multiplied fortified cities, But I will send a fire on its cities, and it will consume its palatial buildings. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

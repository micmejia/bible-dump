# Hosea 9

***








###### 1 



Do not rejoice, Israel, [^a]with jubilation like the [^b]nations! For you have been unfaithful, [^c]abandoning your God. You have loved the earnings _of unfaithfulness_ on [^d]every threshing floor. 







###### 2 



Threshing floor and wine press will not feed them, And the new wine will fail [^e]them. 







###### 3 



They will not remain in the LORD's land, But Ephraim will return to Egypt, And in Assyria they will eat unclean _food_. 







###### 4 



They will not pour out drink offerings of wine to the LORD, Nor will [^f]their sacrifices please Him. _Their bread will be_ to them like [^g]mourners' bread; All who eat it will be defiled, Because their bread will be for [^h]themselves _alone_; It will not enter the house of the LORD. 







###### 5 



What will you do on the day of the appointed festival And on the day of the feast of the LORD? 







###### 6 



For behold, they will be gone because of destruction; Egypt will gather them together, Memphis will bury them. Weeds will take possession of their treasures of silver; Thorns _will be_ in their tents. 







###### 7 



The days of punishment have come, The days of retribution have come; [^i]Let Israel know _this_! The prophet is a fool, The [^j]inspired person is insane, Because of the grossness of your wrongdoing, And _because your_ [^k]hostility is _so_ great. 







###### 8 



Ephraim _was_ a watchman with my God, a prophet; _Yet_ the snare of a bird catcher is in all his ways, _And_ there is _only_ [^l]hostility in the house of his God. 







###### 9 



They are deeply depraved As in the days of Gibeah; He will remember their guilt, He will punish their sins. 







###### 10 



I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your forefathers as the earliest fruit on the fig tree in its first _season_. _But_ they came to Baal-peor and devoted themselves to [^m]shame, And they became as detestable as that which they loved. 







###### 11 



As for Ephraim, their glory will fly away like a bird-- No birth, no pregnancy, and no conception! 







###### 12 



Though they bring up their children, Yet I will bereave them of their children [^n]until not a person is left. Yes, woe to them indeed when I depart from them! 







###### 13 



Ephraim, as I have seen, Is planted in a pasture like Tyre; But Ephraim is going to bring out his children for slaughter. 







###### 14 



Give to them, LORD--what will You give? Give them a miscarrying womb and dried-up breasts. 







###### 15 



All their evil is at Gilgal; Indeed, I came to hate them there! Because of the wickedness of their deeds I will drive them out of My house! I will no longer love them; All their leaders are rebels. 







###### 16 



Ephraim is stricken, their root is dried up, They will produce no fruit. Even though they give birth to children, I will put to death the precious ones of their womb. 







###### 17 



My God will reject them Because they have not listened to Him; And they will be wanderers among the nations. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Isaiah 1

***








###### 1 



The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz concerning Judah and Jerusalem, which he saw during the [^a]reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, _and_ Hezekiah, kings of Judah. 







###### 2 



Listen, heavens, and hear, earth; For the LORD has spoken: "Sons I have raised and brought up, But they have revolted against Me. 







###### 3 



An ox knows its owner, And a donkey its master's manger, _But_ Israel does not know, My people do not understand." 







###### 4 



Oh, sinful nation, People weighed down with guilt, [^b]Offspring of evildoers, Sons who act corruptly! They have abandoned the LORD, They have despised the Holy One of Israel, They have turned away [^c]from Him. 







###### 5 



Where will you be stricken again, _As_ you continue in _your_ rebellion? The entire head is sick And the entire heart is faint. 







###### 6 



From the sole of the foot even to the head There is nothing healthy in it, _Only_ bruises, slashes, and raw wounds; Not pressed out nor bandaged, Nor softened with oil. 







###### 7 



Your land is desolate, Your cities are burned with fire; _As for_ your fields, strangers are devouring them in front of you; It is desolation, as overthrown by strangers. 







###### 8 



The daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard, Like a watchman's hut in a cucumber field, like a city under watch. 







###### 9 



If the LORD of armies Had not left us a few survivors, We would be like Sodom, We would be like Gomorrah. ## God Has Had Enough 







###### 10 



Hear the word of the LORD, You rulers of Sodom; Listen to the instruction of our God, You people of Gomorrah! 







###### 11 



"What are your many sacrifices to Me?" Says the LORD. "I [^d]have had enough of burnt offerings of rams And the fat of fattened cattle; And I take no pleasure in the blood of bulls, lambs, or goats. 







###### 12 



When you come to appear before Me, Who requires [^e]of you this trampling of My courtyards? 







###### 13 



Do not go on bringing your worthless offerings, Incense is an abomination to Me. New moon and Sabbath, the proclamation of an assembly-- I cannot endure wrongdoing and the festive assembly. 







###### 14 



[^f]I hate your new moon _festivals_ and your appointed feasts, They have become a burden to Me; I am tired of bearing _them_. 







###### 15 



So when you spread out your hands _in prayer_, I will hide My eyes from you; Yes, even though you offer many prayers, I will not be listening. Your hands are [^g]covered with blood. 







###### 16 



"Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean; Remove the evil of your deeds from My sight. Stop doing evil, 







###### 17 



Learn to do good; Seek justice, Rebuke the oppressor, Obtain justice for the orphan, Plead for the widow's case. ## Invitation to Debate 







###### 18 



"Come now, and let us [^h]debate _your case_," Says the LORD, "Though your sins are as scarlet, They shall become as white as snow; Though they are red like crimson, They shall be like wool. 







###### 19 



If you are willing and obedient, You will eat the best of the land; 







###### 20 



But if you refuse and rebel, You will be devoured by the sword." For the mouth of the LORD has spoken. ## Zion Corrupted; Will Be Redeemed 







###### 21 



How the faithful city has become a prostitute, She _who_ was full of justice! Righteousness _once_ dwelt in her, But now murderers. 







###### 22 



Your silver has become [^i]waste matter, Your drink diluted with water. 







###### 23 



Your rulers are rebels And companions of thieves; Everyone loves a bribe And chases after gifts. They do not obtain justice for the [^j]orphan, Nor does the widow's case come before them. 







###### 24 



Therefore the Lord [^k]God of armies, The Mighty One of Israel, declares, "Ah, I will have satisfaction against My adversaries, And avenge Myself on My enemies. 







###### 25 



I will also turn My hand against you, And smelt away your impurities as with lye; And I will remove all your slag. 







###### 26 



Then I will restore your judges as at first, And your counselors as at the beginning; After that you will be called the city of righteousness, A faithful city." 







###### 27 



Zion will be redeemed with justice And her [^l]repentant ones with righteousness. 







###### 28 



But [^m]wrongdoers and sinners together will be broken, And those who abandon the LORD will come to an end. 







###### 29 



[^n]You certainly will be ashamed of the [^o]oaks which you have desired, And you will be embarrassed by the gardens which you have chosen. 







###### 30 



For you will be like an [^p]oak whose leaf withers away, Or like a garden that has no water. 







###### 31 



The strong man will become _like_ [^q]flax fiber, And his work a spark. So they shall both burn together And there will be no one to extinguish _them_. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Isaiah 13

***








###### 1 



The pronouncement concerning Babylon which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw: 







###### 2 



Lift up a flag on the [^a]bare hill, Raise your voice to them, Wave the hand that they may enter the doors of the nobles. 







###### 3 



I have commanded My consecrated ones, I have also called for My warriors Who boast in My eminence, To _execute_ My anger. 







###### 4 



A sound of a roar on the mountains, Like that of many people! A sound of an uproar of kingdoms, Of nations gathered together! The LORD of armies is mustering the army for battle. 







###### 5 



They are coming from a distant country, From the [^b]farthest horizons, The LORD and the weapons of His indignation, To destroy the whole land. ## Judgment on the Day of the LORD 







###### 6 



Wail, for the day of the LORD is near! It will come as destruction from [^c]the Almighty. 







###### 7 



Therefore all hands will fall limp, And every human heart will melt. 







###### 8 



They will be terrified, Pains and anguish will take hold of _them_; They will writhe like a woman in labor, They will look at one another in astonishment, Their faces aflame. 







###### 9 



Behold, the day of the LORD is coming, Cruel, with fury and burning anger, To make the land a desolation; And He will exterminate its sinners from it. 







###### 10 



For the stars of heaven and their constellations Will not flash their light; The sun will be dark when it rises And the moon will not shed its light. 







###### 11 



So I will punish the world for its evil And the wicked for their wrongdoing; I will also put an end to the audacity of the proud And humiliate the arrogance of the [^d]tyrants. 







###### 12 



I will make mortal man scarcer than pure gold And mankind than the gold of Ophir. 







###### 13 



Therefore I will make the heavens tremble, And the earth will be shaken from its place At the fury of the LORD of armies In the day of His burning anger. 







###### 14 



And it will be that, like a hunted gazelle, Or like sheep with no one to gather _them_, Each of them will turn to his own people, And each of them will flee to his own land. 







###### 15 



Anyone who is found will be thrust through, And anyone who is captured will fall by the sword. 







###### 16 



Their little ones also will be dashed to pieces Before their eyes; Their houses will be plundered And their wives raped. ## Babylon Will Fall to the Medes 







###### 17 



Behold, I am going to stir up the Medes against them, Who will not value silver or take pleasure in gold. 







###### 18 



And _their_ bows will [^e]mow down the young men, They will not even have compassion on the fruit of the womb, _Nor_ will their eye pity [^f]children. 







###### 19 



And Babylon, the beauty of kingdoms, the glory of the Chaldeans' pride, Will be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. 







###### 20 



It will never be inhabited or lived in from generation to generation; Nor will the Arab pitch _his_ tent there, Nor will shepherds allow _their flocks_ to lie down there. 







###### 21 



But desert creatures will lie down there, And their houses will be full of [^g]owls; Ostriches also will live there, and [^h]shaggy goats will frolic there. 







###### 22 



[^i]Hyenas will howl in their fortified towers And jackals in their luxurious palaces. Her _fateful_ time also [^j]will soon come, And her days will not be prolonged. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

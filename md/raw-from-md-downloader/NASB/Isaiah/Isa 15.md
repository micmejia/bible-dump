# Isaiah 15

***








###### 1 



The pronouncement concerning Moab: Certainly in a night Ar of Moab is devastated _and_ ruined; Certainly in a night Kir of Moab is devastated _and_ ruined. 







###### 2 



[^a]The people have gone up to the [^b]temple and _to_ Dibon, to the high places to weep. Moab wails over Nebo and Medeba; Everyone's head is bald _and_ every beard is cut off. 







###### 3 



In their streets they have put on sackcloth; On their housetops and in their public squares Everyone is wailing, [^c]overcome with weeping. 







###### 4 



Heshbon and Elealeh also cry out, Their voice is heard all the way to Jahaz; Therefore the [^d]armed men of Moab cry aloud; His soul trembles within him. 







###### 5 



My heart cries out for Moab; His fugitives are as far as Zoar _and_ Eglath-shelishiyah, For they go up the ascent of Luhith weeping; Indeed, on the road to Horonaim they raise a cry of distress over _their_ collapse. 







###### 6 



For the waters of Nimrim are [^e]desolate. Indeed, the grass is withered, the new growth has died, There is no greenery. 







###### 7 



Therefore the abundance _which_ they have acquired and stored up, They carry _it_ off over the brook of [^f]Arabim. 







###### 8 



For the cry of distress has gone around the territory of Moab, Its wailing _goes_ as far as Eglaim and its howling to Beer-elim. 







###### 9 



For the waters of Dimon are full of [^g]blood; I will certainly bring added _woes_ upon Dimon, A lion upon the fugitives of Moab and the remnant of the land. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

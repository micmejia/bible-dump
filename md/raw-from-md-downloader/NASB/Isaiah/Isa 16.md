# Isaiah 16

***








###### 1 



Send the _tribute_ lamb to the ruler of the land, From [^a]Sela by way of the wilderness to the mountain of the daughter of Zion. 







###### 2 



Then, like fluttering birds _or_ scattered nestlings, The daughters of Moab will be at the crossing places of the Arnon. 







###### 3 



"[^b]Give _us_ advice, make a decision; [^c]Cast your shadow like night [^d]at high noon; Hide the outcasts, do not betray the fugitive. 







###### 4 



Let the [^e]outcasts of Moab stay with you; Be a hiding place to them from the destroyer." For the oppressor has come to an end, destruction has ceased, Oppressors have been removed from the land. 







###### 5 



A throne will be established in faithfulness, And a judge will sit on it in trustworthiness in the tent of David; Moreover, he will seek justice, And be prompt in righteousness. 







###### 6 



We have heard of the pride of Moab, an excessive pride; _Even_ of his arrogance, pride, and fury; His idle boasts are [^f]false. 







###### 7 



Therefore Moab will wail; everyone of Moab will wail. You will moan for the raisin cakes of Kir-hareseth As those who are utterly stricken. 







###### 8 



For the fields of Heshbon have [^g]withered, the vines of Sibmah _as well_; The lords of the nations have trampled down its choice clusters Which reached as far as Jazer _and_ wandered to the deserts; Its [^h]tendrils spread themselves out _and_ passed over the sea. 







###### 9 



Therefore I will weep bitterly for Jazer, for the vine of Sibmah; I will drench you with my tears, Heshbon and Elealeh; For the shouting over your summer fruits and your harvest has fallen away. 







###### 10 



Gladness and joy are taken away from the fruitful field; In the vineyards also there will be no cries of joy or jubilant shouting, No treader treads out wine in the presses, _For_ I have made the shouting to cease. 







###### 11 



Therefore my [^i]inner being sounds like a harp for Moab. And my [^j]heart for Kir-hareseth. 







###### 12 



So it will come about when Moab presents himself, When he tires himself upon _his_ high place And comes to his sanctuary to pray, That he will not prevail. 







###### 13 



This is the word which the LORD spoke earlier concerning Moab. 







###### 14 



But now the LORD has spoken, saying, "Within three years, as [^k]a hired worker would count them, the glory of Moab will become contemptible along with all _his_ great population, and _his_ remnant will be very small _and_ [^l]impotent." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

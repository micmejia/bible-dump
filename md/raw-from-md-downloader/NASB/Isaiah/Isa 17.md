# Isaiah 17

***








###### 1 



The pronouncement concerning Damascus: "Behold, Damascus is about to be removed from being a city And will become a fallen ruin. 







###### 2 



The cities [^a]of Aroer are abandoned; They will be for herds [^b]to lie down in, And there will be no one to frighten _them_. 







###### 3 



The [^c]fortified city will disappear from Ephraim, And [^d]sovereignty from Damascus And the remnant of Aram; They will be like the glory of the sons of Israel," Declares the LORD of armies. 







###### 4 



Now on that day the glory of Jacob will [^e]fade, And the fatness of his flesh will become lean. 







###### 5 



It will be like the [^f]reaper gathering the standing grain, As his arm harvests the ears, Or it will be like one gleaning ears of grain In the Valley of Rephaim. 







###### 6 



Yet gleanings will be left in it like the [^g]shaking of an olive tree, Two _or_ three olives on the topmost branch, Four _or_ five on the branches of a fruitful tree, Declares the LORD, the God of Israel. 







###### 7 



On that day man will look to his Maker And his eyes will look to the Holy One of Israel. 







###### 8 



And he will not look to the altars, the work of his hands, Nor will he look to that which his fingers have made, Even the [^h]Asherim and incense altars. 







###### 9 



On that day [^i]their strong cities will be like [^j]abandoned places in the forest, Or like branches which they abandoned before the sons of Israel; And [^k]the land will be a desolation. 







###### 10 



For you have forgotten the God of your salvation And have not remembered the rock of your refuge. Therefore you plant delightful plants And set them with vine shoots of a strange _god_. 







###### 11 



On the day that you plant _it_ you carefully fence _it_ in, And in the morning you bring your seed to blossom; _But_ the harvest will flee On a day of illness and incurable pain. 







###### 12 



Oh, the uproar of many peoples Who roar like the roaring of the seas, And the rumbling of nations Who rush on like the rumbling of mighty waters! 







###### 13 



The nations rumble on like the rumbling of many waters, But He will rebuke them, and they will flee far away, And be chased like chaff on the mountains before the wind, Or like whirling dust before a gale. 







###### 14 



At evening time, behold, _there is_ terror! Before morning they are gone. This _will be_ the [^l]fate of those who plunder us And the lot of those who pillage us. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Isaiah 18

***








###### 1 



Woe, land of whirring wings Which lies beyond the rivers of [^a]Cush, 







###### 2 



Which sends messengers by the sea, Even in papyrus vessels on the surface of the waters. Go, swift messengers, to a nation [^b]tall and smooth, To a people feared [^c]far and wide, A powerful and oppressive nation Whose land the rivers divide. 







###### 3 



All you who inhabit the world, and live on earth, As soon as a flag is raised on the mountains, you will see _it_, And as soon as the trumpet is blown, you will hear _it_. 







###### 4 



For this is what the LORD has told me: "I will quietly look [^d]from My dwelling place Like dazzling heat in the [^e]sunshine, Like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest." 







###### 5 



For before the harvest, as soon as the bud [^f]blossoms And the flower becomes a ripening grape, He will cut off the shoots with pruning knives, And remove _and_ tear away the spreading branches. 







###### 6 



They will be left together for mountain birds of prey, And for the animals of the earth; And the birds of prey will spend the summer _feeding_ on them, And all the animals of the earth will spend harvest time on them. 







###### 7 



At that time a gift of tribute will be brought to the LORD of armies [^g]From a people [^h]tall and smooth, From a people feared [^i]far and wide, A powerful and oppressive nation, Whose land the rivers divide-- To the place of the name of the LORD of armies, _to_ Mount Zion. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

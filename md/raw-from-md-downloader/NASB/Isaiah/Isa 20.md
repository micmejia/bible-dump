# Isaiah 20

***








###### 1 



In the year that the [^a]commander came to Ashdod, when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him and he fought against Ashdod and captured it, 







###### 2 



at that time the LORD spoke through Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, "Go and loosen the sackcloth from your hips and take your sandals off your feet." And he did so, going naked and barefoot. 







###### 3 



Then the LORD said, "Even as My servant Isaiah has gone naked and barefoot for three years as a sign and symbol against Egypt and [^b]Cush, 







###### 4 



so the king of Assyria will lead away the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Cush, young and old, naked and barefoot with buttocks uncovered, to the [^c]shame of Egypt. 







###### 5 



Then they will be terrified and ashamed because of Cush their hope and Egypt their pride. 







###### 6

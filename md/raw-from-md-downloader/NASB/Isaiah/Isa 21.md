# Isaiah 21

***








###### 1 



The pronouncement concerning the [^a]wilderness of the sea: As windstorms in the [^b]Negev come in turns, It comes from the wilderness, from a terrifying land. 







###### 2 



A harsh vision has been shown to me; The treacherous one _still_ deals treacherously, and the destroyer _still_ destroys. Go up, Elam, lay siege, Media; I have put an end to all [^c]the groaning she has caused. 







###### 3 



For this reason my loins are full of anguish; Pains have seized me like the pains of a woman in labor. I am so bewildered I cannot hear, so terrified I cannot see. 







###### 4 



My [^d]mind reels, [^e]horror overwhelms me; The twilight I longed for has been turned into trembling for me. 







###### 5 



They set the table, they [^f]spread out the cloth, they eat, they drink; "Rise up, captains, oil the shields!" 







###### 6 



For this is what the Lord says to me: "Go, station the lookout, have him report what he sees. 







###### 7 



When he sees [^g]a column of chariots, horsemen in pairs, A train of donkeys, a train of camels, He is to pay close attention, very close attention." 







###### 8 



Then [^h]the lookout called, "Lord, I stand continually by day on the watchtower, And I am stationed every night at my guard post. 







###### 9 



Now behold, here comes a troop of riders, horsemen in pairs." And one said, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon; And all the images of her gods [^i]are shattered on the ground." 







###### 10 



My downtrodden _people_, and my [^j]afflicted of the threshing floor! What I have heard from the LORD of armies, The God of Israel, I make known to you. ## Pronouncements about Edom and Arabia 







###### 11 



The pronouncement concerning [^k]Edom: One keeps calling to me from Seir, "Watchman, [^l]how far gone is the night? Watchman, [^m]how far gone is the night?" 







###### 12 



The watchman says, "Morning comes but also night. If you would inquire, inquire; Come back again." 







###### 13 



The pronouncement about Arabia: In the thickets of Arabia you [^n]must spend the night, You caravans of Dedanites. 







###### 14 



Bring water [^o]for the thirsty, You inhabitants of the land of Tema; Meet the fugitive with bread. 







###### 15 



For they have fled from the swords, From the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, And from the press of battle. 







###### 16 



For this is what the Lord said to me: "In a year, as [^p]a hired worker would count it, all the splendor of Kedar will come to an end; 







###### 17 



and the remainder of the number of bowmen, the warriors of the sons of Kedar, will be few; for the LORD God of Israel has spoken." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

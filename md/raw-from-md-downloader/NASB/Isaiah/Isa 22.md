# Isaiah 22

***








###### 1 



The pronouncement concerning the valley of vision: What is the matter with you now, that you have all gone up to the housetops? 







###### 2 



You who were full of noise, You tumultuous town, you jubilant city; Your dead were not killed with the sword, Nor [^a]did they die in battle. 







###### 3 



All your rulers have fled together, _And_ have been captured [^b]without the bow; All of you who were found were taken captive together, [^c]Though they had fled far away. 







###### 4 



Therefore I say, "Look away from me, Let me weep bitterly, Do not [^d]try to comfort me concerning the destruction of the daughter of my people." 







###### 5 



For the Lord [^e]God of armies has a day of panic, subjugation, and confusion In the valley of vision, A breaking down of walls And a crying [^f]to the mountain. 







###### 6 



Elam picked up the quiver, With the chariots, [^g]infantry, _and_ horsemen; And Kir uncovered the shield. 







###### 7 



Then your choicest valleys were full of chariots, And the horsemen took positions at the gate. 







###### 8 



And He removed the [^h]defense of Judah. On that day you [^i]depended on the weapons of the house of the forest, 







###### 9 



And you saw that the breaches In the _wall_ of the city of David were many; And you collected the waters of the lower pool. 







###### 10 



Then you counted the houses of Jerusalem And tore down houses to fortify the wall. 







###### 11 



And you made a reservoir between the two walls For the waters of the old pool. But you did not [^j]depend on Him who made it, Nor did you [^k]take into consideration Him who planned it long ago. 







###### 12 



Therefore on that day the Lord [^l]God of armies called _you_ to weeping, to wailing, To shaving the head, and to wearing sackcloth. 







###### 13 



Instead, there is joy and jubilation, Killing of cattle and slaughtering of sheep, Eating of meat and drinking of wine: "Let's eat and drink, for tomorrow we may die." 







###### 14 



But the LORD of armies revealed Himself [^m]to me: "Certainly this wrongdoing will not be [^n]forgiven you Until you die," says the Lord [^o]God of armies. 







###### 15 



This is what the Lord [^p]God of armies says: "Come, go to this steward, To Shebna who is in charge of the _royal_ household, 







###### 16 



'What right do you have here, And whom do you have here, That you have cut out a tomb for yourself here, You who cut out a tomb on the height, You who carve a resting place for [^q]yourself in the rock? 







###### 17 



Behold, the LORD is about to hurl you violently, you strong man. And He is about to grasp you firmly 







###### 18 



_And_ wrap you up tightly like a ball, _To be_ _driven_ into a vast country; There you will die, And there your splendid chariots will be, You shame of your master's house!' 







###### 19 



I will depose you from your office, And [^r]I will pull you down from your position. 







###### 20 



Then it will come about on that day, That I will summon My servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, 







###### 21 



And I will clothe him with your tunic And tie your sash securely around him. I will hand your [^s]authority over to him, And he will become a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. 







###### 22 



Then I will put the key of the house of David on his shoulder; When he opens, no one will shut, When he shuts, no one will open. 







###### 23 



I will drive him _like_ a peg in a firm place, And he will become a throne of glory to his father's house. 







###### 24 



So they will hang on him all the glory of his father's house, the offspring and the [^t]descendants, all the least of vessels, from bowls to all the jars. 







###### 25 



On that day," declares the LORD of armies, "the peg driven into a firm place will give way; it will even break off and fall, and the load that is _hanging_ on it will be cut off, for the LORD has spoken." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

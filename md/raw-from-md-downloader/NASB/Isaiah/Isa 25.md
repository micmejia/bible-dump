# Isaiah 25

***








###### 1 



LORD, You are my God; I will exalt You, I will give thanks to Your name; For You have worked wonders, Plans _formed_ long ago, with perfect faithfulness. 







###### 2 



For You have turned a city into a heap, A fortified city into a ruin; A palace of strangers is no longer a city, It will never be rebuilt. 







###### 3 



Therefore a strong people will glorify You; Cities of ruthless nations will revere You. 







###### 4 



For You have been a stronghold for the helpless, A stronghold for the poor in his distress, A refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat; For the breath of the ruthless Is like a _rain_ storm _against_ a wall. 







###### 5 



Like heat in a dry land, You subdue the uproar of foreigners; _Like_ heat by the shadow of a cloud, the song of the ruthless is [^a]silenced. 







###### 6 



Now the LORD of armies will prepare a [^b]lavish banquet for all peoples on this mountain; A banquet of [^c]aged wine, [^d]choice pieces with marrow, _And_ [^e]refined, aged wine. 







###### 7 



And on this mountain He will destroy the [^f]covering which is over all peoples, The veil which is [^g]stretched over all nations. 







###### 8 



He will [^h]swallow up death for all time, And the Lord [^i]God will wipe tears away from all faces, And He will remove the disgrace of His people from all the earth; For the LORD has spoken. 







###### 9 



And it will be said on that day, "Behold, this is our God for whom we have waited [^j]that He might save us. This is the LORD for whom we have waited; Let's rejoice and be glad in His salvation." 







###### 10 



For the hand of the LORD will rest on this mountain, And Moab will be trampled down in his place As straw is trampled down in the water of a manure pile. 







###### 11 



And he will spread out his hands in the middle of it As a swimmer spreads out _his hands_ to swim, But _the Lord_ will lay low his pride together with the trickery of his hands. 







###### 12 



The unassailable fortifications of your walls He will bring down, Lay low, _and_ throw to the ground, to the dust. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Isaiah 26

***








###### 1 



On that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah: "We have a strong city; He sets up walls and ramparts for [^a]security. 







###### 2 



Open the gates, that the righteous nation may enter, The one that [^b]remains faithful. 







###### 3 



The steadfast of mind You will keep in perfect peace, Because he trusts in You. 







###### 4 



Trust in the LORD forever, For in [^c]God the LORD, _we have_ an everlasting Rock. 







###### 5 



For He has brought low those who dwell on high, the unassailable city; He lays it low, He lays it low to the ground, He casts it to the dust. 







###### 6 



The foot will trample it, The feet of the poor, the steps of the helpless." 







###### 7 



The way of the righteous is smooth; O Upright One, make the path of the righteous level. 







###### 8 



Indeed, _while following_ the way of Your judgments, LORD, We have waited for You eagerly; Your name, and remembering You, is the desire of _our_ souls. 







###### 9 



At night [^d]my soul longs for You, Indeed, [^e]my spirit within me seeks You diligently; For when the earth [^f]experiences Your judgments, The inhabitants of the world learn righteousness. 







###### 10 



_Though_ the wicked person is shown compassion, He does not learn righteousness; He deals unjustly in the land of uprightness, And does not perceive the majesty of the LORD. 







###### 11 



LORD, Your hand is lifted up, _yet_ they do not see it. [^g]They see _Your_ zeal for the people and are put to shame; Indeed, [^h]fire will devour Your enemies. 







###### 12 



LORD, You will establish peace for us, Since You have also performed for us all our works. 







###### 13 



LORD, our God, other masters besides You have ruled us; _But_ through You alone we [^i]confess Your name. 







###### 14 



The dead will not live, the [^j]departed spirits will not rise; Therefore You have punished and destroyed them, And You have eliminated all remembrance of them. 







###### 15 



You have increased the nation, LORD, You have increased the nation, You are glorified; You have extended all the borders of the land. 







###### 16 



LORD, they sought You in distress; They [^k]could only whisper a prayer, Your discipline was upon them. 







###### 17 



As the pregnant woman approaches _the time_ to give birth, She writhes _and_ cries out in her labor pains; This is how we were before You, LORD. 







###### 18 



We were pregnant, we writhed _in labor_, We gave birth, as it seems, _only_ to wind. We could not accomplish deliverance for the earth, Nor were inhabitants of the world [^l]born. 







###### 19 



Your dead will live; [^m]Their corpses will rise. You who lie in the dust, awake and shout for joy, For your dew _is as_ the dew of the [^n]dawn, And the earth will [^o]give birth to the [^p]departed spirits. 







###### 20 



Come, my people, enter your rooms And close your doors behind you; Hide for a little [^q]while Until indignation [^r]runs _its_ course. 







###### 21 



For behold, the LORD is about to come out from His place To punish the inhabitants of the earth for their wrongdoing; And the earth will reveal her bloodshed And will no longer cover her slain. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

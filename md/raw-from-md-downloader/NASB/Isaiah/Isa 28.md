# Isaiah 28

***








###### 1 



Woe to the proud crown of the habitually drunk of Ephraim, And to the fading flower of its glorious beauty, Which is at the head of the [^a]fertile valley Of those who are [^b]overcome with wine! 







###### 2 



Behold, the Lord has a strong and mighty _agent_; As a storm of hail, a tempest of destruction, Like a storm of mighty overflowing waters, He has thrown _it_ down to the earth with _His_ hand. 







###### 3 



The splendid crown of the habitually drunk of Ephraim is trampled underfoot. 







###### 4 



And the fading flower of its glorious beauty, Which is at the head of the [^c]fertile valley, Will be like the first-ripe fig prior to the summer, Which [^d]one sees, _And_ [^e]as soon as it is in his [^f]hand, He swallows it. 







###### 5 



On that day the LORD of armies will become a beautiful crown And a glorious wreath to the remnant of His people; 







###### 6 



A spirit of justice for him who sits in judgment, A strength to those who repel the [^g]onslaught at the gate. 







###### 7 



And these also reel with wine and stagger from intoxicating drink: The priest and the prophet reel with intoxicating drink, They are confused by wine, they stagger from intoxicating drink; They reel while [^h]having visions, They stagger _when rendering_ a verdict. 







###### 8 



For all the tables are full of filthy vomit, without a _single clean_ place. 







###### 9 



"To whom would He teach knowledge, And to whom would He interpret the message? Those _just_ weaned from milk? Those _just_ taken from the breast? 







###### 10 



For _He says_, '[^i]Order on order, order on order, Line on line, line on line, A little here, a little there.'" 







###### 11 



Indeed, He will speak to this people Through stammering lips and a foreign tongue, 







###### 12 



He who said to them, "This is the place of quiet, give rest to the weary," And, "This is the resting place," but they would not listen. 







###### 13 



So the word of the LORD to them will be, "[^j]Order on order, order on order, Line on line, line on line, A little here, a little there," That they may go and stumble backward, be broken, snared, and taken captive. ## Judah Is Warned 







###### 14 



Therefore, hear the word of the LORD, you scoffers, Who rule this people who are in Jerusalem, 







###### 15 



Because you have said, "We have made a covenant with death, And with [^k]Sheol we have made a [^l]pact. The [^m]gushing flood will not reach us when it passes by, Because we have made falsehood our refuge and we have concealed ourselves with deception." 







###### 16 



Therefore this is what the Lord [^n]God says: "Behold, I am laying a stone in Zion, a tested stone, A precious cornerstone _for_ the foundation, [^o]firmly placed. The one who believes _in it_ will not be [^p]disturbed. 







###### 17 



I will make justice the measuring line And righteousness the level; Then hail will sweep away the refuge of lies, And the waters will overflow the secret place. 







###### 18 



Your covenant with death will be [^q]canceled, And your pact with Sheol will not stand; When the [^r]gushing flood passes through, Then you will become its trampling _ground_. 







###### 19 



As often as it passes through, it will [^s]seize you; For morning after morning it will pass through, _anytime_ during the day or night, And it will be [^t]sheer terror to understand [^u]what it means." 







###### 20 



The bed is too short on which to stretch out, And the blanket is too [^v]small to wrap oneself in. 







###### 21 



For the LORD will rise up as _at_ Mount Perazim, He will be stirred up as in the Valley of Gibeon, To do His task, His [^w]unusual task, And to work His work, His [^x]extraordinary work. 







###### 22 



And now do not carry on as scoffers, Or your shackles will be made stronger; For I have heard from the Lord [^y]God of armies Of decisive destruction on all the earth. 







###### 23 



Listen and hear my voice, Pay attention and hear my words. 







###### 24 



Does the [^z]farmer plow [^aa]continually to plant seed? Does he _continually_ [^ab]turn and break up his ground? 







###### 25 



Does he not level its surface And sow dill and scatter cumin And [^ac]plant wheat in rows, Barley in its place and rye within its [^ad]area? 







###### 26 



For his God instructs and teaches him properly. 







###### 27 



For dill is not threshed with a threshing sledge, Nor is the cartwheel [^ae]driven over cumin; But dill is beaten out with a rod, and cumin with a club. 







###### 28 



_Grain for_ bread is crushed, Indeed, he does not continue to thresh it forever. Because the wheel of _his_ cart and his horses _eventually_ [^af]damage _it_, He does not thresh it _longer_. 







###### 29 



This also comes from the LORD of armies, _Who_ has made _His_ counsel wonderful and _His_ wisdom great. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

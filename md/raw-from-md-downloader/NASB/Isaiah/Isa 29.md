# Isaiah 29

***








###### 1 



Woe, [^a]Ariel, [^b]Ariel the city _where_ David _once_ camped! Add year to year, [^c]keep _your_ feasts on schedule. 







###### 2 



I will bring distress to Ariel, And she will be _a city of_ grieving and mourning; And she will be like an [^d]Ariel to me. 







###### 3 



I will camp against you [^e]encircling _you_, And I will set up siegeworks against you, And I will raise up battle towers against you. 







###### 4 



Then you will be brought low; From the earth you will speak, And from the dust _where_ you are prostrate Your words _will come_. Your voice will also be like that of a [^f]spirit from the ground, And your speech will whisper from the dust. 







###### 5 



But the multitude of your [^g]enemies will become like fine dust, And the multitude of the ruthless ones like the chaff which [^h]blows away; And it will happen instantly, suddenly. 







###### 6 



From the LORD of armies you will be punished with thunder and earthquake and loud noise, _With_ whirlwind and tempest and the flame of a consuming fire. 







###### 7 



And the multitude of all the nations who wage war against [^i]Ariel, Even all who wage war against her and her stronghold, and who distress her, Will be like a dream, a vision of the night. 







###### 8 



It will be as when a hungry person dreams-- And behold, he is eating; But when he awakens, his [^j]hunger is not satisfied, Or as when a thirsty person dreams-- And behold, he is drinking, But when he awakens, behold, he is faint And his [^k]thirst is not quenched. So will the multitude of all the nations be Who wage war against Mount Zion. 







###### 9 



Be delayed and horrified, Blind yourselves and be blind; They become drunk, but not with wine, They stagger, but not with intoxicating drink. 







###### 10 



For the LORD has poured over you a spirit of deep sleep, He has shut your eyes--the prophets; And He has covered your heads--the seers. 







###### 11 



The entire vision will be to you like the words of a sealed [^l]book, which, when they give it to the one who [^m]is literate, saying, "Please read this," he will say, "I cannot, because it is sealed." 







###### 12 



Then the [^n]book will be given to the one who [^o]is illiterate, saying, "Please read this." And he will say, "I [^p]cannot read." 







###### 13 



Then the Lord said, "Because this people approaches _Me_ with their [^q]words And honors Me with their lips, But their heart is far away from Me, And their [^r]reverence for Me [^s]consists of _the_ commandment of men that is taught; 







###### 14 



Therefore behold, I will once again deal marvelously with this people, wondrously marvelous; And the wisdom of their wise men will perish, And the understanding of their men who have understanding will be concealed." 







###### 15 



Woe to those who deeply hide their [^t]plans from the LORD, And whose deeds are _done_ in a dark place, And they say, "Who sees us?" or "Who knows us?" 







###### 16 



You turn _things_ around! Shall the potter be considered [^u]as equal with the clay, That what is made would say to its maker, "He did not make me"; Or what is formed say to him who formed it, "He has no understanding"? ## Blessing after Discipline 







###### 17 



Is it not yet just a little while [^v]Before Lebanon will be turned into a fertile field, And the fertile field will be considered as a forest? 







###### 18 



On that day those who are deaf will hear words of a book, And out of _their_ gloom and darkness the eyes of those who are blind will see. 







###### 19 



The afflicted also will increase their joy in the LORD, And the needy of mankind will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel. 







###### 20 



For the ruthless will come to an end and the scorner will be finished, Indeed all who [^w]are intent on doing evil will be eliminated, 







###### 21 



Who [^x]cause a person to be indicted by a word, And set a trap for the arbitrator at the gate, And [^y]defraud the one in the right with [^z]meaningless arguments. 







###### 22 



Therefore this is what the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, says concerning the house of Jacob: "Jacob will not be ashamed now, nor will his face turn pale now; 







###### 23 



But when [^aa]he sees his children, the work of My hands, in his midst, They will sanctify My name; Indeed, they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, And will stand in awe of the God of Israel. 







###### 24 



Those who err in [^ab]mind will know [^ac]the truth, And those who [^ad]criticize will [^ae]accept instruction. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

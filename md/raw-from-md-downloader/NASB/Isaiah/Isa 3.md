# Isaiah 3

***








###### 1 



For behold, the Lord [^a]God of armies is going to remove from Jerusalem and Judah _Both_ supply and support, the entire supply of bread And the entire supply of water; 







###### 2 



The mighty man and the warrior, The judge and the prophet, The diviner and the elder, 







###### 3 



The captain of fifty and the esteemed _person_, The counselor and the expert artisan, And the skillful enchanter. 







###### 4 



And I will make _mere_ boys their leaders, And [^b]mischievous _children_ will rule over them, 







###### 5 



And the people will be oppressed, Each one by another, and each one by his neighbor; The youth will assault the elder, And the contemptible _person will assault_ the one honored. 







###### 6 



When a man lays hold of his brother in his father's house, _saying_, "You have a cloak, you shall be our ruler! And these ruins will be under your [^c]authority," 







###### 7 



He will [^d]protest on that day, saying, "I will not be _your_ [^e]healer, For in my house there is neither bread nor cloak; You should not appoint me ruler of the people." 







###### 8 



For Jerusalem has stumbled and Judah has fallen, Because their [^f]speech and their actions are against the LORD, To rebel against [^g]His glorious presence. 







###### 9 



[^h]The expression of their faces testifies against them, And they [^i]display their sin like Sodom; They do not _even_ conceal _it_. Woe to [^j]them! For they have done evil to themselves. 







###### 10 



Say to the righteous that _it will go_ well _for them_, For they will eat the fruit of their actions. 







###### 11 



Woe to the wicked! _It will go_ badly _for him_, For [^k]what he deserves will be done to him. 







###### 12 



My people! Their oppressors treat them violently, And women rule over them. My people! Those who guide you lead _you_ astray And confuse the direction of your paths. ## God Will Judge 







###### 13 



The LORD arises to contend, And stands to judge the people. 







###### 14 



The LORD enters into judgment with the elders and leaders of His people, "It is you who have [^l]devoured the vineyard; The goods stolen from the poor are in your houses. 







###### 15 



What do you mean by crushing My people And [^m]oppressing the face of the poor?" Declares the Lord [^n]God of armies. ## Judah's Women Denounced 







###### 16 



Moreover, the LORD said, "Because the daughters of Zion are haughty And walk with [^o]heads held high and seductive eyes, And go along with mincing steps And jingle the anklets on their feet, 







###### 17 



The Lord will afflict the scalp of the daughters of Zion with scabs, And the LORD will make their foreheads bare." 







###### 18 



On that day the Lord will take away the beauty of _their_ anklets, headbands, crescent ornaments, 







###### 19 



dangling earrings, bracelets, veils, 







###### 20 



headdresses, ankle chains, sashes, perfume boxes, amulets, 







###### 21 



[^p]finger rings, nose rings, 







###### 22 



festive robes, outer garments, shawls, purses, 







###### 23 



papyrus garments, undergarments, headbands, and veils. 







###### 24 



Now it will come about that instead of balsam oil there will be a stench; Instead of a belt, a rope; Instead of well-set hair, a plucked-out scalp; Instead of fine clothes, a robe of sackcloth; _And_ branding instead of beauty. 







###### 25 



Your men will fall by the sword And your [^q]mighty ones in battle. 







###### 26 



And her [^r]gates will lament and mourn, And she will sit deserted on the ground. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Isaiah 30

***








###### 1 



"Woe to the rebellious children," declares the LORD, "Who execute a plan, but not Mine, And [^a]make an alliance, but not of My Spirit, In order to add sin to sin; 







###### 2 



Who proceed down to Egypt Without consulting [^b]Me, To take refuge in the safety of Pharaoh, And to seek shelter in the shadow of Egypt! 







###### 3 



Therefore the safety of Pharaoh will be your shame, And the shelter in the shadow of Egypt, your humiliation. 







###### 4 



For their officials are at Zoan And their ambassadors arrive at Hanes. 







###### 5 



Everyone will be ashamed because of a people who do not benefit them, _Who are_ not a help or benefit, but _a source of_ shame and also disgrace." 







###### 6 



The pronouncement concerning the animals of the Negev: Through a land of distress and anguish, From [^c]where _come_ lioness and lion, viper and flying serpent, They carry their riches on the [^d]backs of young donkeys, And their treasures on camels' humps, To a people who will not benefit _them_; 







###### 7 



Even Egypt, whose help is vain and empty. Therefore, I have called [^e]her "[^f]Rahab who has been exterminated." 







###### 8 



Now go, write it on a tablet in their presence And inscribe it on a scroll, That it may [^g]serve in the time to come [^h]As a witness forever. 







###### 9 



For this is a rebellious people, false sons, Sons who [^i]refuse to listen To the [^j]instruction of the LORD; 







###### 10 



Who say to the seers, "You must not see _visions_"; And to the prophets, "You must not prophesy the truth to us. Speak to us [^k]pleasant words, Prophesy illusions. 







###### 11 



Get out of the way, turn aside from the path, Stop _speaking_ before us _about_ the Holy One of Israel!" 







###### 12 



Therefore this is what the Holy One of Israel says: "Since you have rejected this word And have put your trust in oppression and crookedness, and have relied on them, 







###### 13 



Therefore this wrongdoing will be to you Like a breach about to fall, A bulge in a high wall, Whose collapse comes suddenly in an instant, 







###### 14 



Whose collapse is like the smashing of a potter's jar, [^l]So ruthlessly shattered That a shard will not be found among its pieces To [^m]take fire from a hearth Or to scoop water from a cistern." 







###### 15 



For this is what the Lord [^n]God, the Holy One of Israel, has said: "In [^o]repentance and rest you will be saved, In quietness and trust is your strength." But you were not willing, 







###### 16 



And you said, "No, for we will flee on horses!" Therefore you shall flee! "And we will ride on swift _horses_!" Therefore those who pursue you shall be swift. 







###### 17 



One thousand _will flee_ at the threat of one _man_; You will flee at the threat of five, Until you are left like a signal post on a mountain top, And like a flag on a hill. ## God Is Gracious and Just 







###### 18 



Therefore the LORD [^p]longs to be gracious to you, And therefore He [^q]waits on high to have compassion on you. For the LORD is a God of justice; How blessed are all those who [^r]long for Him. 







###### 19 



[^s]For, you people in Zion, inhabitant in Jerusalem, you will weep no longer. He will certainly be gracious to you at the sound of your cry; when He hears it, He will answer you. 







###### 20 



Although the Lord has given you bread of deprivation and water of oppression, _He_, your Teacher, will no longer hide Himself, but your eyes will see your Teacher. 







###### 21 



Your ears will hear a word behind you, saying, "This is the way, walk in it," whenever you turn to the right or to the left. 







###### 22 



And you will desecrate your carved images plated with silver, and your cast metal images plated with gold. You will scatter them as a filthy thing, _and_ say to [^t]them, "Be gone!" 







###### 23 



Then He will give _you_ rain for your seed which you will sow in the ground, and bread _from_ the yield of the ground, and it will be [^u]rich and [^v]plentiful; on that day your livestock will graze in a wide pasture. 







###### 24 



Also the oxen and the donkeys that work the ground will eat [^w]seasoned feed, which [^x]has been winnowed with shovel and pitchfork. 







###### 25 



And on every lofty mountain and every high hill there will be [^y]streams running with water on the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall. 







###### 26 



And the light of the full moon will be like the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be seven times _brighter_, like the light of seven days, on the day the LORD binds up the fracture of His people and heals the wound [^z]He has inflicted. 







###### 27 



Behold, the name of the LORD comes from a [^aa]remote place; His anger is burning and [^ab]dense with [^ac]smoke; His lips are filled with indignation, And His tongue is like a consuming fire; 







###### 28 



His breath is like an overflowing river, Which reaches to the neck, To shake the nations back and forth in a [^ad]sieve, And to _put_ in the jaws of the peoples the bridle which leads astray. 







###### 29 



You will have [^ae]songs as in the night when you keep the festival, And gladness of heart as when one marches to _the sound of_ the flute, To go to the mountain of the LORD, to the Rock of Israel. 







###### 30 



And the LORD will cause [^af]His voice of authority to be heard, And the [^ag]descending of His arm to be seen in fierce anger, And _in_ the flame of a consuming fire In cloudburst, downpour, and hailstones. 







###### 31 



For at the voice of the LORD Assyria will be terrified, _When_ He strikes with the rod. 







###### 32 



And every [^ah]blow of the [^ai]rod of punishment, Which the LORD will lay on him, Will be with _the music of_ tambourines and lyres; And in battles, brandishing weapons, He will fight them. 







###### 33 



For [^aj]Topheth has long been ready, Indeed, it has been prepared for the king. He has made it deep and large, [^ak]A pyre of fire with plenty of wood; The breath of the LORD, like a torrent of brimstone, sets it afire. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

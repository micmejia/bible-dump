# Isaiah 32

***








###### 1 



Behold, a king will reign righteously, And officials will rule justly. 







###### 2 



Each will be like a refuge from the wind And a shelter from the storm, Like [^a]streams of water in a dry country, Like the shade of a [^b]huge rock in an exhausted land. 







###### 3 



Then the eyes of those who see will not be [^c]blinded, And the ears of those who hear will listen. 







###### 4 



The [^d]mind of the rash will discern the [^e]truth, And the tongue of the stammerers will hurry to speak clearly. 







###### 5 



No longer will the fool be called noble, Or the rogue be spoken of _as_ generous. 







###### 6 



For a fool speaks nonsense, And his heart [^f]inclines toward wickedness: To practice ungodliness and to speak error against the LORD, To [^g]keep the hungry person unsatisfied And [^h]to withhold drink from the thirsty. 







###### 7 



As for a rogue, his weapons are evil; He devises wicked schemes To destroy _the_ poor with [^i]slander, Even though _the_ needy one speaks [^j]what is right. 







###### 8 



But the noble person devises noble plans; And by noble plans he stands. 







###### 9 



Rise up, you women who are at ease, _And_ hear my voice; Listen to my word, You complacent daughters. 







###### 10 



Within a year and _a few_ days You will be troubled, you complacent _daughters_; For the vintage is ended, _And_ the _fruit_ gathering will not come. 







###### 11 



Tremble, you _women_ who are at ease; Be troubled, you complacent _daughters_; Strip, undress, and put _sackcloth_ on _your_ waist, 







###### 12 



Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine, 







###### 13 



For the land of my people _in which_ thorns _and_ briars will come up; Indeed, for all the joyful houses _and for_ the jubilant city. 







###### 14 



For the palace has been neglected, the [^k]populated city abandoned. [^l]Hill and watch-tower have become caves forever, A delight for wild donkeys, a pasture for flocks, 







###### 15 



Until the Spirit is poured out upon us from on high, And the wilderness becomes a fertile field, And the fertile field is considered as a forest. 







###### 16 



Then justice will dwell in the wilderness, And righteousness will remain in the fertile field. 







###### 17 



And the work of righteousness will be peace, And the service of righteousness, quietness and [^m]confidence forever. 







###### 18 



Then my people will live in a peaceful settlement, In secure dwellings, and in undisturbed resting places; 







###### 19 



And it will hail when the forest comes down, And the city will be utterly laid low. 







###### 20 



How blessed will you be, you who sow beside all waters, Who [^n]let the ox and the donkey out freely. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

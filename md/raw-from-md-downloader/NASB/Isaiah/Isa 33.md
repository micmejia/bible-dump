# Isaiah 33

***








###### 1 



Woe to you, destroyer, While you were not destroyed; And he who is treacherous, while _others_ did not deal treacherously with him. As soon as you finish destroying, you will be destroyed; As soon as you cease to deal treacherously, _others_ will deal treacherously with you. 







###### 2 



LORD, be gracious to us; we have waited for You. Be [^a]their [^b]strength every morning, Our salvation also in the time of distress. 







###### 3 



At the sound of a roar, peoples flee; At the lifting up of Yourself, nations disperse. 







###### 4 



Your plunder is gathered _as_ the caterpillar gathers; Like an infestation of locusts, people storm it. 







###### 5 



The LORD is exalted, for He dwells on high; He has filled Zion with justice and righteousness. 







###### 6 



And He will be the [^c]stability of your times, A wealth of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge; The fear of the LORD is his treasure. 







###### 7 



Behold, their brave men cry out [^d]in the streets, The [^e]ambassadors of peace weep bitterly. 







###### 8 



The highways are desolate, [^f]the traveler has ceased, He has broken the covenant, he has despised the cities, He has no regard for mankind. 







###### 9 



The land mourns _and_ wastes away, Lebanon is shamed _and_ withers; Sharon is like a desert plain, And Bashan and Carmel [^g]lose _their foliage_. 







###### 10 



"Now I will arise," says the LORD, "Now I will be exalted, now I will be lifted up. 







###### 11 



You have conceived [^h]chaff, you will give birth to stubble; [^i]My breath will consume you like a fire. 







###### 12 



The peoples will be burned to lime, Like cut thorns which are burned in the fire. 







###### 13 



"You who are far away, hear what I have done; And you who are near, [^j]acknowledge My might." 







###### 14 



Sinners in Zion are terrified; Trembling has seized the godless. "Who among us can live with the consuming fire? Who among us can live with everlasting burning?" 







###### 15 



One who walks righteously and speaks with integrity, One who rejects [^k]unjust gain And shakes his hands so that they hold no bribe; One who stops his ears from hearing about bloodshed And shuts his eyes from looking at evil; 







###### 16 



He will dwell on the heights, His refuge will be the [^l]impregnable rock; His bread will be given _him_, His water will be sure. 







###### 17 



Your eyes will see the King in His beauty; They will see a distant land. 







###### 18 



Your heart will meditate on terror: "Where is one who counts? Where is one who weighs? Where is one who counts the towers?" 







###### 19 



You will no longer see a fierce people, A people of [^m]unintelligible speech [^n]which no one comprehends, Of a stammering tongue [^o]which no one understands. 







###### 20 



Look at Zion, the city of our appointed feasts; Your eyes will see Jerusalem, an undisturbed settlement, A tent which will not be folded; Its stakes will never be pulled up, Nor any of its ropes be torn apart. 







###### 21 



But there the majestic _One_, the LORD, will be for us A place of rivers _and_ wide canals On which no boat with oars will go, And on which no mighty ship will pass-- 







###### 22 



For the LORD is our judge, The LORD is our lawgiver, The LORD is our king; He will save us-- 







###### 23 



Your _ship's_ tackle hangs slack; It cannot hold the base of its mast firmly, Nor spread out the sail. Then the prey of an abundant spoil will be divided; Those who limp will take the plunder. 







###### 24 



And no resident will say, "I am sick"; The people who live [^p]there will be forgiven _their_ wrongdoing. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

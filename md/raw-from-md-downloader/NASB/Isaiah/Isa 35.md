# Isaiah 35

***








###### 1 



The wilderness and the desert will rejoice, And the [^a]desert will shout for joy and blossom; Like the crocus 







###### 2 



It will blossom profusely And rejoice with joy and jubilation. The glory of Lebanon will be given to it, The majesty of Carmel and Sharon. They will see the glory of the LORD, The majesty of our God. 







###### 3 



Strengthen the [^b]exhausted, and make the [^c]feeble strong. 







###### 4 



Say to those with anxious heart, "Take courage, fear not. Behold, your God will come _with_ vengeance; The retribution of God will come, But He will save you." 







###### 5 



Then the eyes of those who are blind will be opened, And the ears of those who are deaf will be unstopped. 







###### 6 



Then those who limp will leap like a deer, And the tongue of those who cannot speak will shout for joy. For waters will burst forth in the wilderness, And streams in the [^d]desert. 







###### 7 



The [^e]scorched land will become a pool And the thirsty ground springs of water; In the haunt of jackals, its resting place, Grass _becomes_ reeds and rushes. 







###### 8 



A highway will be there, a roadway, And it will be called the Highway of Holiness. The unclean will not travel on it, But it _will_ be for the one who walks _that_ way, And fools will not wander _on it_. 







###### 9 



No lion will be there, Nor will any vicious animal go up on it; [^f]They will not be found there. But the redeemed will walk _there_, 







###### 10 



And the redeemed of the LORD will return And come to Zion with joyful shouting, And everlasting joy will be on their heads. They will obtain gladness and joy, And sorrow and sighing will flee away. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

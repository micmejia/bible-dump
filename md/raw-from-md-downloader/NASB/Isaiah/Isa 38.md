# Isaiah 38

***








###### 1 



In those days Hezekiah became [^a]mortally ill. And Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, came to him and said to him, "This is what the LORD says: 'Set your house in order, for you are going to die and not live.'" 







###### 2 



Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD, 







###### 3 



and said, "Please, LORD, just remember how I have walked before You wholeheartedly and in truth, and have done what is good in Your sight." And Hezekiah wept [^b]profusely. 







###### 4 



Then the word of the LORD came to Isaiah, saying, 







###### 5 



"Go and say to Hezekiah, 'This is what the LORD, the God of your father David says: "I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; behold, I will add fifteen years to your [^c]life. 







###### 6 



And I will save you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will protect this city."' 







###### 7 



"And this shall be the sign to you from the LORD, that the LORD will perform this word that He has spoken: 







###### 8 



Behold, I will make the shadow on the stairway, which has gone down with the sun on the stairway of Ahaz, go back ten steps." So the sun's _shadow_ went back ten steps on the stairway on which it had gone down. 







###### 9 



_This is_ a writing of Hezekiah king of Judah after his illness and [^d]recovery: 







###### 10 



I said, "In the middle of my [^e]life I am to enter the gates of Sheol; I have been deprived of the rest of my years." 







###### 11 



I said, "I will not see the LORD, The LORD in the land of the living; I will no longer look on mankind among the inhabitants of the world. 







###### 12 



Like a shepherd's tent my dwelling is pulled up and removed from me; As a weaver I rolled up my life. He cuts me off from the loom; From day until night You make an end of me. 







###### 13 



I composed _my soul_ until morning. Like a lion--so He breaks all my bones, From day until night You make an end of me. 







###### 14 



Like a swallow, _like_ a crane, so I twitter; I moan like a dove; My eyes look wistfully to the heights; Lord, I am oppressed, be my security. 







###### 15 



"What shall I say? [^f]For He has spoken to me, and He Himself has done it; I will walk [^g]quietly all my years because of the bitterness of my soul. 







###### 16 



Lord, by _these_ things _people_ live, And in all these is the life of my spirit; [^h]Restore me to health and let me live! 







###### 17 



Behold, for _my own_ welfare I had great bitterness; But You have [^i]kept my soul from the pit of [^j]nothingness, For You have hurled all my sins behind Your back. 







###### 18 



For Sheol cannot thank You, Death cannot praise You; Those who go down to the pit cannot hope for Your faithfulness. 







###### 19 



It is the living who give thanks to You, as I do today; A father tells his sons about Your faithfulness. 







###### 20 



The LORD is _certain_ to save me; So we will play my songs on stringed instruments All _the_ days of our life at the house of the LORD." 







###### 21 



Now Isaiah had said, "Have them take a cake of figs and apply it to the boil, so that he may recover." 







###### 22 



Then Hezekiah had said, "What is the sign that I will go up to the house of the LORD?" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

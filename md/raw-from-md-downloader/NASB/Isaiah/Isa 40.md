# Isaiah 40

***








###### 1 



"Comfort, comfort My people," says your God. 







###### 2 



"Speak [^a]kindly to Jerusalem; And call out to her, that her [^b]warfare has ended, That her [^c]guilt has been removed, That she has received of the LORD's hand Double for all her sins." 







###### 3 



The voice of one calling out, "Clear the way for the LORD in the wilderness; Make [^d]straight in the desert a highway for our God. 







###### 4 



Let every valley be lifted up, And every mountain and hill be made low; And let the uneven ground become a plain, And the rugged terrain a broad valley; 







###### 5 



[^e]Then the glory of the LORD will be revealed, And all flesh will see _it_ together; For the mouth of the LORD has spoken." 







###### 6 



A voice says, "Call out." Then [^f]he answered, "What shall I call out?" All flesh is grass, and all its [^g]loveliness is like the flower of the field. 







###### 7 



The grass withers, the flower fades, [^h]When the breath of the LORD blows upon it; The people are indeed grass! 







###### 8 



The grass withers, the flower fades, But the word of our God stands forever. 







###### 9 



Go up on a high mountain, Zion, messenger of good news, Raise your voice forcefully, Jerusalem, messenger of good news; Raise _it_ up, do not fear. Say to the cities of Judah, "Here is your God!" 







###### 10 



Behold, the Lord [^i]God will come with might, With His arm ruling for Him. Behold, His compensation is with Him, And His reward before Him. 







###### 11 



Like a shepherd He will tend His flock, In His arm He will gather the lambs And carry _them_ in the fold of His robe; He will gently lead the nursing _ewes_. 







###### 12 



Who has measured the [^j]waters in the hollow of His hand, And measured the heavens with a [^k]span, And [^l]calculated the dust of the earth with a measure, And weighed the mountains in a balance And the hills in a pair of scales? 







###### 13 



Who has [^m]directed the Spirit of the LORD, Or as His counselor has informed Him? 







###### 14 



With whom did He consult and _who_ gave Him understanding? And _who_ taught Him in the path of justice and taught Him knowledge, And informed Him of the way of understanding? 







###### 15 



Behold, the nations are like a drop from a bucket, And are regarded as a speck of dust on the scales; Behold, He lifts up the [^n]islands like fine dust. 







###### 16 



Even Lebanon is not enough to [^o]burn, Nor its animals enough for a burnt offering. 







###### 17 



All the nations are as nothing before Him, They are regarded by Him as less than nothing and [^p]meaningless. 







###### 18 



To whom then will you liken God? Or what likeness will you compare with Him? 







###### 19 



_As for_ the [^q]idol, a craftsman casts it, A goldsmith plates it with gold, And a silversmith _fashions_ chains of silver. 







###### 20 



He who is too impoverished for _such_ an offering Selects a tree that does not rot; He seeks out for himself a skillful craftsman To [^r]prepare [^s]an idol that will not totter. 







###### 21 



Do you not know? Have you not heard? Has it not been declared to you from the beginning? Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth? 







###### 22 



It is He who [^t]sits above the [^u]circle of the earth, And its inhabitants are like grasshoppers, Who stretches out the heavens like a curtain And spreads them out like a tent to live in. 







###### 23 



_It is_ He who reduces rulers to nothing, Who makes the judges of the earth [^v]meaningless. 







###### 24 



[^w]Scarcely have they been planted, [^x]Scarcely have they been sown, [^y]Scarcely has their stock taken root in the earth, But He merely blows on them, and they wither, And the storm carries them away like stubble. 







###### 25 



"To whom then will you compare Me That I would be _his_ equal?" says the Holy One. 







###### 26 



Raise your eyes on high And see who has created these _stars_, The One who brings out their [^z]multitude by number, He calls them all by name; Because of the greatness of His might and the [^aa]strength of _His_ power, Not one _of them_ is missing. 







###### 27 



Why do you say, Jacob, and you assert, Israel, "My way is hidden from the LORD, And the justice due me [^ab]escapes the notice of my God"? 







###### 28 



Do you not know? Have you not heard? The Everlasting God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth Does not become weary or tired. His understanding is unsearchable. 







###### 29 



He gives strength to the weary, And to _the one who_ lacks might He increases power. 







###### 30 



Though youths grow weary and tired, And vigorous young men stumble badly, 







###### 31 



Yet those who [^ac]wait for the LORD Will gain new strength; They will [^ad]mount up _with_ wings like eagles, They will run and not get tired, They will walk and not become weary. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

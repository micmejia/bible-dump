# Isaiah 42

***








###### 1 



"Behold, My Servant, whom I [^a]uphold; My chosen one _in whom_ My soul delights. I have put My Spirit upon Him; He will bring forth justice to the [^b]nations. 







###### 2 



He will not cry out nor raise _His voice_, Nor make His voice heard in the street. 







###### 3 



A bent reed He will not break _off_ And a dimly burning wick He will not extinguish; He will faithfully bring forth justice. 







###### 4 



He will not be disheartened or crushed Until He has established justice on the earth; And the coastlands will wait expectantly for His [^c]law." 







###### 5 



This is what God the LORD says, Who created the heavens and stretched them out, Who spread out the earth and its [^d]offspring, Who gives breath to the people on it And spirit to those who walk in it: 







###### 6 



"I am the LORD, I have called You in righteousness, I will also hold You by the hand and watch over You, And I will appoint You as a covenant to the people, As a light to the nations, 







###### 7 



To open blind eyes, To bring out prisoners from the dungeon And those who dwell in darkness from the prison. 







###### 8 



I am the LORD, that is My name; I will not give My glory to another, Nor My praise to idols. 







###### 9 



Behold, the former things have come to pass, Now I declare new things; Before they sprout I proclaim _them_ to you." 







###### 10 



Sing to the LORD a new song, _Sing_ His praise from the end of the earth! You who go down to the sea, and all that is in it; You islands, and those who live on them. 







###### 11 



Let the wilderness and its cities raise _their voices_, The settlements which Kedar inhabits. Let the inhabitants of Sela sing aloud, Let them shout for joy from the tops of the mountains. 







###### 12 



Let them give glory to the LORD And declare His praise in the coastlands. 







###### 13 



The LORD will go out like a warrior, He will stir _His_ zeal like a man of war. He will shout, indeed, He will raise a war cry. He will prevail against His enemies. ## The Blindness of the People 







###### 14 



"I have kept silent for a long time, I have kept still and restrained Myself. _Now_ like a woman in labor I will groan, I will both gasp and pant. 







###### 15 



I will lay waste the mountains and hills And wither all their vegetation; I will turn the rivers into coastlands And dry up the ponds. 







###### 16 



I will lead those who are blind by a way they have not known, In paths they have not known I will guide them. I will turn darkness into light before them And uneven land into plains. These are the things I will do, And I will not leave them undone." 







###### 17 



They will be turned back _and_ be utterly put to shame, Who trust in [^e]idols, Who say to cast metal images, "You are our gods." 







###### 18 



Hear, you who are deaf! And look, you who are blind, so that you may see. 







###### 19 



Who is blind but My servant, Or so deaf as My messenger whom I send? Who is so blind as one who is [^f]at peace _with Me_, Or so blind as the servant of the LORD? 







###### 20 



You have seen many things, but you do not retain _them_; _Your_ ears are open, but no one hears. 







###### 21 



The LORD was pleased for His righteousness' sake To make the Law great and glorious. 







###### 22 



But this is a people plundered and pillaged; All of them are trapped in [^g]caves, Or are hidden away in prisons; They have become plunder, with no one to save _them_, _And_ spoils with no one to say, "Give _them_ back!" 







###### 23 



Who among you will listen to this? _Who_ will pay attention and listen in the time to come? 







###### 24 



Who gave Jacob up for spoils, and Israel to plunderers? Was it not the LORD, against whom we have sinned, And in whose ways they were not willing to walk, And whose Law they did not obey? 







###### 25 



So He poured out on him the heat of His anger And the fierceness of battle; And it set him aflame all around, Yet he did not recognize _it_; And it burned him, but he [^h]paid no attention. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

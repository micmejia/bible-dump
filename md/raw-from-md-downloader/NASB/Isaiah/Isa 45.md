# Isaiah 45

***








###### 1 



This is what the LORD says to Cyrus His anointed, Whom I have taken by the right hand, To subdue nations before him And [^a]to undo _the weapons belt on_ the waist of kings; To open doors before him so that gates will not be shut: 







###### 2 



"I will go before you and make the [^b]rough places smooth; I will shatter the doors of bronze and cut through their iron bars. 







###### 3 



I will give you the [^c]treasures of darkness And hidden wealth of secret places, So that you may know that it is I, The LORD, the God of Israel, who calls you by your name. 







###### 4 



For the sake of Jacob My servant, And Israel My chosen _one_, I have also called you by your name; I have given you a title of honor Though you have not known Me. 







###### 5 



I am the LORD, and there is no one else; There is no God except Me. I will [^d]arm you, though you have not known Me, 







###### 6 



So that _people_ may know from the rising to the setting of the sun That there is no one besides Me. I am the LORD, and there is no one else, 







###### 7 



The One forming light and creating darkness, Causing [^e]well-being and creating disaster; I am the LORD who does all these things. ## God's Supreme Power 







###### 8 



"Drip down, heavens, from above, And let the clouds pour down righteousness; Let the earth open up and salvation bear fruit, And righteousness sprout with it. I, the LORD, have created it. 







###### 9 



"Woe to _the one_ who quarrels with [^f]his Maker-- A piece of pottery [^g]among the _other_ earthenware pottery pieces! Will the clay say to the [^h]potter, 'What are you doing?' Or the thing you are making _say_, 'He has no hands'? 







###### 10 



Woe to him who says to a father, 'What are you fathering?' Or to a woman, 'To what are you [^i]giving birth?'" 







###### 11 



This is what the LORD says, the Holy One of Israel and [^j]his Maker: "[^k]Ask Me about the things to come [^l]concerning My sons, And you shall commit to Me the work of My hands. 







###### 12 



It is I who made the earth, and created mankind upon it. I stretched out the heavens with My hands, And I [^m]ordained all their [^n]lights. 







###### 13 



I have stirred him in righteousness, And I will make all his ways smooth. He will build My city and let My exiles go free, Without any payment or reward," says the LORD of armies. 







###### 14 



This is what the LORD says: "The [^o]products of Egypt and the merchandise of [^p]Cush And the Sabeans, men of stature, Will come over to you and will be yours; They will walk behind you, they will come over in chains And will bow down to you; They will plead with you: '[^q]God certainly is [^r]with you, and there is no one else, No other God.'" 







###### 15 



Truly, You are a God who hides Himself, God of Israel, Savior! 







###### 16 



They will be put to shame and even humiliated, all of them; The manufacturers of idols will go away together in humiliation. 







###### 17 



Israel has been saved by the LORD With an everlasting salvation; You will not be put to shame or humiliated To all eternity. 







###### 18 



For this is what the LORD says, _He_ who created the heavens (He is the God who formed the earth and made it, He established it _and_ did not create it [^s]as a waste place, _but_ formed it to be inhabited): "I am the LORD, and there is no one else. 







###### 19 



I have not spoken in secret, In [^t]some dark land; I did not say to the [^u]offspring of Jacob, 'Seek Me in [^v]a wasteland'; I, the LORD, speak righteousness, Declaring things that are right. 







###### 20 



"Gather yourselves and come; Come together, you survivors of the nations! They have no knowledge, Who carry around [^w]their wooden idol And pray to a god who cannot save. 







###### 21 



Declare and present _your case_; Indeed, let them consult together. Who has announced this long ago? Who has long since declared it? Is it not I, the LORD? And there is no other God besides Me, A righteous God and a Savior; There is none except Me. 







###### 22 



Turn to Me and be saved, all the ends of the earth; For I am God, and there is no other. 







###### 23 



I have sworn by Myself; The word has gone out from My mouth in righteousness And will not turn back, That to Me every knee will bow, every tongue will swear _allegiance_. 







###### 24 



They will say of Me, 'Only in the LORD are righteousness and strength.' _People_ will come to Him, And all who were angry at Him will be put to shame. 







###### 25 



In the LORD all the offspring of Israel Will be justified and will boast." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

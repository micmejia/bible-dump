# Isaiah 46

***








###### 1 



Bel has bowed down, Nebo stoops over; Their idols have become _loads_ for the animals and the cattle. The things [^a]that you carry are burdensome, A load for the weary _animal_. 







###### 2 



They stooped over, they have bowed down together; They could not rescue the burden, But [^b]have themselves gone into captivity. 







###### 3 



"Listen to Me, house of Jacob, And all the remnant of the house of Israel, You who have been carried _by Me_ from [^c]birth And have been carried from the womb; 







###### 4 



Even to _your_ old age I [^d]will be the same, And even to _your_ [^e]graying years I will [^f]carry _you_! I have [^g]done _it_, and I will bear _you_; And I will [^h]carry _you_ and I will save _you_. 







###### 5 



"To whom would you liken Me And make Me equal, and compare Me, That we would be alike? 







###### 6 



Those who lavish gold from the bag And weigh silver on the scale, Hire a goldsmith, and he makes it _into_ a god; They bow down, indeed they worship it. 







###### 7 



They lift it on the shoulder, carry it, And set it in its place, and it stands _there_. It does not move from its place. Though one may shout to it, it cannot answer; It cannot save him from his distress. 







###### 8 



"Remember this, and be [^i]assured; Recall it to [^j]mind, you wrongdoers. 







###### 9 



Remember the former things long past, For I am God, and there is no other; _I am_ God, and there is no one like Me, 







###### 10 



Declaring the end from the beginning, And from ancient times things which have not been done, Saying, 'My plan will be established, And I will accomplish all My good pleasure'; 







###### 11 



Calling a bird of prey from the east, The man of [^k]My purpose from a distant country. Truly I have spoken; truly I will bring it to pass. I have planned _it_, I will certainly do it. 







###### 12 



"Listen to Me, you stubborn-minded, Who are far from righteousness. 







###### 13 



I bring near My righteousness, it is not far off; And My salvation will not delay. And I will grant salvation in Zion, _And_ My glory for Israel. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

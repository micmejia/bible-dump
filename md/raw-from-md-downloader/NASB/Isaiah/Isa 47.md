# Isaiah 47

***








###### 1 



"Come down and sit in the dust, Virgin daughter of Babylon; Sit on the ground without a throne, Daughter of the Chaldeans! For you will no longer be called tender and delicate. 







###### 2 



Take the millstones and grind flour. Remove your veil, strip off the skirt, Uncover the leg, cross the rivers. 







###### 3 



Your nakedness will be uncovered, Your shame will also be exposed; I will take vengeance and will not spare anyone." 







###### 4 



Our Redeemer, the LORD of armies is His name, The Holy One of Israel. 







###### 5 



"Sit silently, and go into darkness, Daughter of the Chaldeans; For you will no longer be called The queen of kingdoms. 







###### 6 



I was angry with My people, I profaned My heritage And handed them over to you. You did not show mercy to them, On the aged you made your yoke very heavy. 







###### 7 



Yet you said, 'I will be a queen forever.' These things you did not consider Nor remember the outcome of [^a]them. 







###### 8 



"Now, then, hear this, you luxuriant one, Who lives securely, Who says in her heart, 'I am, and there is no one besides me. I will not sit as a widow, Nor know the loss of children.' 







###### 9 



But these two things will come on you suddenly in one day: Loss of children and widowhood. They will come on you in full measure In spite of your many sorceries, In spite of the great power of your spells. 







###### 10 



You felt secure in your wickedness and said, 'No one sees me,' Your wisdom and your knowledge, [^b]they have led you astray; For you have said in your heart, 'I am, and there is no one besides me.' 







###### 11 



But evil will come on you Which you will not know how to charm away; And disaster will fall on you For which you cannot atone; And destruction about which you do not know Will come on you suddenly. 







###### 12 



"Persist now in your spells And in your many sorceries With which you have labored from your youth; Perhaps you will be able to benefit, Perhaps you may cause trembling. 







###### 13 



You are wearied with your many counsels; Let now the astrologers, Those who prophesy by the stars, Those who predict by the new moons, Stand up and save you from what will come upon you. 







###### 14 



Behold, they have become like stubble, Fire burns them; They cannot save themselves from the power of the flame; There will be no coal to warm by _Nor_ a fire to sit before! 







###### 15 



So have those become to you with whom you have labored, Those who have done business with you from your youth; Each has wandered in his own [^c]way; There is no one to save you. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

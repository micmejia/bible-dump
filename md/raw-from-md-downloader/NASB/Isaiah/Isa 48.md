# Isaiah 48

***








###### 1 



"Hear this, house of Jacob, who are named Israel And who came from the waters of Judah, Who swear by the name of the LORD And invoke the God of Israel, _But_ not in truth nor in righteousness. 







###### 2 



For they name themselves after the holy city, And lean on the God of Israel; The LORD of armies is His name. 







###### 3 



I declared the former things long ago, And they went out of My mouth, and I proclaimed them. Suddenly I acted, and they came to pass. 







###### 4 



Because I know that you are [^a]obstinate, And your neck is an iron tendon And your forehead bronze, 







###### 5 



Therefore I declared _them_ to you long ago, Before [^b]they took place I proclaimed _them_ to you, So that you would not say, 'My idol has done them, And my carved image and my cast metal image have commanded them.' 







###### 6 



You have heard; look at all this. And you, will you not declare it? I proclaim to you new things from this time, Hidden things which you have not known. 







###### 7 



They are created now and not long ago; And before today you have not heard them, So that you will not say, 'Behold, I knew them.' 







###### 8 



You have not heard, you have not known. Even from long ago your ear has not been open, Because I knew that you would deal very treacherously; And you have been called a [^c]rebel from [^d]birth. 







###### 9 



For the sake of My name I delay My wrath, And _for_ My praise I restrain _it_ for you, In order not to cut you off. 







###### 10 



Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver; I have tested you in the furnace of affliction. 







###### 11 



For My own sake, for My own sake, I will act; For how can _My name_ be profaned? And I will not give My glory to another. ## Rescue Promised 







###### 12 



"Listen to Me, Jacob, Israel [^e]whom I called; I am He, I am the first, I am also the last. 







###### 13 



Assuredly My hand founded the earth, And My right hand spread out the heavens; When I call to them, they stand together. 







###### 14 



Assemble, all of you, and listen! Who among them has declared these things? The LORD loves him; he will carry out His good pleasure against Babylon, And His arm _will be against_ the Chaldeans. 







###### 15 



I, _yes_ I, have spoken; indeed I have called him, I have brought him, and He will make his ways successful. 







###### 16 



Come near to Me, listen to this: From the beginning I have not spoken in secret, From the time it took place, I was there. And now the Lord [^f]God has sent Me, and His Spirit." 







###### 17 



This is what the LORD says, _He who is_ your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: "I am the LORD your God, who teaches you to benefit, Who leads you in the way you should go. 







###### 18 



If only you had paid attention to My commandments! Then your [^g]well-being would have been like a river, And your righteousness like the waves of the sea. 







###### 19 



Your [^h]descendants would have been like the sand, And [^i]your offspring like its grains; Their name would never be eliminated or destroyed from My presence." 







###### 20 



Go out from Babylon! Flee from the Chaldeans! Declare with the sound of joyful shouting, proclaim this, Send it out to the end of the earth; Say, "The LORD has redeemed His servant Jacob." 







###### 21 



They did not thirst when He led them through the deserts. He made the water flow out of the rock for them; He split the rock and the water gushed out. 







###### 22 



"There is no peace for the wicked," says the LORD. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

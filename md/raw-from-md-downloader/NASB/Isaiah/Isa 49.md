# Isaiah 49

***








###### 1 



Listen to Me, you islands, And pay attention, you peoples from afar. The LORD called Me from the womb; From the [^a]body of My mother He named Me. 







###### 2 



He has made My mouth like a sharp sword, In the shadow of His hand He has concealed Me; And He has also made Me a sharpened arrow, He has hidden Me in His quiver. 







###### 3 



He said to Me, "You are My Servant, Israel, In whom I will show My glory." 







###### 4 



But I said, "I have labored in vain, I have spent My strength for nothing and futility; Nevertheless, the justice _due_ to Me is with the LORD, And My reward is with My God." 







###### 5 



And now says the LORD, who formed Me from the womb to be His Servant, To bring Jacob back to Him, so that Israel might be gathered to Him (For I am honored in the sight of the LORD, And My God is My strength), 







###### 6 



He says, "It is too [^b]small a thing that You should be My Servant To raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the protected ones of Israel; I will also make You a light [^c]of the nations So that My salvation may [^d]reach to the end of the earth." 







###### 7 



This is what the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel _and_ its Holy One, Says to the [^e]despised One, To the One abhorred by the nation, To the Servant of rulers: "Kings will see and arise, Princes will also bow down, Because of the LORD who is faithful, the Holy One of Israel who has chosen You." 







###### 8 



This is what the LORD says: "At a favorable time I answered You, And on a day of salvation I helped You; And I will watch over You and make You a covenant of the people, To [^f]restore the land, to give as inheritances the deserted hereditary lands; 







###### 9 



Saying to those who are bound, '[^g]Go free,' To those who are in darkness, 'Show yourselves.' They will feed along the roads, And their pasture _will be_ on all bare heights. 







###### 10 



They will not hunger or thirst, Nor will the scorching heat or sun strike them down; For He who has compassion on them will lead them, And He will guide them to springs of water. 







###### 11 



I will make all My mountains a road, And My highways will be raised up. 







###### 12 



Behold, these will come from afar; And behold, these _will come_ from the north and from the west, And these from the land of Aswan." 







###### 13 



Shout for joy, you heavens! And rejoice, you earth! Break forth into joyful shouting, mountains! For the LORD has comforted His people And will have compassion on His afflicted. ## Promise to Zion 







###### 14 



But Zion said, "The LORD has abandoned me, And the Lord has forgotten me." 







###### 15 



"Can a woman forget her nursing child And have no compassion on the son of her womb? Even these may forget, but I will not forget you. 







###### 16 



Behold, I have inscribed you on the palms _of My hands_; Your walls are continually before Me. 







###### 17 



Your [^h]builders hurry; Your destroyers and devastators Will leave you. 







###### 18 



Raise your eyes and look around; All of them gather together, they come to you. As I live," declares the LORD, "You will certainly put them all on as [^i]jewelry and bind them on as a bride. 







###### 19 



For your ruins and deserted places and your destroyed land-- Now you will certainly be too cramped for the inhabitants, And those who swallowed you will be far away. 







###### 20 



The children [^j]you lost will yet say in your ears, 'The place is too cramped for me; Make room for me that I may live _here_.' 







###### 21 



Then you will say in your heart, 'Who has fathered these for me, Since I have been bereaved of my children And cannot conceive, _and I am_ an exile, and a wanderer? And who has raised these? Behold, I was left alone; [^k]Where are these from?'" 







###### 22 



This is what the Lord [^l]God says: "Behold, I will lift up My hand to the nations And set up My flag to the peoples; And they will bring your sons [^m]in their arms, And your daughters will be carried on _their_ shoulders. 







###### 23 



Kings will be your guardians, And their princesses your nurses. They will bow down to you with their faces to the ground And lick the dust from your feet; And you will know that I am the LORD; Those who hopefully wait for Me will not be put to shame. 







###### 24 



"Can the prey be taken from a mighty man, Or the captives of [^n]a tyrant be rescued?" 







###### 25 



Indeed, this is what the LORD says: "Even the captives of the mighty man will be taken away, And the prey of a tyrant will be rescued; For I will contend with the one who contends with you, And I will save your sons. 







###### 26 



I will feed your oppressors with their own flesh, And they will become drunk with their own blood as with sweet wine; And [^o]humanity will know that I, the LORD, am your Savior And your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

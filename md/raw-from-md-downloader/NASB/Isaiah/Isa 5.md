# Isaiah 5

***








###### 1 



Let me sing now for my beloved A song of my beloved about His vineyard. My beloved had a vineyard on [^a]a fertile hill. 







###### 2 



He dug it all around, cleared it of stones, And planted it with [^b]the choicest vine. And He built a tower in the middle of it, And also carved out a [^c]wine vat in it; Then He expected _it_ to produce _good_ grapes, But it produced _only_ [^d]worthless ones. 







###### 3 



"And now, you inhabitants of Jerusalem and people of Judah, Judge between Me and My vineyard. 







###### 4 



What more was there to do for My vineyard [^e]that I have not done in it? Why, _when_ I expected _it_ to produce _good_ grapes did it produce [^f]worthless ones? 







###### 5 



So now let Me tell you what I am going to do to My vineyard: I will remove its hedge and it will be consumed; I will break down its wall and it will become trampled ground. 







###### 6 



I will lay it waste; It will not be pruned nor hoed, But briars and thorns will come up. I will also command the clouds not to rain on it." 







###### 7 



For the vineyard of the LORD of armies is the house of Israel, And the people of Judah are His delightful plant. So He waited for justice, but behold, _there was_ bloodshed; For righteousness, but behold, a cry for help. ## Woes for the Wicked 







###### 8 



Woe to those who attach house to house _and_ join field to field, Until there is no more room, And you alone are a landowner in the midst of the land! 







###### 9 



In my ears the LORD of armies _has sworn_, "Many houses shall certainly become desolate, _Even_ great and fine ones, without occupants. 







###### 10 



For ten acres of vineyard will yield _only_ one [^g]bath _of wine_, And a [^h]homer of seed will yield _only_ an [^i]ephah of grain." 







###### 11 



Woe to those who rise early in the morning so that they may pursue intoxicating drink, Who stay up late in the evening so that wine may inflame them! 







###### 12 



Their banquets are _accompanied by_ lyre and harp, _by_ tambourine and flute, and _by_ wine; But they do not pay attention to the deeds of the LORD, Nor do they consider the work of His hands. 







###### 13 



Therefore My people go into exile for their lack of knowledge; And their [^j]nobles are famished, And their multitude is parched with thirst. 







###### 14 



Therefore Sheol has enlarged its [^k]throat and opened its mouth beyond measure; And [^l]Jerusalem's splendor, her multitude, her noise _of revelry_, and the jubilant within her, descend _into it_. 







###### 15 



So _the common_ people will be humbled and _the_ person _of importance_ brought low, The eyes of the haughty also will be brought low. 







###### 16 



But the LORD of armies will be exalted in judgment, And the holy God will show Himself holy in righteousness. 







###### 17 



Then the lambs will graze as in their pasture, And strangers will eat in the ruins of the [^m]wealthy. 







###### 18 



Woe to those who drag wrongdoing with the cords of [^n]deceit, And sin as if with cart ropes; 







###### 19 



Who say, "Let Him hurry, let Him do His work quickly, so that we may see _it_; And let the plan of the Holy One of Israel approach And come to pass, so that we may know _it_!" 







###### 20 



Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil; Who [^o]substitute darkness for light and light for darkness; Who [^p]substitute bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter! 







###### 21 



Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes And [^q]clever in their own sight! 







###### 22 



Woe to those who are heroes in drinking wine, And valiant men in mixing intoxicating drink, 







###### 23 



Who declare the wicked innocent for a bribe, And take away the [^r]rights of the ones who are in the right! 







###### 24 



Therefore, as a tongue of fire consumes stubble, And dry grass collapses in the flame, So their root will become like rot, and their blossom [^s]blow away like dust; For they have rejected the Law of the LORD of armies, And discarded the word of the Holy One of Israel. 







###### 25 



For this reason the anger of the LORD has burned against His people, And He has stretched out His hand against them and struck them. And the mountains quaked, and their corpses [^t]lay like refuse in the middle of the streets. Despite all this, His anger [^u]is not spent, But His hand is still stretched out. 







###### 26 



He will also lift up a flag to the distant [^v]nation, And whistle for it from the ends of the earth; And behold, it will come with speed swiftly. 







###### 27 



No one in it is tired or stumbles, No one slumbers or sleeps; Nor is the undergarment at his waist loosened, Nor his sandal strap broken. 







###### 28 



[^w]Its arrows are sharp and all its bows are bent; The hoofs of its horses [^x]seem like flint, and its _chariot_ wheels like a storm wind. 







###### 29 



Its roaring is like a lioness, and it roars like young lions; It growls as it seizes the prey And carries _it_ off with no one to save _it_. 







###### 30 



And it will roar against it on that day like the roaring of the sea. If one looks across to the land, behold, there is darkness _and_ distress; Even the light is darkened by its clouds. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Isaiah 52

***








###### 1 



Awake, awake, Clothe yourself in your strength, Zion; Clothe yourself with your beautiful garments, Jerusalem, the holy city; For the uncircumcised and the unclean Will no longer come into you. 







###### 2 



Shake yourself from the dust, rise up, Captive Jerusalem; Release yourself from the chains around your neck, Captive daughter of Zion. 







###### 3 



For this is what the LORD says: "You were sold for nothing, and you will be redeemed without money." 







###### 4 



For this is what the Lord [^a]God says: "My people went down to Egypt first to reside there; then the Assyrian oppressed them without reason. 







###### 5 



And now, what do I have here," declares the LORD, "seeing that My people have been taken away without reason?" _Again_ the LORD declares, "Those who rule over them howl, and My name is continually reviled all day long. 







###### 6 



Therefore, My people shall know My name; therefore on that day I am the one who is speaking, 'Here I am.'" 







###### 7 



How delightful on the mountains Are the feet of one who brings good news, Who announces [^b]peace And brings good news of [^c]happiness, Who announces salvation, _And_ says to Zion, "Your God [^d]reigns!" 







###### 8 



Listen! Your watchmen raise _their_ voices, They shout joyfully together; For they will see [^e]with their own eyes When the LORD restores Zion. 







###### 9 



Be cheerful, shout joyfully together, You ruins of Jerusalem; For the LORD has comforted His people, He has redeemed Jerusalem. 







###### 10 



The LORD has bared His holy arm In the sight of all the nations, [^f]So that all the ends of the earth may see The salvation of our God. 







###### 11 



Depart, depart, go out from there, Do not touch what is unclean; Go out of the midst of her, purify yourselves, You who carry the vessels of the LORD. 







###### 12 



But you will not go out in a hurry, Nor will you go [^g]as fugitives; For the LORD will go before you, And the God of Israel _will be_ your rear guard. ## The Exalted Servant 







###### 13 



Behold, My Servant will prosper, He will be high and lifted up and [^h]greatly exalted. 







###### 14 



Just as many were appalled at you, _My people_, So His appearance was marred beyond _that of a_ man, And His form beyond the sons of mankind. 







###### 15 



So [^i]He will sprinkle many nations, Kings will shut their mouths on account of Him; For what they had not been told, they will see, And what they had not heard, they will understand. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Isaiah 53

***








###### 1 



Who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed? 







###### 2 



For He grew up before Him like a tender [^a]shoot, And like a root out of dry ground; He has no _stately_ form or majesty That we would look at Him, Nor an appearance that we would take pleasure in Him. 







###### 3 



He was despised and abandoned by men, A man of [^b]great pain and familiar with sickness; And like one from whom _people_ hide their faces, He was despised, and we had no regard for Him. 







###### 4 



However, _it was_ our sicknesses _that_ He Himself bore, And our pains _that_ He carried; Yet we ourselves assumed that He had been afflicted, Struck down by God, and humiliated. 







###### 5 



But He was [^c]pierced for our offenses, He was crushed for our wrongdoings; The punishment for our [^d]well-being _was laid_ upon Him, And by His wounds we are healed. 







###### 6 



All of us, like sheep, have gone astray, Each of us has turned to his own way; But the LORD has caused the wrongdoing of us all To [^e]fall on Him. 







###### 7 



He was oppressed and afflicted, Yet He did not open His mouth; Like a lamb that is led to slaughter, And like a sheep that is silent before its shearers, So He did not open His mouth. 







###### 8 



By oppression and judgment He was taken away; And as for His generation, who considered That He was cut off from the land of the [^f]living _For_ the wrongdoing of my people, to whom the blow _was due_? 







###### 9 



And His grave was assigned with wicked men, Yet He was with a rich man in His death, Because He had done no violence, Nor was there any deceit in His mouth. 







###### 10 



But the LORD desired To crush Him, [^g]causing _Him_ grief; If He renders [^h]Himself _as_ a guilt offering, He will see _His_ [^i]offspring, He will prolong _His_ days, And the [^j]good pleasure of the LORD will prosper in His hand. 







###### 11 



As a result of the [^k]anguish of His soul, He will [^l]see _it and_ be satisfied; By His knowledge the Righteous One, My Servant, will justify the many, For He will bear their wrongdoings. 







###### 12 



Therefore, I will allot Him a portion with the great, And He will divide the plunder with the strong, Because He poured out His [^m]life unto death, And was counted with wrongdoers; Yet He Himself bore the sin of many, And interceded for the wrongdoers. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

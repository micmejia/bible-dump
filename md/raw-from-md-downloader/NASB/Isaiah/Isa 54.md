# Isaiah 54

***








###### 1 



"Shout for joy, infertile one, you who have not given birth _to any child_; Break forth into joyful shouting and cry aloud, you who have not been in labor; For the sons of the desolate one _will be_ more numerous Than the sons of the married woman," says the LORD. 







###### 2 



"Enlarge the place of your tent; [^a]Stretch out the curtains of your dwellings, do not spare _them_; Lengthen your ropes And strengthen your pegs. 







###### 3 



For you will spread out to the right and to the left. And your [^b]descendants will possess nations And will resettle the desolate cities. 







###### 4 



"Fear not, for you will not be put to shame; And do not feel humiliated, for you will not be disgraced; But you will forget the shame of your youth, And no longer remember the disgrace of your widowhood. 







###### 5 



For your husband is your Maker, Whose name is the LORD of armies; And your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel, Who is called the God of all the earth. 







###### 6 



For the LORD has called you, Like a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit, Even like a wife of _one's_ youth when she is rejected," Says your God. 







###### 7 



"[^c]For a brief moment I abandoned you, But with great compassion I will gather you. 







###### 8 



In an [^d]outburst of anger I hid My face from you for a moment, But with everlasting favor I will have compassion on you," Says the LORD your Redeemer. 







###### 9 



"For [^e]this is like the days of Noah to Me, When I swore that the waters of Noah Would not [^f]flood the earth again; So I have sworn that I will not be angry with you Nor rebuke you. 







###### 10 



For the mountains may be removed and the hills may shake, But My [^g]favor will not be removed from you, Nor will My covenant of peace be shaken," Says the LORD who has compassion on you. 







###### 11 



"Afflicted one, storm-tossed, _and_ not comforted, Behold, I will set your stones in antimony, And I will lay your foundations with [^h]sapphires. 







###### 12 



Moreover, I will make your battlements of [^i]rubies, And your gates of [^j]crystal, And your entire [^k]wall of precious stones. 







###### 13 



All your sons will be [^l]taught by the LORD; And the well-being of your sons will be great. 







###### 14 



In righteousness you will be established; You will be far from oppression, for you will not fear; And from terror, for it will not come near you. 







###### 15 



If anyone fiercely attacks _you_, it will not be from Me. Whoever attacks you will fall because of you. 







###### 16 



Behold, I Myself have created the smith who blows on the fire of coals And produces a weapon for its work; And I have created the destroyer to inflict ruin. 







###### 17 



No weapon that is formed against you will succeed; And you will condemn every tongue that [^m]accuses you in judgment. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, And their vindication is from Me," declares the LORD. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Isaiah 55

***








###### 1 



"[^a]You there! Everyone who thirsts, come to the waters; And you who have no [^b]money come, buy and eat. Come, buy wine and milk Without money and without cost. 







###### 2 



Why do you [^c]spend money for what is not bread, And your wages for what does not satisfy? Listen carefully to Me, and eat what is good, And delight yourself in abundance. 







###### 3 



Incline your ear and come to Me. Listen, that [^d]you may live; And I will make an everlasting covenant with you, _According to_ the faithful mercies [^e]shown to David. 







###### 4 



Behold, I have made him a witness to the peoples, A leader and commander for the peoples. 







###### 5 



Behold, you will call a nation you do not know, And a nation which does not know you will run to you, Because of the LORD your God, the Holy One of Israel; For He has glorified you." 







###### 6 



Seek the LORD while He may be found; Call upon Him while He is near. 







###### 7 



Let the wicked abandon his way, And the unrighteous person his thoughts; And let him return to the LORD, And He will have compassion on him, And to our God, For He will abundantly pardon. 







###### 8 



"For My thoughts are not your thoughts, Nor are your ways My ways," declares the LORD. 







###### 9 



"For _as_ the heavens are higher than the earth, So are My ways higher than your ways And My thoughts than your thoughts. 







###### 10 



For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven, And do not return there without watering the earth And making it produce and sprout, And providing seed to the sower and bread to the eater; 







###### 11 



So will My word be which goes out of My mouth; It will not return to Me empty, Without accomplishing what I desire, And without succeeding _in the purpose_ for which I sent it. 







###### 12 



For you will go out with joy And be led in peace; The mountains and the hills will break into shouts of joy before you, And all the trees of the field will clap _their_ hands. 







###### 13 



Instead of the thorn bush, the juniper will come up, And instead of the stinging nettle, the myrtle will come up; And [^f]it will be a [^g]memorial to the LORD, An everlasting sign which will not be eliminated." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

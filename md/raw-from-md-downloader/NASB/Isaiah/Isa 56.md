# Isaiah 56

***








###### 1 



This is what the LORD says: "Guard justice and do righteousness, For My salvation is about to come And My righteousness to be revealed. 







###### 2 



Blessed is a man who does this, And a son of man who takes hold of it; Who keeps from profaning the Sabbath, And keeps his hand from doing any evil." 







###### 3 



Let not the foreigner who has joined himself to the LORD say, "The LORD will certainly separate me from His people." Nor let the eunuch say, "Behold, I am a dry tree." 







###### 4 



For this is what the LORD says: "To the eunuchs who keep My Sabbaths, And choose what pleases Me, And hold firmly to My covenant, 







###### 5 



To them I will give in My house and within My walls a memorial, And a name better than that of sons and daughters; I will give [^a]them an everlasting name which will not be eliminated. 







###### 6 



"Also the foreigners who join themselves to the LORD, To attend to His service and to love the name of the LORD, To be His servants, every one who keeps the Sabbath so as not to profane it, And holds firmly to My covenant; 







###### 7 



Even those I will bring to My holy mountain, And make them joyful in My house of prayer. Their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be acceptable on My altar; For My house will be called a house of prayer for all the peoples." 







###### 8 



The Lord [^b]God, who gathers the dispersed of Israel, declares, "I will yet gather _others_ to [^c]them, to those _already_ gathered." 







###### 9 



All you [^d]wild animals, All you animals in the forest, Come to eat. 







###### 10 



His watchmen are blind, All of them know nothing. All of them are mute dogs unable to bark, Dreamers lying down, who love to slumber; 







###### 11 



And the dogs are [^e]greedy, they [^f]are never satisfied. And they are shepherds who have no understanding; They have all turned to their own way, Each one to his unjust gain, [^g]without exception. 







###### 12 



"Come," _they say_, "[^h]let's get wine, and let's drink heavily of intoxicating drink; And tomorrow will be like today, only more so." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

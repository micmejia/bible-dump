# Isaiah 58

***








###### 1 



"Cry loudly, do not hold back; Raise your voice like a trumpet, And declare to My people their wrongdoing, And to the house of Jacob their sins. 







###### 2 



Yet they seek Me day by day and delight to know My ways, As a nation that has done righteousness And has not forsaken the ordinance of their God. They ask Me _for_ just decisions, They delight in the nearness of God. 







###### 3 



'Why have we fasted and You do not see? _Why_ have we humbled ourselves and You do not [^a]notice?' Behold, on the day of your fast you find _your_ desire, And oppress all your workers. 







###### 4 



Behold, you fast for contention and strife, and to strike with a wicked fist. You do not fast like _you have done_ today to make your voice heard on high! 







###### 5 



Is it a fast like this that I choose, a day for a person to humble himself? Is it for bowing [^b]one's head like a reed And for spreading out sackcloth and ashes as a bed? Will you call this a fast, even an acceptable day to the LORD? 







###### 6 



Is this not the fast that I choose: To release the bonds of wickedness, To undo the ropes of the yoke, And to let the oppressed go free, And break every yoke? 







###### 7 



Is it not to break your bread [^c]with the hungry And bring the homeless poor into the house; When you see the naked, to cover him; And not to hide yourself from your own flesh? 







###### 8 



Then your light will break out like the dawn, And your recovery will spring up quickly; And your righteousness will go before you; The glory of the LORD will be your rear guard. 







###### 9 



Then you will call, and the LORD will answer; You will cry for help, and He will say, 'Here I am.' If you remove the yoke from your midst, The [^d]pointing of the finger and speaking wickedness, 







###### 10 



And _if_ you offer yourself to the hungry And satisfy the [^e]need of the afflicted, Then your light will rise in darkness, And your gloom _will become_ like midday. 







###### 11 



And the LORD will continually guide you, And satisfy your [^f]desire in scorched places, And give strength to your bones; And you will be like a watered garden, And like a spring of water whose waters do not [^g]fail. 







###### 12 



Those from among you will rebuild the ancient ruins; You will raise up the age-old foundations; And you will be called the repairer of the breach, The restorer of the [^h]streets in which to dwell. ## Keeping the Sabbath 







###### 13 



"If, because of the Sabbath, you restrain your foot From doing as you wish on My holy day, And call the Sabbath a pleasure, _and_ the holy _day_ of the LORD honorable, And honor it, desisting from your _own_ ways, From seeking your _own_ pleasure And speaking _your own_ word, 







###### 14 



Then you will take delight in the LORD, And I will make you ride on the heights of the earth; And I will feed you _with_ the heritage of Jacob your father, For the mouth of the LORD has spoken." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Isaiah 59

***








###### 1 



Behold, the LORD's hand is not so short That it cannot save; Nor is His ear so dull That it cannot hear. 







###### 2 



But your wrongdoings have caused a separation between you and your God, And your sins have hidden _His_ [^a]face from you so that He does not hear. 







###### 3 



For your hands are defiled with blood, And your fingers with wrongdoing; Your lips have spoken deceit, Your tongue mutters wickedness. 







###### 4 



No one sues righteously and no one pleads [^b]honestly. They trust in confusion and speak lies; They conceive trouble and give birth to disaster. 







###### 5 



They hatch vipers' eggs and weave the spider's web; The one who eats of their eggs dies, And _from_ what is crushed, a snake breaks out. 







###### 6 



Their webs will not become clothing, Nor will they cover themselves with their works; Their works are works of wrongdoing, And an act of violence is in their [^c]hands. 







###### 7 



Their feet run to evil, And they hurry to shed innocent blood; Their thoughts are thoughts of wrongdoing, Devastation and destruction are in their paths. 







###### 8 



They do not know the way of peace, And there is no justice in their tracks; They have made their paths crooked, Whoever walks on [^d]them does not know peace. ## A Confession of Wickedness 







###### 9 



Therefore justice is far from us, And righteousness does not reach us; We hope for light, but there is darkness, For brightness, but we walk in gloom. 







###### 10 



We grope for the wall like people who are blind, We grope like those who have no eyes. We stumble at midday as in the twilight; Among those who are healthy _we are_ like the dead. 







###### 11 



All of us growl like bears, And moan sadly like doves; We hope for justice, but there is none; For salvation, _but_ it is far from us. 







###### 12 



For our wrongful acts have multiplied before You, And our sins have testified against us; For our wrongful acts are with us, And [^e]we know our wrongdoings: 







###### 13 



[^f]Offending and denying the LORD, And turning away from our God, Speaking oppression and revolt, Conceiving and uttering lying words from the heart. 







###### 14 



Justice is turned back, And righteousness stands far away; For truth has stumbled in the street, And uprightness cannot enter. 







###### 15 



Truth is lacking, And one who turns aside from evil makes himself a prey. Now the LORD saw, And it was [^g]displeasing in His sight that there was no justice. 







###### 16 



And He saw that there was no one, And was amazed that there was not one to intercede; Then His own arm brought salvation to Him, And His righteousness upheld Him. 







###### 17 



He put on righteousness like a breastplate, And a helmet of salvation on His head; And He put on garments of vengeance for clothing And wrapped Himself with zeal as a cloak. 







###### 18 



According to _their_ deeds, [^h]so will He repay: Wrath to His adversaries, [^i]retribution to His enemies; To the coastlands He will [^j]deal [^k]retribution. 







###### 19 



So they will fear the name of the LORD from the west And His glory from the rising of the sun, For He will come like a [^l]rushing stream Which the wind of the LORD drives. 







###### 20 



"A Redeemer will come to Zion, And to those in Jacob who turn from wrongdoing," declares the LORD. 







###### 21 



"As for Me, this is My covenant with them," says the LORD: "My Spirit who is upon you, and My words which I have put in your mouth shall not depart from your mouth, nor from the mouth of your [^m]offspring, nor from the mouth of your [^n]offspring's offspring," says the LORD, "from now and forever." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

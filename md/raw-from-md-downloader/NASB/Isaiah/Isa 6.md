# Isaiah 6

***








###### 1 



In the year of King Uzziah's death I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, lofty and exalted, with the train of His robe filling the temple. 







###### 2 



Seraphim were standing above Him, each having six wings: with two _each_ covered his face, and with two _each_ covered his feet, and with two _each_ flew. 







###### 3 



And one called out to another and said, "Holy, Holy, Holy, is the LORD of armies. The [^a]whole earth is full of His glory." 







###### 4 



And the [^b]foundations of the thresholds trembled at the voice of him who called out, while the [^c]temple was filling with smoke. 







###### 5 



Then I said, "Woe to me, for I am ruined! Because I am a man of unclean lips, And I live among a people of unclean lips; For my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of armies." 







###### 6 



Then one of the seraphim flew to me with a burning coal in his hand, which he had taken from the altar with tongs. 







###### 7 



He touched my mouth _with it_ and said, "Behold, this has touched your lips; and your guilt is taken away and atonement is made for your sin." ## Isaiah's Commission 







###### 8 



Then I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, "Whom shall I send, and who will go for Us?" Then I said, "Here am I. Send me!" 







###### 9 



And He said, "Go, and tell this people: 'Keep on listening, but do not understand; And keep on looking, but do not gain knowledge.' 







###### 10 



Make the hearts of this people [^d]insensitive, Their ears [^e]dull, And their eyes [^f]blind, So that they will not see with their eyes, Hear with their ears, Understand with their hearts, And return and be healed." 







###### 11 



Then I said, "Lord, how long?" And He answered, "Until cities are devastated _and_ without inhabitant, Houses are without people And the land is utterly desolate, 







###### 12 



The LORD has completely removed people, And there [^g]are many forsaken places in the midst of the land. 







###### 13 



Yet there will still be a tenth portion in it, And it will again be _subject_ to burning, Like a terebinth or an oak Whose stump remains when it is cut down. The holy seed is its stump." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

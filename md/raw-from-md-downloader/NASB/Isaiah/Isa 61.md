# Isaiah 61

***








###### 1 



The Spirit of the Lord [^a]God is upon me, Because the LORD anointed me To bring good news to the humble; He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, To proclaim [^b]release to captives And [^c]freedom to prisoners; 







###### 2 



To proclaim the favorable year of the LORD And the day of vengeance of our God; To comfort all who mourn, 







###### 3 



To grant those who mourn _in_ Zion, Giving them a garland instead of ashes, The oil of gladness instead of mourning, The cloak of praise instead of a disheartened spirit. So they will be called [^d]oaks of righteousness, The planting of the LORD, that He may be glorified. 







###### 4 



Then they will rebuild the ancient ruins, They will raise up the former devastations; And they will repair the ruined cities, The desolations of many generations. 







###### 5 



Strangers will stand and pasture your flocks, And [^e]foreigners will be your farmers and your vinedressers. 







###### 6 



But you will be called the priests of the LORD; You will be spoken of _as_ ministers of our God. You will eat the wealth of nations, And you will boast in their [^f]riches. 







###### 7 



Instead of your shame _you will have a_ double _portion_, And _instead of_ humiliation they will shout for joy over their portion. Therefore they will possess a double _portion_ in their land, Everlasting joy will be theirs. 







###### 8 



For I, the LORD, love justice, I hate robbery [^g]in the burnt offering; And I will faithfully give them their reward, And make an everlasting covenant with them. 







###### 9 



Then their offspring will be known among the nations, And their descendants in the midst of the peoples. All who see them will recognize them Because they are the offspring _whom_ the LORD has blessed. 







###### 10 



I will rejoice greatly in the LORD, My soul will be joyful in my God; For He has clothed me with garments of salvation, He has wrapped me with a robe of righteousness, As a groom puts on a turban, And as a bride adorns herself with her jewels. 







###### 11 



For as the earth produces its sprouts, And as a garden causes the things sown in it to spring up, So the Lord [^h]God will cause righteousness and praise To spring up before all the nations. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Isaiah 62

***








###### 1 



For Zion's sake I will not keep silent, And for Jerusalem's sake I will not keep quiet, Until her righteousness goes forth like brightness, And her salvation like a torch that is burning. 







###### 2 



The nations will see your righteousness, And all kings your glory; And you will be called by a new name Which the mouth of the LORD will designate. 







###### 3 



You will also be a crown of beauty in the hand of the LORD, And a royal headband in the hand of your God. 







###### 4 



It will no longer be said to you, "[^a]Forsaken," Nor to your land will it any longer be said, "[^b]Desolate"; But you will be called, "[^c]My delight is in her," And your land, "[^d]Married"; For the LORD delights in you, And _to Him_ your land will be married. 







###### 5 



For _as_ a young man marries a virgin, _So_ your sons will marry you; And _as_ the [^e]groom rejoices over the bride, _So_ your God will rejoice over you. 







###### 6 



On your walls, Jerusalem, I have appointed watchmen; All day and all night they will never keep silent. You who profess the LORD, take no rest for yourselves; 







###### 7 



And give Him no rest until He establishes And makes Jerusalem an object of praise on the earth. 







###### 8 



The LORD has sworn by His right hand and by His mighty arm: "I will never again give your grain _as_ food for your enemies, Nor will [^f]foreigners drink your new wine for which you have labored." 







###### 9 



But those who harvest it will eat it and praise the LORD; And those who gather it will drink it in the courtyards of My sanctuary. 







###### 10 



Go through, go through the gates, Clear a way [^g]for the people! Build up, build up the highway, Remove the stones, lift up a flag over the peoples. 







###### 11 



Behold, the LORD has proclaimed to the end of the earth: Say to the daughter of Zion, "Behold, your salvation is coming; Behold His reward is with Him, and His compensation before Him." 







###### 12 



And they will call them, "The holy people, The redeemed of the LORD"; And you will be called, "Sought Out, A City Not Abandoned." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

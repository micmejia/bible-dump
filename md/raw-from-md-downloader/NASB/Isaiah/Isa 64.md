# Isaiah 64

***








###### 1 



[^a]Oh, that You would tear open the heavens _and_ come down, That the mountains would quake at Your presence-- 







###### 2 



[^b]As fire kindles brushwood, _as_ fire causes water to boil-- To make Your name known to Your adversaries, _That_ the nations may tremble at Your presence! 







###### 3 



When You did awesome things which we did not expect, You came down, the mountains quaked at Your presence. 







###### 4 



For from days of old they have not heard or perceived by ear, Nor has the eye seen a God besides You, Who acts in behalf of one who waits for Him. 







###### 5 



You meet him who rejoices in doing righteousness, Who remembers You in Your ways. Behold, You were angry, for we sinned, _We continued_ in [^c]our sins for a long time; Yet shall we be saved? 







###### 6 



For all of us have become like one who is unclean, And all our righteous deeds are like a filthy garment; And all of us wither like a leaf, And our wrongdoings, like the wind, take us away. 







###### 7 



There is no one who calls on Your name, Who stirs himself to take hold of You; For You have hidden Your face from us And have [^d]surrendered us to the power of our wrongdoings. 







###### 8 



But now, LORD, You are our Father; We are the clay, and You our potter, And all of us are the work of Your hand. 







###### 9 



Do not be angry beyond measure, LORD, Nor remember wrongdoing forever. Behold, please look, all of us are Your people. 







###### 10 



Your holy cities have become a wilderness, Zion has become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation. 







###### 11 



Our holy and beautiful house, Where our fathers praised You, Has been burned _by_ fire; And all our precious things have become a ruin. 







###### 12 



Will You restrain Yourself at these things, LORD? Will You keep silent and afflict us beyond measure? ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

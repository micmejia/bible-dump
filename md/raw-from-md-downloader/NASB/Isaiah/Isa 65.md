# Isaiah 65

***








###### 1 



"I permitted Myself to be sought by those who did not ask _for Me_; I permitted Myself to be found by those who did not seek Me. I said, 'Here am I, here am I,' To a nation which did not call on My name. 







###### 2 



I have spread out My hands all day long to a rebellious people, Who walk _in_ the way which is not good, [^a]following their own thoughts, 







###### 3 



A people who continually provoke Me to My face, Offering sacrifices in gardens and burning incense on bricks; 







###### 4 



Who sit among graves and spend the night in secret places; Who eat pig's flesh, And the broth of unclean meat is _in_ their pots. 







###### 5 



Who say, 'Keep to yourself, do not come near me, For I am holier than you!' These are smoke in My [^b]nostrils, A fire that burns all the day. 







###### 6 



Behold, it is written before Me: I will not keep silent, but I will repay; I will even repay [^c]into their laps, 







###### 7 



Both your own wrongdoings and the wrongdoings of your fathers together," says the LORD. "Because they have burned incense on the mountains And scorned Me on the hills, Therefore I will measure their former work [^d]into their laps." 







###### 8 



This is what the LORD says: "Just as the new wine is found in the cluster, And one says, 'Do not destroy it, for there is [^e]benefit in it,' So I will act in behalf of My servants In order not to destroy [^f]all of them. 







###### 9 



I will bring forth [^g]offspring from Jacob, And an heir of My mountains from Judah; My chosen ones shall inherit it, And My servants will live there. 







###### 10 



Sharon will be a pasture land for flocks, And the Valley of Achor a resting place for herds, For My people who seek Me. 







###### 11 



But as for you who abandon the LORD, Who forget My holy mountain, Who set a table for [^h]Fortune, And fill a jug of mixed wine for [^i]Destiny, 







###### 12 



I will destine you for the sword, And all of you will bow down to the slaughter. Because I called, but you did not answer; I spoke, but you did not listen. Instead, you did evil in My sight And chose that in which I did not delight." 







###### 13 



Therefore, this is what the Lord [^j]God says: "Behold, My servants will eat, but you will be hungry. Behold, My servants will drink, but you will be thirsty. Behold, My servants will rejoice, but you will be put to shame. 







###### 14 



Behold, My servants will shout joyfully with a glad heart, But you will cry out from a painful heart, And you will wail from a broken spirit. 







###### 15 



You will leave your name as a curse to My chosen ones, And the Lord [^k]God will put you to death. But [^l]My servants will be called by another name. 







###### 16 



Because the one who [^m]is blessed on the earth Will [^n]be blessed by the God of truth; And the one who swears _an oath_ on the earth Will swear by the God of truth; Because the former troubles are forgotten, And because they are hidden from My sight! ## New Heavens and a New Earth 







###### 17 



"For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; And the former things will not be remembered or come to [^o]mind. 







###### 18 



But be glad and rejoice forever in what I create; For behold, I create Jerusalem _for_ rejoicing And her people _for_ gladness. 







###### 19 



I will also rejoice in Jerusalem and be glad in My people; And there will no longer be heard in her The voice of weeping and the sound of crying. 







###### 20 



No longer will there be [^p]in it an infant _who lives only a few_ days, Or an old person who does not [^q]live out his days; For the youth will die at the age of a hundred, And the [^r]one who does not reach the age of a hundred Will be _thought_ accursed. 







###### 21 



They will build houses and inhabit _them_; They will also plant vineyards and eat their fruit. 







###### 22 



They will not build and another inhabit, They will not plant and another eat; For as the [^s]lifetime of a tree, _so will be_ the days of My people, And My chosen ones will fully enjoy the work of their hands. 







###### 23 



They will not labor in vain, Or give birth _to children_ for disaster; For they are the [^t]descendants of those blessed by the LORD, And their descendants with them. 







###### 24 



It will also come to pass that before they call, I will answer; while they are still speaking, I will listen. 







###### 25 



The wolf and the lamb will graze together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox; and dust will be the serpent's food. They will do no evil or harm on all My holy mountain," says the LORD. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

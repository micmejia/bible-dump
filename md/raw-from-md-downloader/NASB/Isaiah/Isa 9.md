# Isaiah 9

***








###### 1 



[^a]But there will be no _more_ gloom for her who was in anguish. In earlier times He treated the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali with contempt, but later on He will make _it_ glorious, by the way of the sea, on the other side of the Jordan, Galilee of the [^b]Gentiles. 







###### 2 



[^c]The people who walk in darkness Will see a great light; Those who live in a dark land, The light will shine on them. 







###### 3 



You will multiply the nation, You will [^d]increase [^e]their joy; They will rejoice in Your presence As with the joy [^f]of harvest, As _people_ rejoice when they divide the spoils. 







###### 4 



For You will break the yoke of their burden and the staff on their shoulders, The rod of their oppressor, as [^g]at the battle of Midian. 







###### 5 



For every boot of the marching warrior in the roar _of battle_, And cloak rolled in blood, will be for burning, fuel for the fire. 







###### 6 



For a Child will be born to us, a Son will be given to us; And the government will [^h]rest on His shoulders; And His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace. 







###### 7 



There will be no end to the increase of _His_ government or of peace On the throne of David and over [^i]his kingdom, To establish it and to uphold it with justice and righteousness From then on and forevermore. The zeal of the LORD of armies will accomplish this. ## God's Anger with Israel's Arrogance 







###### 8 



The Lord sends a [^j]message against Jacob, And it falls on Israel. 







###### 9 



And all the people know _it_, _That is_, Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria, Asserting in pride and in arrogance of heart: 







###### 10 



"The bricks have fallen down, But we will rebuild with smooth stones; The sycamores have been cut down, But we will replace _them_ with cedars." 







###### 11 



Therefore the LORD raises superior adversaries against them from Rezin And provokes their enemies, 







###### 12 



The Arameans from the east and the Philistines from the west; And they devour Israel with [^k]gaping jaws. In _spite of_ all this, His anger does not turn away, And His hand is still stretched out. 







###### 13 



Yet the people do not turn back to Him who struck them, Nor do they seek the LORD of armies. 







###### 14 



So the LORD cuts off head and tail from Israel, _Both_ palm branch and bulrush in a single day. 







###### 15 



The head is the elder and esteemed man, And the prophet who teaches falsehood is the tail. 







###### 16 



For those who guide this people are leading _them_ astray; And those who are guided by them are [^l]confused. 







###### 17 



Therefore the Lord does not rejoice over their young men, Nor does He have compassion on their [^m]orphans or their widows; For every one of them is godless and an evildoer, And every mouth is speaking foolishness. In _spite of_ all this, His anger does not turn away, And His hand is still stretched out. 







###### 18 



For wickedness burns like a fire; It consumes briars and thorns; It also sets the thickets of the forest aflame And they roll upward in a column of smoke. 







###### 19 



By the wrath of the LORD of armies the land is burned, And the people are like fuel for the fire; No one spares his brother. 







###### 20 



[^n]They devour _what is_ on the right hand but are _still_ hungry, And [^o]they eat _what is_ on the left hand, but they are not satisfied; Each of them eats the flesh of his own arm. 







###### 21 



Manasseh _devours_ Ephraim, and Ephraim Manasseh, _And_ together they are against Judah. In _spite of_ all this, His anger does not turn away And His hand is still stretched out. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

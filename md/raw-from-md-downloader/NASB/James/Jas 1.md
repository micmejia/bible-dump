# James 1

***








###### 1 



[^a]James, a bond-servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, To the twelve tribes who are [^b]dispersed abroad: Greetings. 







###### 2 



Consider it all joy, my brothers _and sisters_, when you encounter various [^c]trials, 







###### 3 



knowing that the testing of your faith produces [^d]endurance. 







###### 4 



And let [^e]endurance have _its_ perfect [^f]result, so that you may be [^g]perfect and complete, lacking in nothing. 







###### 5 



But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and [^h]without reproach, and it will be given to him. 







###### 6 



But he must ask in faith without any doubting, for the one who doubts is like the surf of the sea, driven and tossed by the wind. 







###### 7 



For that person ought not to expect that he will receive anything from the Lord, 







###### 8 



_being_ a [^i]double-minded man, unstable in all his ways. 







###### 9 



Now the brother _or sister_ of humble _circumstances_ is to glory in his high position; 







###### 10 



but the rich person _is to glory_ in his [^j]humiliation, because like [^k]flowering grass he will pass away. 







###### 11 



For the sun rises with its scorching heat and withers the grass; and its flower falls off and the beauty of its appearance is destroyed; so also the rich person, in the midst of his pursuits, will die out. 







###### 12 



Blessed is a man who perseveres under trial; for once he has [^l]been approved, he will receive the crown of life which _the Lord_ has promised to those who love Him. 







###### 13 



No one is to say when he is tempted, "I am being tempted [^m]by God"; for God cannot be tempted [^n]by evil, and He Himself does not tempt anyone. 







###### 14 



But each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lust. 







###### 15 



Then when lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it has run its course, brings forth death. 







###### 16 



Do not be [^o]deceived, my beloved brothers _and sisters_. 







###### 17 



Every good thing given and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or [^p]shifting shadow. 







###### 18 



In the exercise of His will He gave us birth by the word of truth, so that we would be [^q]a kind of first fruits [^r]among His creatures. 







###### 19 



[^s]You know _this_, my beloved brothers _and sisters_. Now everyone must be quick to hear, slow to speak, _and_ slow to anger; 







###### 20 



for a man's anger does not bring about the righteousness of God. 







###### 21 



Therefore, ridding _yourselves_ of all filthiness and _all_ [^t]that remains of wickedness, in [^u]humility receive the word implanted, which is able to save your souls. 







###### 22 



But prove yourselves doers of the word, and not just hearers who deceive themselves. 







###### 23 



For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his [^v]natural face in a mirror; 







###### 24 



for _once_ he has looked at himself and gone away, [^w]he has immediately forgotten what kind of person he was. 







###### 25 



But one who has looked intently at the perfect law, the _law_ of freedom, and has continued _in it_, not having become a forgetful hearer but [^x]an active doer, this person will be blessed in [^y]what he does. 







###### 26 



If anyone thinks himself to be religious, yet does not [^z]bridle his tongue but deceives his _own_ heart, this person's religion is worthless. 







###### 27 



Pure and undefiled religion in the sight of _our_ God and Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their distress, _and_ to keep oneself unstained [^aa]by the world. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

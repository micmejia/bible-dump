# James 2

***








###### 1 



My brothers _and sisters_, do not hold your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ with _an attitude of_ personal favoritism. 







###### 2 



For if a man comes into your [^a]assembly with a gold ring _and is dressed_ in bright clothes, and a poor man in dirty clothes also comes in, 







###### 3 



and you [^b]pay special attention to the one who is wearing the bright clothes, and say, "You sit here in a good _place_," and you say to the poor man, "You stand over there, or sit down by my footstool," 







###### 4 



have you not made distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with evil [^c]motives? 







###### 5 



Listen, my beloved brothers _and sisters_: did God not choose the poor [^d]of this world _to be_ rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which He promised to those who love Him? 







###### 6 



But you have dishonored the poor man. Is it not the rich who oppress you and [^e]personally drag you into [^f]court? 







###### 7 



Do they not blaspheme the good name [^g]by which you have been called? 







###### 8 



If, however, you are fulfilling the [^h]royal law according to the Scripture, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself," you are doing well. 







###### 9 



But if you show partiality, you are committing sin _and_ are convicted by the Law as violators. 







###### 10 



For whoever keeps the whole Law, yet stumbles in one _point_, has become guilty of all. 







###### 11 



For He who said, "Do not commit adultery," also said, "Do not murder." Now if you do not commit adultery, but do murder, you have become a violator of the Law. 







###### 12 



So speak, and so act, as those who are to be judged by _the_ law of freedom. 







###### 13 



For judgment _will be_ merciless to one who has shown no mercy; mercy [^i]triumphs over judgment. ## Faith and Works 







###### 14 



What use is it, my brothers _and sisters_, if someone says he has faith, but he has no works? Can [^j]that faith save him? 







###### 15 



If a brother or sister is without clothing and in need of daily food, 







###### 16 



and one of you says to them, "Go in peace, [^k]be warmed and be filled," yet you do not give them what is necessary for _their_ body, what use is that? 







###### 17 



In the same way, faith also, if it has no works, is [^l]dead, _being_ by itself. 







###### 18 



But someone [^m]may _well_ say, "You have faith and I have works; show me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works." 







###### 19 



You believe that [^n]God is one. You do well; the demons also believe, and shudder. 







###### 20 



But are you willing to acknowledge, you foolish person, that faith without works is useless? 







###### 21 



Was our father Abraham not justified by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar? 







###### 22 



You see that faith was working with his works, and [^o]as a result of the works, faith was [^p]perfected; 







###### 23 



and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, "And Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness," and he was called a friend of God. 







###### 24 



You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone. 







###### 25 



In the same way, was Rahab the prostitute not justified by works also when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way? 







###### 26 



For just as the body without _the_ spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

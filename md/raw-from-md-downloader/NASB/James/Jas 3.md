# James 3

***








###### 1 



Do not become teachers in large numbers, my brothers, since you know that we _who are teachers_ will incur a [^a]stricter judgment. 







###### 2 



For we all stumble in many _ways_. If anyone does not stumble in [^b]what he says, he is a perfect man, able to [^c]rein in the whole body as well. 







###### 3 



Now if we put the bits into the horses' mouths so that they will obey us, we direct their whole body as well. 







###### 4 



Look at the ships too: though they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are _nevertheless_ directed by a very small rudder wherever the inclination of the pilot determines. 







###### 5 



So also the tongue is a small part _of the body_, and _yet_ it boasts of great things. See how great a forest is set aflame by such a small fire! 







###### 6 



And the tongue is a fire, the _very_ world of unrighteousness; the tongue is set among [^d]our body's parts as that which defiles the whole body and sets on fire the course of _our_ [^e]life, and is set on fire by [^f]hell. 







###### 7 



For every [^g]species of beasts and birds, of reptiles and creatures of the sea, is tamed and has been tamed by the human [^h]race. 







###### 8 



But no one _among_ mankind can tame the tongue; _it is_ a restless evil, full of deadly poison. 







###### 9 



With it we bless _our_ Lord and Father, and with it we curse people, who have been made in the likeness of God; 







###### 10 



from the same mouth come _both_ blessing and cursing. My brothers _and sisters_, these things should not be this way. 







###### 11 



Does a spring send out from the same opening _both_ [^i]fresh and bitter _water_? 







###### 12 



Can a fig tree, my brothers _and sisters_, bear olives, or a vine _bear_ figs? Nor _can_ salt water produce [^j]fresh. ## Wisdom from Above 







###### 13 



Who among you is wise and understanding? Let him show by his good behavior his deeds in the gentleness of wisdom. 







###### 14 



But if you have bitter jealousy and [^k]selfish ambition in your heart, do not be arrogant and _so_ lie against the truth. 







###### 15 



This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, [^l]natural, demonic. 







###### 16 



For where jealousy and [^m]selfish ambition exist, [^n]there is disorder and every evil thing. 







###### 17 



But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peace-loving, gentle, [^o]reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, [^p]impartial, free of hypocrisy. 







###### 18 



And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace [^q]by those who make peace. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

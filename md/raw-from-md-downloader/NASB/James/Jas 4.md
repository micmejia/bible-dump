# James 4

***








###### 1 



[^a]What is the source of quarrels and conflicts among you? [^b]Is the source not your pleasures that wage war in [^c]your body's parts? 







###### 2 



You lust and do not have, _so_ you commit murder. And you are envious and cannot obtain, _so_ you fight and quarrel. You do not have because you do not ask. 







###### 3 



You ask and do not receive, because you ask [^d]with the wrong motives, so that you may spend _what you request_ [^e]on your pleasures. 







###### 4 



You adulteresses, do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Therefore whoever wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God. 







###### 5 



Or do you think that the Scripture says to no purpose, "[^f]He [^g]jealously desires the Spirit whom He has made to dwell in us"? 







###### 6 



But He gives a greater grace. Therefore _it_ says, "God is opposed to the proud, but gives grace to the humble." 







###### 7 



Submit therefore to God. But [^h]resist the devil, and he will flee from you. 







###### 8 



Come close to God and He will come close to you. Cleanse _your_ hands, you sinners; and purify _your_ hearts, you [^i]double-minded. 







###### 9 



Be miserable, and mourn, and weep; let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your joy into gloom. 







###### 10 



Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord, and He will exalt you. 







###### 11 



Do not speak against one another, brothers _and sisters_. The one who speaks against a brother _or sister_, or judges his brother _or sister_, speaks against the law and judges the law; but if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge _of it_. 







###### 12 



There is _only_ one Lawgiver and Judge, the One who is able to save and to destroy; but who are you, [^j]judging your neighbor? 







###### 13 



Come now, you who say, "Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a city, and spend a year there and engage in business and make a profit." 







###### 14 



[^k]Yet you do not know [^l]what your life will be like tomorrow. For you are _just_ a vapor that appears for a little while, and then vanishes away. 







###### 15 



[^m]Instead, _you ought_ to say, "If the Lord wills, we will live and also do this or that." 







###### 16 



But as it is, you boast in your [^n]arrogance; all such boasting is evil. 







###### 17 



So for one who knows _the_ [^o]right thing to do and does not do it, for him it is sin. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# James 5

***








###### 1 



Come now, you rich people, weep and howl for your miseries which are coming upon you. 







###### 2 



Your riches have rotted and your garments have become moth-eaten. 







###### 3 



Your gold and your silver have corroded, and their corrosion will [^a]serve as a testimony against you and will consume your flesh like fire. It is in the last days that you have stored up your treasure! 







###### 4 



Behold, the pay of the laborers who mowed your fields, _and_ which has been withheld by you, cries out _against you_; and the outcry of those who did the harvesting has reached the ears of the Lord [^b]of armies. 







###### 5 



You have [^c]lived for pleasure on the earth and lived luxuriously; you have [^d]fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter. 







###### 6 



You have condemned and [^e]put to death the righteous person; he offers you no resistance. ## Exhortation 







###### 7 



Therefore be patient, brothers _and sisters_, until the coming of the Lord. The farmer waits for the precious produce of the soil, being patient about it, until [^f]it gets the early and late rains. 







###### 8 



You too be patient; strengthen your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is near. 







###### 9 



Do not [^g]complain, brothers _and sisters_, against one another, so that you may not be judged; behold, the Judge is standing [^h]right at the [^i]door. 







###### 10 



As an example, brothers _and sisters_, of suffering and patience, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord. 







###### 11 



We count those blessed who endured. You have heard of the [^j]endurance of Job and have seen the [^k]outcome of the Lord's dealings, that the Lord is full of compassion and _is_ merciful. 







###### 12 



But above all, my brothers _and sisters_, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or with any other oath; but [^l]your yes is to be yes, and your no, no, so that you do not fall under judgment. 







###### 13 



Is anyone among you suffering? _Then_ he must pray. Is anyone cheerful? He is to sing praises. 







###### 14 



Is anyone among you sick? _Then_ he must call for the elders of the church and they are to pray over him, [^m]anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord; 







###### 15 



and the prayer of faith will [^n]restore the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up, and if he has committed sins, [^o]they will be forgiven him. 







###### 16 



Therefore, confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another so that you may be healed. A [^p]prayer of a righteous person, when it is [^q]brought about, can accomplish much. 







###### 17 



Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed [^r]earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months. 







###### 18 



Then he prayed again, and the sky [^s]poured rain and the earth produced its fruit. 







###### 19 



My brothers _and sisters_, if anyone among you strays from the truth and someone turns him back, 







###### 20 



let him know that the one who has turned a sinner from the error of his way will save his soul from death and cover a multitude of sins. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

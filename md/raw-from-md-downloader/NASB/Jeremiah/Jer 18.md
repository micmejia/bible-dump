# Jeremiah 18

***








###### 1 



The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, 







###### 2 



"Arise and go down to the potter's house, and there I will announce My words to you." 







###### 3 



So I went down to the potter's house, and there he was, making something on the wheel. 







###### 4 



But the vessel that he was making of clay was spoiled in the hand of the potter; so he remade it into another vessel, as it pleased the potter to make. 







###### 5 



Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 







###### 6 



"Am I not able, house of Israel, to deal with you as this potter _does_?" declares the LORD. "Behold, like the clay in the potter's hand, so are you in My hand, house of Israel. 







###### 7 



At one moment I might speak concerning a nation or concerning a kingdom to uproot _it_, to tear _it_ down, or to destroy _it_; 







###### 8 



if that nation against which I have spoken turns from its evil, I will relent of the disaster that I planned to bring on it. 







###### 9 



Or at _another_ moment I might speak concerning a nation or concerning a kingdom to build up or to plant _it_; 







###### 10 



if it does evil in My sight by not obeying My voice, then I will relent of the good with which I said [^a]that I would bless it. 







###### 11 



So now, speak to the men of Judah and against the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, 'This is what the LORD says: "Behold, I am forming a disaster against you and devising a plan against you. Now turn back, each of you from his evil way, and [^b]correct your ways and your deeds!"' 







###### 12 



But they will say, 'It's hopeless! For we are going to follow our own plans, and each of us will [^c]persist in the stubbornness of his evil heart.' 







###### 13 



"Therefore this is what the LORD says: 'Just ask among the nations, Who _ever_ heard _anything_ like [^d]this? The virgin of Israel Has done a most appalling thing. 







###### 14 



Does the snow of Lebanon leave the rock of the open country alone? Or is the cold flowing water _from_ a foreign _land_ ever dried up? 







###### 15 



For My people have forgotten Me, They burn incense [^e]to worthless _gods_. And they [^f]have stumbled in their ways, In the ancient roads, To walk on paths, Not on a highway, 







###### 16 



To make their land a desolation, _An object of_ perpetual hissing; Everyone who passes by it will be astonished And shake his head. 







###### 17 



Like an east wind I will scatter them Before the enemy; I will [^g]show them My back and not _My_ face In the day of their disaster.'" 







###### 18 



Then they said, "Come and let's devise plans against Jeremiah. Certainly the Law is not going to be lost by the priest, nor advice by the wise, nor _the divine_ word by the prophet! Come, and let's strike at him with _our_ tongue, and let's pay no attention to any of his words." 







###### 19 



Give _Your_ attention to me, LORD, And listen to [^h]what my opponents are saying! 







###### 20 



Should good be repaid with evil? For they have dug a pit for [^i]me. Remember how I stood before You To speak good in their behalf, So as to turn Your wrath away from them. 







###### 21 



Therefore, give their children over to famine And turn them over to the [^j]power of the sword; And let their wives become childless and widowed. Let their men also be slaughtered to death, Their young men struck and killed by the sword in battle. 







###### 22 



May a cry be heard from their houses When You suddenly bring raiders upon them; For they have dug a pit to capture me And hidden snares for my feet. 







###### 23 



But You, LORD, know All their [^k]deadly schemes against me; Do not [^l]forgive their wrongdoing Or wipe out their sin from Your sight. But may they be [^m]overthrown before You; Deal with them in the time of Your anger! ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

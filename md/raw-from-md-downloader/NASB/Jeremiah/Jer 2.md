# Jeremiah 2

***








###### 1 



Now the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 







###### 2 



"Go and proclaim in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, 'This is what the LORD says: "I remember regarding you the [^a]devotion of your youth, Your love when you were a bride, Your following after Me in the wilderness, Through a land not sown. 







###### 3 



Israel was holy to the LORD, The first of His harvest. All who ate of it became guilty; Evil came upon them," declares the LORD.'" 







###### 4 



Hear the word of the LORD, house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel. 







###### 5 



This is what the LORD says: "What injustice did your fathers find in Me, That they went far from Me, And walked after emptiness and became empty? 







###### 6 



They did not say, 'Where is the LORD Who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, Who led us through the wilderness, Through a land of deserts and of pits, Through a land of drought and of [^b]deep darkness, Through a land that no one crossed And where no person lived?' 







###### 7 



I brought you into the fruitful land To eat its fruit and its good things. But you came and defiled My land, And you made My inheritance an abomination. 







###### 8 



The priests did not say, 'Where is the LORD?' And those who handle the Law did not know Me; The [^c]rulers also revolted against Me, And the prophets prophesied by Baal And walked after things that were of no benefit. 







###### 9 



"Therefore I will still contend with you," declares the LORD, "And I will contend with your sons' sons. 







###### 10 



For cross to the coastlands of [^d]Kittim and see, And send to Kedar and observe closely, And see if there has been _anything_ like this! 







###### 11 



Has a nation changed gods, When they were not gods? But My people have exchanged their glory For that which is of no benefit. 







###### 12 



Be appalled at this, you heavens, And shudder, be very desolate," declares the LORD. 







###### 13 



"For My people have committed two evils: They have abandoned Me, The fountain of living waters, To carve out for themselves cisterns, Broken cisterns That do not hold water. 







###### 14 



"Is Israel a slave? Or is he a servant born in the home? Why has he become plunder? 







###### 15 



The young lions have roared at him, They have [^e]roared loudly. And they have made his land a waste; His cities have been destroyed, without inhabitant. 







###### 16 



Also the [^f]men of Memphis and Tahpanhes Have [^g]shaved your head. 







###### 17 



Have you not done this to yourself By your abandoning the LORD your God When He led you in the way? 







###### 18 



But now what are you doing on the road to Egypt, _Except_ to drink the waters of the [^h]Nile? Or what are you doing on the road to Assyria, _Except_ to drink the waters of the _Euphrates_ River? 







###### 19 



Your own wickedness will correct you, And your apostasies will punish you; Know therefore and see that it is evil and bitter For you to abandon the LORD your God, And the fear of Me is not in you," declares the Lord [^i]God of armies. 







###### 20 



"For long ago [^j]I broke your yoke _And_ tore off your restraints; But you said, 'I will not serve!' For on every high hill And under every leafy tree You have lain down as a prostitute. 







###### 21 



Yet I planted you as a choice vine, A completely faithful seed. How then have you turned yourself before Me Into the degenerate shoots of a foreign vine? 







###### 22 



Although you wash yourself with lye And [^k]use much soap, The stain of your guilt is before Me," declares the Lord [^l]God. 







###### 23 



"How can you say, 'I am not defiled, I have not gone after the Baals'? Look at your way in the valley! Know what you have done! You are a swift young camel running about senselessly on her ways, 







###### 24 



A wild donkey accustomed to the wilderness, That sniffs the wind in her passion. Who can turn her away _in_ her mating season? None who seek her will grow weary; In her month they will find her. 







###### 25 



Keep your feet from being bare, And your throat from thirst; But you said, 'It is [^m]hopeless! No! For I have loved strangers, And I will walk after them.' 







###### 26 



"Like the shame of a thief when he is discovered, So the house of Israel is shamed; They, their kings, their leaders, Their priests, and their prophets, 







###### 27 



Who say to a tree, 'You are my father,' And to a stone, 'You gave me birth.' For they have turned _their_ backs to Me, And not _their_ faces; But in the time of their [^n]trouble they will say, 'Arise and save us!' 







###### 28 



But where are your gods Which you made for yourself? Let them arise, if they can save you In the time of your [^o]trouble! For _as many as_ the number of your cities Are your gods, Judah. 







###### 29 



"Why do you contend with Me? You have all revolted against Me," declares the LORD. 







###### 30 



"In vain I have struck your sons; They did not accept discipline. Your sword has devoured your prophets Like a destroying lion. 







###### 31 



You generation, look to the word of the LORD. Have I been a wilderness to Israel, Or a land of thick darkness? Why do My people say, 'We _are free to_ roam; We will no longer come to You'? 







###### 32 



Can a virgin forget her jewelry, Or a bride her attire? Yet My people have forgotten Me For days without number. 







###### 33 



How well you prepare your way To seek love! Therefore even to the wicked women You have taught your ways. 







###### 34 



Also on your skirts is found The lifeblood of the innocent poor; You did not find them breaking in. But in spite of all these things, 







###### 35 



You said, 'I am innocent; Surely His anger is turned away from me.' Behold, I will enter into judgment with you Because you say, 'I have not sinned.' 







###### 36 



Why do you go around so much Changing your way? Also, you will be put to shame by Egypt, Just as you were put to shame by Assyria. 







###### 37 



From this _place_ as well you will go out With your hands on your head; For the LORD has rejected those in whom you trust, And you will not prosper with them." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

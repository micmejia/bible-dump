# Jeremiah 20

***








###### 1 



When Pashhur the priest, the son of Immer, who was chief overseer in the house of the LORD, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things, 







###### 2 



Pashhur had Jeremiah the prophet beaten and put him in the stocks that were at the upper Benjamin Gate, which was by the house of the LORD. 







###### 3 



Then on the next day, when Pashhur released Jeremiah from the stocks, Jeremiah said to him, "Pashhur is not the name the LORD has called you, but rather [^a]Magor-missabib. 







###### 4 



For this is what the LORD says: 'Behold, I am going to make you a horror to yourself and to all your friends; and while your eyes look on, they will fall by the sword of their enemies. So I will hand all Judah over to the king of Babylon, and he will take them away as exiles to Babylon and will kill them with the sword. 







###### 5 



I will also give all the wealth of this city, all its produce and all its valuable things--even all the treasures of the kings of Judah I will hand over to their enemies, and they will plunder them, take them away, and bring them to Babylon. 







###### 6 



And you, Pashhur, and all who live in your house will go into captivity; and you will enter Babylon, and there you will die and there you will be buried, you and all your friends to whom you have falsely prophesied.'" ## Jeremiah's Complaint 







###### 7 



LORD, You persuaded me and I let myself be persuaded; You have overcome me and prevailed. I have become a laughingstock all day long; Everyone mocks me. 







###### 8 



For each time I speak, I cry aloud; I proclaim violence and destruction, Because for me the word of the LORD has [^b]resulted In taunting and derision all day long. 







###### 9 



But _if_ I say, "I will not remember Him Nor speak anymore in His name," Then in my heart it becomes like a burning fire Shut up in my bones; And I am tired of holding _it_ in, And I cannot endure _it_. 







###### 10 



For I have heard the whispering of many, "Terror on every side! Denounce _him_; let's denounce him!" [^c]All my trusted friends, Watching for my fall, say: "Perhaps he will be persuaded, so that we may prevail against him And take our revenge on him." 







###### 11 



But the LORD is with me like a powerful champion; Therefore my persecutors will stumble and not prevail. They will be put to great shame because they have [^d]failed, An everlasting disgrace that will not be forgotten. 







###### 12 



Yet, LORD of armies, who tests the righteous, Who sees the [^e]mind and the heart; Let me see Your vengeance on them, For to You I have disclosed my cause. 







###### 13 



Sing to the LORD, praise the LORD! For He has saved the soul of the needy one From the hand of evildoers. 







###### 14 



Cursed be the day when I was born; May the day when my mother gave birth to me not be blessed! 







###### 15 



Cursed be the man who brought the news To my father, saying, "A [^f]boy has been born to you!" _And_ made him very happy. 







###### 16 



But may that man be like the cities Which the LORD overthrew without [^g]relenting, And may he hear an outcry in the morning And [^h]an alarm for war at noon; 







###### 17 



Because he did not kill me [^i]before birth, So that my mother would have been my grave, And her womb forever pregnant. 







###### 18 



Why did I ever come out of the womb To look at trouble and sorrow, So that my days have been spent in shame? ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

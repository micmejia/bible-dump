***








###### 1 



The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD when King Zedekiah sent to him Pashhur the son of Malchijah and Zephaniah the priest, the son of Maaseiah, saying, 







###### 2 



"Please inquire of the LORD in our behalf, because Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon is making war against us; perhaps the LORD will deal with us in accordance with all His [^a]wonderful acts, so that _the enemy_ will withdraw from us." 







###### 3 



But Jeremiah said to them, "You shall say to Zedekiah as follows: 







###### 4 



'This is what the LORD, the God of Israel says: "Behold, I am going to turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, with which you are making war against the king of Babylon and the Chaldeans who are besieging you outside the wall; and I will gather them into the middle of this city. 







###### 5 



And I Myself will make war against you with an outstretched hand and a mighty arm, and in anger, wrath, and great indignation. 







###### 6 



I will also strike the inhabitants of this city, both the people and the animals; they will die of a great plague. 







###### 7

###### 10

###### 11 



"Then _say_ to the household of the king of Judah, 'Hear the word of the LORD,

house of David, this is what the LORD says: "Administer justice [^b]every morning; And save the _person_ who has been robbed from the [^c]power of _his_ oppressor, So that My wrath will not spread like fire And burn, with no one to extinguish _it_, Because of the evil of their deeds. 







###### 13 



"Behold, I am against you, you inhabitant of the valley, You [^d]rocky plain," declares the LORD, "You who say, 'Who will come down against us? Or who will enter our dwellings?' 







###### 14 



But I will punish you according to the [^e]results of your deeds," declares the LORD, "And I will kindle a fire in its forest So that it may devour all its surroundings."'" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

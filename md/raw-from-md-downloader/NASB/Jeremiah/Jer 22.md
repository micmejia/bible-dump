# Jeremiah 22

***








###### 1 



This is what the LORD says: "Go down to the house of the king of Judah and there speak this word, 







###### 2 



and say, 'Hear the word of the LORD, O king of Judah, who sits on David's throne, you and your servants and your people who enter these gates. 







###### 3 



This is what the LORD says: "Do justice and righteousness, and save one who has been robbed from the power of _his_ oppressor. And do not mistreat _or_ do violence to the stranger, the orphan, or the widow; and do not shed innocent blood in this place. 







###### 4 



For if you will indeed perform this [^a]instruction, then kings will enter the gates of this house, sitting [^b]in David's place on his throne, riding in chariots and on horses, _the king_ himself, his servants, and his people. 







###### 5 



But if you will not obey these words, I swear by Myself," declares the LORD, "that this house will become a place of ruins."'" 







###### 6 



For this is what the LORD says concerning the house of the king of Judah: "You are _like_ Gilead to Me, _Like_ the summit of Lebanon; Yet most assuredly I will make you a wilderness, Cities that are not inhabited. 







###### 7 



For I will set apart destroyers against you, Each with his weapons; And they will cut down your choicest cedars And throw _them_ on the fire. 







###### 8 



"Many nations will pass by this city; and they will say to one another, 'Why has the LORD done this to this great city?' 







###### 9 



Then they will [^c]answer, 'Because they abandoned the covenant of the LORD their God and bowed down to other gods and served them.'" 







###### 10 



Do not weep for the dead or mourn for him, _But_ weep deeply for the one who goes away; For he will never return Or see his native land. 







###### 11 



For this is what the LORD says regarding [^d]Shallum the son of Josiah, king of Judah, who became king in the place of his father Josiah, who went out from this place: "He will never return there; 







###### 12 



but in the place where they took him into exile, there he will die and he will not see this land again. ## Messages about the Kings 







###### 13 



"Woe to him who builds his house without righteousness, And his upstairs rooms without justice, Who uses his neighbor's services without pay And does not give him his wages, 







###### 14 



Who says, 'I will build myself a large house With spacious upstairs rooms, And cut out its windows, [^e]Paneling _it_ with cedar and painting _it_ [^f]bright red.' 







###### 15 



Do you become a king because you are competing in cedar? Did your father not eat and drink And do justice and righteousness? Then it was well for him. 







###### 16 



He pled the cause of the afflicted and the poor, Then it was well. Is that not _what it means_ to know Me?" Declares the LORD. 







###### 17 



"But your eyes and your heart Are _intent_ only upon your own dishonest gain, And on shedding innocent blood, And on practicing oppression and extortion." 







###### 18 



Therefore this is what the LORD says regarding Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah: "They will not mourn for him: 'Oh, my brother!' or, 'Oh, sister!' They will not mourn for him: 'Oh, for the master!' or, 'Oh, for his splendor!' 







###### 19 



He will be buried with a donkey's burial, Dragged off and thrown out beyond the gates of Jerusalem. 







###### 20 



Go up to Lebanon and cry out, And raise your voice in Bashan; Cry out also from Abarim, For all your lovers have been crushed. 







###### 21 



I spoke to you in your prosperity; But you said, 'I will not listen!' This has been your way from your youth, That you have not obeyed My voice. 







###### 22 



The wind will sweep away all your shepherds, And your lovers will go into captivity; Then you will certainly be ashamed and humiliated Because of all your wickedness. 







###### 23 



You who live in Lebanon, Nested in the cedars, How you will groan when sharp pains come on you, Pain like a woman in childbirth! 







###### 24 



"As I live," declares the LORD, "even if [^g]Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were a signet _ring_ on My right hand, yet I would pull [^h]you [^i]off; 







###### 25 



and I will hand you over to those who are seeking your life, yes, to those of whom you are frightened, that is, to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and the Chaldeans. 







###### 26 



I will hurl you and your mother who gave birth to you into another country where you were not born, and there you will die. 







###### 27 



But as for the land to which they long to return, they will not return to it. 







###### 28 



Is this man Coniah a despised, shattered jar? Or is he an undesirable vessel? Why have he and his descendants been hurled out And cast into a land that they had not known? 







###### 29 



O land, land, land, Hear the word of the LORD! 







###### 30 



This is what the LORD says: 'Write this man down _as_ childless, A man who will not prosper in his days; For no man among his descendants will prosper Sitting on the throne of David Or ruling again in Judah.'" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

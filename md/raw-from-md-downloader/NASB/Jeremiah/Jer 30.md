# Jeremiah 30

***








###### 1 



The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, 







###### 2 



"This is what the LORD, the God of Israel says: 'Write all the words which I have spoken to you in a book. 







###### 3 



For behold, days are coming,' declares the LORD, 'when I will restore the fortunes of My people Israel and Judah.' The LORD says, 'I will also bring them back to the land that I gave to their forefathers, and they shall take possession of it.'" 







###### 4 



Now these are the words which the LORD spoke concerning Israel and Judah: 







###### 5 



"For this is what the LORD says: '[^a]I have heard a sound of terror, Of fear, and there is no peace. 







###### 6 



Ask now, and see If a male can give birth. Why do I see every man _With_ his hands on his waist, as a woman in childbirth? And _why_ have all faces turned pale? 







###### 7 



Woe, for that day is great, There is none like it; And it is the time of Jacob's distress, Yet he will be saved from it. 







###### 8 



'It shall come about on that day,' declares the LORD of armies, 'that I will break his yoke from [^b]their necks and will tear to pieces [^c]their restraints; and strangers will no longer make [^d]them their slaves. 







###### 9 



But they shall serve the LORD their God and David their king, whom I will raise up for them. 







###### 10 



And do not fear, Jacob My servant,' declares the LORD, 'And do not be dismayed, Israel; For behold, I am going to save you from far away, And your [^e]descendants from the land of their captivity. And Jacob will return and be at peace, without anxiety, And no one will make him afraid. 







###### 11 



For I am with you,' declares the LORD, 'to save you; For I will completely destroy all the nations where I have scattered you, Only I will not destroy you completely. But I will discipline you fairly And will by no means leave you unpunished.' 







###### 12 



"For this is what the LORD says: 'Your broken _limb_ is irreparable, And your wound is incurable. 







###### 13 



There is no one to plead your cause; _No_ healing for _your_ sore, No recovery for you. 







###### 14 



All your lovers have forgotten you, They do not seek you; For I have wounded you with the wound of an enemy, With the punishment of a cruel one, Because your wrongdoing is great, _And_ your sins are numerous. 







###### 15 



Why do you cry out over your injury? Your pain is incurable. Because your wrongdoing is great _And_ your sins are numerous, I have done these things to you. 







###### 16 



Therefore all who devour you will be devoured; And all your adversaries, every one of them, will go into captivity; And those who plunder you will become plunder, And all who plunder you I will turn into plunder. 







###### 17 



For I will [^f]restore you to [^g]health And I will heal you of your wounds,' declares the LORD, 'Because they have called you an outcast, saying: "It is Zion; no one [^h]cares for her."' ## Restoration of Jacob 







###### 18 



"This is what the LORD says: 'Behold, I will restore the fortunes of the tents of Jacob And have compassion on his dwellings; And the city will be rebuilt on its ruins, And the palace will stand on its rightful place. 







###### 19 



From them will come a song of thanksgiving And the voices of those who [^i]celebrate; And I will multiply them and they will not decrease; I will honor them and they will not be insignificant. 







###### 20 



[^j]Their children also will be as before, And [^k]their congregation will be established before Me; And I will punish all [^l]their oppressors. 







###### 21 



[^m]Their leader shall be one of them, And [^n]their ruler will come out from [^o]their midst; And I will bring him near and he shall approach Me; For [^p]who would dare to risk his life to approach Me?' declares the LORD. 







###### 22 



'You shall be My people, And I will be your God.'" 







###### 23 



Behold, the tempest of the LORD! Wrath has gone forth, A [^q]sweeping tempest; It will whirl upon the head of the wicked. 







###### 24 



The fierce anger of the LORD will not turn back Until He has performed and accomplished The intent of His heart.

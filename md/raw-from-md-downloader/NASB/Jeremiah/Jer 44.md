# Jeremiah 44

***








###### 1 



The word that came to Jeremiah for all the Jews living in the land of Egypt, those who were living in Migdol, Tahpanhes, Memphis, and the land of Pathros, saying, 







###### 2 



"This is what the LORD of armies, the God of Israel says: 'You yourselves have seen all the disaster that I have brought on Jerusalem and all the cities of Judah; and behold, this day they are in ruins and no one lives in them, 







###### 3 



because of their wickedness which they committed to provoke Me to anger by continuing to burn [^a]sacrifices _and_ to serve other gods whom they had not known, _neither_ they, you, nor your fathers. 







###### 4 



Yet I sent you all My servants the prophets again and again, saying, "Oh, do not do this abominable thing which I hate." 







###### 5 



But they did not listen or incline their ears to turn from their wickedness, so as not to burn [^b]sacrifices to other gods. 







###### 6 



Therefore My wrath and My anger gushed out and burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, so they have become ruins and a desolation as _it is_ this day. 







###### 7 



Now then, this is what the LORD God of armies, the God of Israel says: "Why are you doing great harm to yourselves, to eliminate from yourselves man and woman, child and infant from among Judah, leaving yourselves without a remnant, 







###### 8 



provoking Me to anger with the works of your hands, burning [^c]sacrifices to other gods in the land of Egypt where you are entering to reside, so that you may be eliminated and become a curse and a disgrace among all the nations of the earth? 







###### 9 



Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, the wickedness of the kings of Judah and the wickedness of their wives, your own wickedness and the wickedness of your wives, which they committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? 







###### 10 



_Yet_ they have not become [^d]contrite _even_ to this day, nor have they feared, nor walked in My Law or My statutes, which I placed before you and before your fathers."' 







###### 11 



"Therefore this is what the LORD of armies, the God of Israel says: 'Behold, I am going to set My face against you for a disaster, even to eliminate all Judah. 







###### 12 



And I will take away the remnant of Judah who have set their [^e]minds on entering the land of Egypt to reside there, and they will all [^f]meet their end in the land of Egypt; they will fall by the sword _or_ meet their end by famine. From the small to the great, they will die by the sword and famine; and they will become a curse, an object of horror, [^g]an imprecation, and a disgrace. 







###### 13 



And I will punish those who live in the land of Egypt, just as I have punished Jerusalem, with the sword, with famine, and with plague. 







###### 14 



So there will be no survivor or refugee for the remnant of Judah who have entered the land of Egypt to reside there and _then_ to return to the land of Judah, to which they are [^h]longing to return to live; for none will return except _a few_ refugees.'" 







###### 15 



Then all the men who were aware that their wives were burning [^i]sacrifices to other gods, along with all the women who were standing by, _as_ a large assembly, [^j]including all the people who were living in Pathros in the land of Egypt, responded to Jeremiah, saying, 







###### 16 



"As for the [^k]message that you have spoken to us in the name of the LORD, we are not going to listen to you! 







###### 17 



But we will certainly carry out every word that has proceeded from our mouths, [^l]by burning [^m]sacrifices to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, just as we ourselves, our forefathers, our kings, and our leaders did in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; for _then_ we had plenty of [^n]food and were well off and saw no [^o]misfortune. 







###### 18 



But since we stopped burning [^p]sacrifices to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have lacked everything, and have met our end by the sword and by famine." 







###### 19 



"And," _said the women_, "when we were burning [^q]sacrifices to the queen of heaven and [^r]pouring out drink offerings to her, was it without our husbands that we made for her sacrificial cakes [^s]in her image, and poured out drink offerings to her?" ## Disaster for the Jews 







###### 20 



Then Jeremiah said to all the people, to the men and women--even to all the people who were giving him _such_ an answer--saying, 







###### 21 



"As for the [^t]smoking sacrifices that you burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, you and your forefathers, your kings and your leaders, and the people of the land, did the LORD not remember them, and did _all of this_ not come into His [^u]mind? 







###### 22 



So the LORD was no longer able to endure _it_, because of the evil of your deeds, because of the abominations which you have committed; so your land has become a place of ruins, an object of horror, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as _it is_ this day. 







###### 23 



Since you have burned [^v]sacrifices and have sinned against the LORD and not obeyed the voice of the LORD nor walked in His Law, His statutes, or His testimonies, therefore this disaster has happened to you, as _it has_ this day." 







###### 24 



Then Jeremiah said to all the people, including all the women, "Hear the word of the LORD, all Judah who are in the land of Egypt! 







###### 25 



This is what the LORD of armies, the God of Israel [^w]says: 'As for you and your wives, you have spoken with your mouths and fulfilled _it_ with your hands, saying, "We will certainly perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn [^x]sacrifices to the queen of heaven and pour out drink offerings to her." By all means fulfill your vows, and be sure to perform your vows!' 







###### 26 



[^y]In return, hear the word of the LORD, all Judah who are living in the land of Egypt: 'Behold, I have sworn by My great name,' says the LORD, 'that My name shall never be invoked again by the mouth of anyone of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, "As the Lord [^z]God lives." 







###### 27 



Behold, I am watching over them for harm and not for good, and all the people of Judah who are in the land of Egypt will [^aa]meet their end by the sword or by famine until they [^ab]are completely gone. 







###### 28 



Those who escape the sword will return from the land of Egypt to the land of Judah [^ac]few in number. Then all the remnant of Judah who have gone to the land of Egypt to reside there will know whose word will stand, Mine or theirs. 







###### 29 



And this will be the sign to you,' declares the LORD, 'that I am going to punish you in this place, so that you may know that My words will assuredly stand against you for harm.' 







###### 30 



This is what the LORD says: 'Behold, I am going to hand Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt over to his enemies, to those who seek his life, just as I handed Zedekiah king of Judah over to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, _who was_ his enemy and was seeking his life.'" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

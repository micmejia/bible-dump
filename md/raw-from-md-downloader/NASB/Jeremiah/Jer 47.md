# Jeremiah 47

***








###### 1 



The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines, before Pharaoh [^a]conquered Gaza. 







###### 2 



This is what the LORD says: "Behold, waters are going to rise from the north And become an overflowing torrent, And overflow the land and everything that is in it, The city and those who live in it; And the people will cry out, And every inhabitant of the land will wail. 







###### 3 



Because of the noise of the [^b]galloping hoofs of his [^c]stallions, The roar of his chariots, _and_ the rumbling of his wheels, The fathers have not turned back for _their_ children, Because of the debility of _their_ hands, 







###### 4 



Because of the day that is coming To destroy all the Philistines, To eliminate from Tyre and Sidon Every surviving ally; For the LORD is going to destroy the Philistines, The remnant of the coastland of Caphtor. 







###### 5 



Baldness has come upon Gaza; Ashkelon has been destroyed. Remnant of their valley, How long will you gash yourself? 







###### 6 



Ah, sword of the LORD, How long will you not be quiet? Withdraw into your sheath; Rest and stay still. 







###### 7 



How can [^d]it be quiet, When the LORD has given it an order? Against Ashkelon and against the sea shore-- There He has summoned it." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

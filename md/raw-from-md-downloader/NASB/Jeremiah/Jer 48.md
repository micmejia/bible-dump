# Jeremiah 48

***








###### 1 



Concerning Moab. This is what the LORD of armies, the God of Israel says: "Woe to Nebo, for it has been destroyed; Kiriathaim has been put to shame, it has been captured; The high stronghold has been put to shame and [^a]shattered. 







###### 2 



There is no longer praise for Moab; In Heshbon they have devised disaster against her: 'Come and let's cut her off from _being_ a nation!' You too, [^b]Madmen, will be silenced; The sword will follow you. 







###### 3 



The sound of an outcry from Horonaim, 'Devastation and great destruction!' 







###### 4 



Moab is broken, Her little ones have sounded out a cry _of distress_. 







###### 5 



For they will go up by the ascent of Luhith With continual weeping; For at the descent of Horonaim They have heard the [^c]anguished cry of destruction. 







###### 6 



Flee, save yourselves, So that you may be like a juniper in the wilderness. 







###### 7 



For because of your trust in your own achievements and treasures, You yourself will also be captured; And Chemosh will go off into exile Together with his priests and his leaders. 







###### 8 



A destroyer will come to every city, So that no city will escape; The valley also will be ruined And the plateau will be destroyed, As the LORD has said. 







###### 9 



Give [^d]wings to Moab, For she will [^e]flee away; And her cities will become a desolation, Without inhabitants in them. 







###### 10 



Cursed is the one who does the LORD's work negligently, And cursed is the one who restrains his sword from blood. 







###### 11 



"Moab has been at ease since his youth; He has also been peaceful, _like wine_ on [^f]its dregs, And he has not been poured from vessel to vessel, Nor has he gone into exile. Therefore [^g]he retains his flavor, And his aroma has not changed. 







###### 12 



Therefore behold, the days are coming," declares the LORD, "when I will send to him those who tip _vessels_, and they will tip him over, and they will pour out his vessels and smash [^h]his jars. 







###### 13 



And Moab will be ashamed of Chemosh, just as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel, their confidence. 







###### 14 



How can you say, 'We are warriors, And men competent for battle'? 







###### 15 



Moab has been destroyed and [^i]men have gone up to [^j]his cities; His choicest [^k]young men have also gone down to the slaughter," Declares the King, whose name is the LORD of armies. 







###### 16 



"The disaster of Moab will soon come, And his catastrophe has hurried quickly. 







###### 17 



Mourn for him, all you who _live_ around him, And all of you who know his name; Say, 'How the mighty [^l]scepter has been broken, A staff of splendor!' 







###### 18 



Come down from your glory And sit on the parched ground, O daughter living in Dibon, For the destroyer of Moab has come up against you, He has ruined your strongholds. 







###### 19 



Stand by the road and keep watch, You inhabitant of Aroer; Ask him who flees and her who escapes _And_ say, 'What has happened?' 







###### 20 



Moab has been put to shame, for it has been [^m]shattered. Wail and cry out; Declare by the Arnon That Moab has been destroyed. 







###### 21 



"Judgment has also come upon the plain, upon Holon, Jahzah, and against Mephaath, 







###### 22 



against Dibon, Nebo, and Beth-diblathaim, 







###### 23 



against Kiriathaim, Beth-gamul, and Beth-meon, 







###### 24 



against Kerioth, Bozrah, and all the cities of the land of Moab, far and near. 







###### 25 



The horn of Moab has been cut off, and his arm broken," declares the LORD. 







###### 26 



"Make him drunk, for he has [^n]become arrogant toward the LORD; so Moab will [^o]vomit, and he also will become a laughingstock. 







###### 27 



Now was Israel not a laughingstock to you? Or was he [^p]caught among thieves? For whenever you speak about him you shake _your head in scorn_. 







###### 28 



Leave the cities and live among the rocky cliffs, You inhabitants of Moab, And be like a dove that nests Beyond the mouth of the chasm. 







###### 29 



We have heard of the pride of Moab--he _is_ very proud-- Of his haughtiness, his pride, his arrogance, and [^q]his self-exaltation. 







###### 30 



I know his fury," declares the LORD, "But it is futile; His idle boasts have accomplished nothing. 







###### 31 



Therefore I will wail for Moab, For all of Moab I will cry out; [^r]I will moan for the men of Kir-heres. 







###### 32 



More than the weeping for Jazer I will weep for you, O vine of Sibmah! Your tendrils stretched across the sea, They reached to the sea of Jazer; Upon your summer fruits and your grape harvest The destroyer has fallen. 







###### 33 



So joy and rejoicing are removed From the fruitful field, and from the land of Moab. And I have eliminated the wine from the wine presses; No one will tread _them_ with shouting, The shouting will not be shouts _of joy_. 







###### 34 



From the outcry at Heshbon to Elealeh, to Jahaz they have [^s]raised their voice, from Zoar to Horonaim, _and to_ Eglath-shelishiyah; for even the waters of Nimrim will become desolate. 







###### 35 



And I will put an end to Moab," declares the LORD, "the one who offers _sacrifice_ on the high place and the one who [^t]burns incense to his gods. 







###### 36 



"Therefore My heart makes a sound like flutes for Moab; My heart also makes a sound like flutes for the men of Kir-heres. Therefore they have lost the abundance it produced. 







###### 37 



For every head is _shaved_ bald, and every beard cut short; there are gashes on all the hands, and sackcloth around the waists. 







###### 38 



On all the housetops of Moab and in its public squares [^u]there is mourning everywhere; for I have broken Moab like an undesirable vessel," declares the LORD. 







###### 39 



"How [^v]shattered it is! _How_ they have wailed! How Moab has turned his back--he is ashamed! So Moab will become a laughingstock and an object of terror to all around him." 







###### 40 



For this is what the LORD says: "Behold, one will fly swiftly like an eagle And spread out his wings against Moab. 







###### 41 



Kerioth has been captured And the strongholds have been seized, So the hearts of the warriors of Moab on that day Will be like the heart of a woman in labor. 







###### 42 



Moab will be destroyed from _being_ a people Because he has [^w]become arrogant toward the LORD. 







###### 43 



Terror, pit, and snare are _coming_ upon you, Inhabitant of Moab," declares the LORD. 







###### 44 



"The one who flees from the terror Will fall into the pit, And the one who climbs up out of the pit Will be caught in the snare; For I will bring upon her, upon Moab, The year of their punishment," declares the LORD. 







###### 45 



"In the shadow of Heshbon The fugitives stand without strength; For a fire has spread out from Heshbon And a flame from the midst of Sihon, And it has devoured the forehead of Moab And the scalps of the [^x]loud revelers. 







###### 46 



Woe to you, Moab! The people of Chemosh have perished; For your sons have been taken away captive, And your daughters into captivity. 







###### 47 



Yet I will restore the fortunes of Moab In the [^y]latter days," declares the LORD. This is the extent of the judgment on Moab. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

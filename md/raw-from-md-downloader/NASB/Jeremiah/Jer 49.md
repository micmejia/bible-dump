# Jeremiah 49

***








###### 1 



Concerning the sons of Ammon. This is what the LORD says: "Does Israel have no sons? Or has he no heirs? Why _then_ has [^a]Malcam taken possession of Gad, And his people settled in its cities? 







###### 2 



Therefore behold, the days are coming," declares the LORD, "When I will cause an alarm of war to be heard Against Rabbah of the sons of Ammon; And it will become a desolate heap, And her towns will be set on fire. Then Israel will take possession of his possessors," Says the LORD. 







###### 3 



"Wail, Heshbon, for Ai has been destroyed! Cry out, daughters of Rabbah, Put on sackcloth and mourn, And move about inside the walls; For [^b]Malcam will go into exile Together with his priests and his leaders. 







###### 4 



How you boast about the valleys! Your valley is flowing _away_, You backsliding daughter Who trusts in her treasures, _saying_, 'Who can come against me?' 







###### 5 



Behold, I am going to bring terror upon you," Declares the Lord [^c]God of armies, "From all _directions_ around you; And you will be driven away [^d]one after another, With no one to gather the fugitives together. 







###### 6 



But afterward I will restore The fortunes of the sons of Ammon," Declares the LORD. ## Prophecy against Edom 







###### 7 



Concerning Edom. This is what the LORD of armies says: "Is there no longer _any_ wisdom in Teman? Has _good_ advice been lost by the prudent? Has their wisdom decayed? 







###### 8 



Flee away, turn back, dwell in the depths, You inhabitants of Dedan, For I [^e]will bring the disaster of Esau upon him At the time I [^f]punish him. 







###### 9 



If grape pickers came to you, Would they not leave gleanings? If thieves _came_ by night, They would destroy _only_ what was sufficient for them. 







###### 10 



But I have stripped Esau bare, I have uncovered his hiding places So that he will not be able to conceal himself; His [^g]offspring have been destroyed along with his [^h]brothers And his neighbors, and he no _longer_ exists. 







###### 11 



Leave your [^i]orphans behind, I will keep _them_ alive; And let your widows trust in Me." 







###### 12 



For this is what the LORD says: "Behold, those [^j]who were not sentenced to drink the cup will certainly drink _it_, so are you the one who will be held completely blameless? You will not be held blameless, but you will certainly drink _it_. 







###### 13 



For I have sworn by Myself," declares the LORD, "that Bozrah will become an object of horror, a disgrace, a wasteland, and a curse; and all its cities will become permanent ruins." 







###### 14 



I have heard a message from the LORD, And a messenger is being sent among the nations, _saying_, "Gather yourselves together and come against her, And rise up for battle!" 







###### 15 



"For behold, I have made you small among the nations, Despised among people. 







###### 16 



As for the terror you cause, The arrogance of your heart has deceived you, You who live in the clefts of [^k]the rock, Who occupy the height of the hill. Though you make your nest as high as an eagle's, I will bring you down from there," declares the LORD. 







###### 17 



"Edom will become an object of horror; everyone who passes by it will be appalled and will [^l]hiss at all its wounds. 







###### 18 



Like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah with its neighbors," says the LORD, "no one will live there, nor will [^m]anyone of mankind reside in it. 







###### 19 



Behold, one will come up like a lion from the thicket of the Jordan to a perennially watered pasture; for in an instant I will chase him away from it, and I will appoint over it whoever is chosen. For who is like Me, and who will summon Me _into court_? And who then is the shepherd who can stand against Me?" 







###### 20 



Therefore hear the plan of the LORD which He has planned against Edom, and His purposes which He has in mind against the inhabitants of Teman: they will certainly drag them off, _even_ the little ones of the flock; He will certainly make their pasture desolate because of them. 







###### 21 



The earth has quaked at the noise of their downfall. There is an outcry! The noise of it has been heard at the [^n]Red Sea. 







###### 22 



Behold, [^o]He will mount up and swoop like an eagle, and spread out His wings [^p]against Bozrah; and the hearts of the warriors of Edom on that day will be like the heart of a woman in labor. ## Prophecy against Damascus 







###### 23 



Concerning Damascus: "Hamath and Arpad are put to shame, For they have heard bad news; They despair. There is anxiety at the sea, It cannot be calmed. 







###### 24 



Damascus has become helpless; She has turned away to flee, And panic has gripped her; Distress and labor pains have seized her Like a woman in childbirth. 







###### 25 



How the city of praise has not been deserted, The town of My joy! 







###### 26 



Therefore, her young men will fall in her streets, And all the men of war will perish on that day," declares the LORD of armies. 







###### 27 



"I will set fire to the wall of Damascus, And it will devour the fortified palace of Ben-hadad." ## Prophecy against Kedar and Hazor 







###### 28 



Concerning Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon defeated. This is what the LORD says: "Arise, go up to Kedar And devastate the [^q]people of the east. 







###### 29 



They will take away their tents and their flocks; They will carry off for themselves Their tent curtains, all their goods and their camels, And they will call out to one another, 'Horror on every side!' 







###### 30 



Run away, flee! Dwell in the depths, You inhabitants of Hazor," declares the LORD; "For Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has formed a plan against you And devised a scheme against you. 







###### 31 



Arise, go up against a nation which is at ease, Which lives securely," declares the LORD. "It has no gates or bars; They dwell alone. 







###### 32 



Their camels will become plunder, And their many livestock for spoils, And I will scatter to all the winds those who cut the corners _of their hair_; And I will bring their disaster from every side," declares the LORD. 







###### 33 



"Hazor will become a haunt of jackals, A desolation forever; No one will live there, Nor will [^r]anyone of mankind reside in it." ## Prophecy against Elam 







###### 34 



The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam, at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying: 







###### 35 



"This is what the LORD of armies says: 'Behold, I am going to break the bow of Elam, The [^s]finest of their might. 







###### 36 



I will bring upon Elam the four winds From the four ends of heaven, And will scatter them to all these winds; And there will be no nation To which the outcasts of Elam will not go. 







###### 37 



So I will [^t]shatter Elam before their enemies And before those who seek their lives; And I will bring disaster upon them, Even My fierce anger,' declares the LORD, 'And I will send the sword after them Until I have consumed them. 







###### 38 



Then I will set My throne in Elam, And eliminate from there _the_ king and officials,' Declares the LORD. 







###### 39 



'But it will come about in the last days That I will restore the fortunes of Elam,'" Declares the LORD. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Jeremiah 50

***








###### 1 



The word which the LORD spoke concerning Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans, through Jeremiah the prophet: 







###### 2 



"Declare and proclaim among the nations. Proclaim it and lift up a flag, Do not conceal _it_. Say, 'Babylon has been captured, Bel has been put to shame, [^a]Marduk has been [^b]shattered; Her idols have been put to shame, her images have been shattered.' 







###### 3 



For a nation has come up against her from the north; it will make her land an object of horror, and there will be no inhabitant in it. Whether people or animals, they have wandered off, they have gone! 







###### 4 



"In those days and at that time," declares the LORD, "the sons of Israel will come, they and the sons of Judah as well; they will go along weeping as they go, and _it will be_ the LORD their God _whom_ they will seek. 







###### 5 



They will ask for the way to Zion, _turning_ their faces [^c]in its direction; [^d]they [^e]will come so that they may join themselves to the LORD _in_ an everlasting covenant _that_ will not be forgotten. 







###### 6 



"My people have become lost sheep; Their shepherds have led them astray. They have made them turn aside _on_ the mountains. They have gone from mountain to hill, They have forgotten their resting place. 







###### 7 



All who found them have devoured them; And their adversaries have said, 'We are not guilty, Since they have sinned against the LORD _who is_ the habitation of righteousness, The LORD, the hope of their fathers.' 







###### 8 



"Wander away from the midst of Babylon And [^f]go out from the land of the Chaldeans; Be like male goats [^g]at the head of the flock. 







###### 9 



For behold, I am going to rouse and bring up against Babylon A contingent of great nations from the land of the north, And they will draw up _their_ battle lines against her; From there she will be taken captive. Their arrows will be like [^h]an expert warrior Who does not return empty-handed. 







###### 10 



[^i]Chaldea will become plunder; All who plunder her will have enough," declares the LORD. 







###### 11 



"Because you are glad, because you are jubilant, You who pillage My heritage, Because you skip about [^j]like a threshing heifer And neigh like [^k]stallions, 







###### 12 



Your mother [^l]will be greatly ashamed, She who gave you birth [^m]will be humiliated. Behold, _she will be_ the least of the nations, A wilderness, a dry land and a desert. 







###### 13 



Because of the wrath of the LORD she will not be inhabited, But she will be completely desolate; Everyone who passes by Babylon will be horrified And will hiss because of all her wounds. 







###### 14 



Draw up your battle lines against Babylon on every side, All of you who [^n]bend the bow; Shoot at her, do not spare _your_ arrows, For she has sinned against the LORD. 







###### 15 



Raise your battle cry against her on every side! She has given [^o]herself up, her towers have fallen, Her walls have been torn down. For this is the vengeance of the LORD: Take vengeance on her; As she has done _to others, so_ do to her. 







###### 16 



Eliminate the sower from Babylon And the one who wields the sickle at the time of harvest; From [^p]the sword of the oppressor Each of them will turn back to his own people And each of them will flee to his own land. 







###### 17 



"Israel is a scattered [^q]flock, the lions have driven _them_ away. The first one _who_ devoured him was the king of Assyria, and this last one _who_ has gnawed his bones is Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. 







###### 18 



Therefore this is what the LORD of armies, the God of Israel says: 'Behold, I am going to punish the king of Babylon and his land, just as I punished the king of Assyria. 







###### 19 



And I will bring Israel back to his pasture and he will graze on Carmel and Bashan, and his [^r]desire will be satisfied in the hill country of Ephraim and Gilead. 







###### 20 



In those days and at that time,' declares the LORD, 'search will be made for the wrongdoing of Israel, but there will be none; and for the sins of Judah, but they will not be found; for I will forgive those whom I leave as a remnant.' 







###### 21 



"Against the land of [^s]Merathaim, go up against it, And against the inhabitants of [^t]Pekod. Kill and [^u]completely destroy them," declares the LORD, "And do according to everything that I have commanded you. 







###### 22 



The noise of battle is in the land, And great destruction. 







###### 23 



How the hammer of the whole earth Has been cut off and broken! How Babylon has become An object of horror among the nations! 







###### 24 



I set a trap for you and you were also caught, Babylon, While you yourself were not aware; You have been found and also seized Because you have engaged in conflict with the LORD." 







###### 25 



The LORD has opened His armory And has brought out the weapons of His indignation, For it is a work of the Lord [^v]God of armies In the land of the Chaldeans. 







###### 26 



Come to her from the [^w]farthest border; Open up her barns, Pile her up like heaps of grain And [^x]completely destroy her, Let nothing be left to her. 







###### 27 



Put all her bulls to the sword; Let them go down to the slaughter! Woe be upon them, for their day has come, The time of their punishment. 







###### 28 



There is a sound of fugitives and refugees from the land of Babylon, To declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, Vengeance for His temple. 







###### 29 



"Summon [^y]many against Babylon, All those who [^z]bend the bow: Encamp against her on every side, Let there be no escape[^aa]. Repay her according to her work; According to all that she has done, _so_ do to her; For she has become arrogant against the LORD, Against the Holy One of Israel. 







###### 30 



Therefore her young men will fall in her streets, And all her men of war will perish on that day," declares the LORD. 







###### 31 



"Behold, I am against you, [^ab]arrogant one," Declares the Lord [^ac]God of armies, "For your day has come, The time [^ad]when I will punish you. 







###### 32 



The [^ae]arrogant one will stumble and fall With no one to raise him up; And I will set fire to his cities, And it will devour all his surroundings." 







###### 33 



This is what the LORD of armies says: "The sons of Israel are oppressed, And the sons of Judah as well; And all who took them captive have held them firmly, They have refused to let them go. 







###### 34 



Their Redeemer is strong, the LORD of armies is His name; He will vigorously plead their case So that He may bring rest to their land, But turmoil to the inhabitants of Babylon. 







###### 35 



A sword against the Chaldeans," declares the LORD, "And against the inhabitants of Babylon And against her leaders and her wise men! 







###### 36 



A sword against the oracle priests, and they will become fools! A sword against her warriors, and they will be [^af]shattered! 







###### 37 



A sword against [^ag]their horses, against [^ah]their chariots, And against all the [^ai]foreigners who are in the midst of her, And they will become women! A sword against her treasures, and they will be plundered! 







###### 38 



A [^aj]drought on her waters, and they will be dried up! For it is a land of idols, And they go insane at frightful images. 







###### 39 



"Therefore the desert creatures will live _there_ with the jackals; The ostriches also will live in it. It will never again be inhabited Nor lived in from generation to generation. 







###### 40 



As when God overthrew Sodom And Gomorrah with its neighbors," declares the LORD, "No one will live there, Nor will [^ak]anyone of mankind reside in it. 







###### 41 



"Behold, a people is coming from the north, And a great nation and many kings Will be roused from the remote parts of the earth. 







###### 42 



They seize _their_ bow and javelin; They are cruel and have no mercy. Their voice roars like the sea; And they ride on horses, Drawn up like a man for the battle Against you, daughter of Babylon. 







###### 43 



The king of Babylon has heard the report about them, And his hands hang limp; Distress has gripped him, Agony like a woman in childbirth. 







###### 44 



"Behold, one will come up like a lion from the thicket of the Jordan to a perennially watered pasture; for in an instant I will chase them away from it, and I will appoint over it whoever is chosen. For who is like Me, and who will summon Me _into court_? And who then is the shepherd who can stand against Me?" 







###### 45 



Therefore hear the plan of the LORD which He has planned against Babylon, and His purposes which He has in mind against the land of the Chaldeans: they will certainly drag them off, _even_ the little ones of the flock; He will certainly make their pasture desolate because of them. 







###### 46 



At the [^al]shout, "Babylon has been conquered!" the earth quakes, and an outcry is heard among the nations. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

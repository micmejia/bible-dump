# Job 1

***








###### 1 



There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and that man was blameless, upright, fearing God and turning away from evil. 







###### 2 



Seven sons and three daughters were born to him. 







###### 3 



His possessions were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and very many servants; and that man was the greatest of all the [^a]men of the east. 







###### 4 



His sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each one on his day, and they would send _word_ and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. 







###### 5 



When the days of feasting had completed their cycle, Job would send _word to them_ and consecrate them, getting up early in the morning and offering burnt offerings _according to_ the number of them all; for Job said, "Perhaps my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts." Job did so continually. 







###### 6 



Now there was a day when the [^b]sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and [^c]Satan also came among them. 







###### 7 



The LORD said to Satan, "From where do you come?" Satan answered the LORD and said, "From roaming about on the earth and walking around on it." 







###### 8 



The LORD said to Satan, "Have you [^d]considered My servant Job? For there is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, [^e]fearing God and turning away from evil." 







###### 9 



Then Satan answered the [^f]LORD, "Does Job fear God for nothing? 







###### 10 



Have You not made a fence around him and his house and all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land. 







###### 11 



But reach out with Your hand now and touch all that he has; he will certainly curse You to Your face." 







###### 12 



Then the LORD said to Satan, "Behold, all that he has is in your [^g]power; only do not reach out _and put_ your hand on him." So Satan departed from the presence of the LORD. ## Satan Allowed to Test Job 







###### 13 



Now on the day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house, 







###### 14 



a messenger came to Job and said, "The oxen were plowing and the female donkeys feeding beside them, 







###### 15 



and [^h]the Sabeans [^i]attacked and took them. They also [^j]killed the servants with the edge of the sword, and [^k]I alone have escaped to tell you." 







###### 16 



While he was still speaking, another came and said, "The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you." 







###### 17 



While he was still speaking, another came and said, "The Chaldeans formed three units and made a raid on the camels and took them, and [^l]killed the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you." 







###### 18 



While he was still speaking, another also came and said, "Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house, 







###### 19 



and behold, a great wind came from across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young people and they died, and I alone have escaped to tell you." 







###### 20 



Then Job got up, tore his robe, and shaved his head; then he fell to the ground and worshiped. 







###### 21 



He said, "Naked I came from my mother's womb, And naked I shall return there. The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away. Blessed be the name of the LORD." 







###### 22 



Despite all this, Job did not sin, nor did he [^m]blame God. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

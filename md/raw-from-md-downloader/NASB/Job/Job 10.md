# Job 10

***








###### 1 



"[^a]I am disgusted with my own life; I will express my complaint freely; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul. 







###### 2 



I will say to God, 'Do not condemn me; Let me know why You contend with me. 







###### 3 



Is it [^b]right for You indeed to oppress, To reject the work of Your hands, And [^c]to look favorably on the plan of the wicked? 







###### 4 



Do You have eyes of flesh? Or do You see as mankind sees? 







###### 5 



Are Your days like the days of a mortal, Or Your years like a man's year, 







###### 6 



That You should search for my guilt And carefully seek my sin? 







###### 7 



According to Your knowledge I am indeed not guilty, Yet there is no one to save _me_ from Your hand. 







###### 8 



'Your hands fashioned and made me [^d]altogether, Yet would You destroy me? 







###### 9 



Remember that You have made me as clay; Yet would You turn me into dust again? 







###### 10 



Did You not pour me out like milk, And curdle me like cheese, 







###### 11 



Clothe me with skin and flesh, And intertwine me with bones and tendons? 







###### 12 



You have granted me life and [^e]goodness; And Your care has guarded my spirit. 







###### 13 



Yet You have concealed these things in Your heart; I know that this is within You: 







###### 14 



If I have sinned, You will take note of me, And will not acquit me of my guilt. 







###### 15 



If I am wicked, woe to me! But _if_ I am righteous, I _dare_ not lift up my head. _I am_ full of shame, and [^f]conscious of my misery. 







###### 16 



And should _my head_ be high, You would hunt me like a lion; And You would show Your power against me again. 







###### 17 



You renew Your witnesses against me And increase Your anger toward me; [^g]Hardship after hardship is with me. 







###### 18 



'Why then did You bring me out of the womb? If only I had died and no eye had seen me! 







###### 19 



I should have been as though I had not been, Brought from womb to tomb.' 







###### 20 



Would He not leave my few days alone? [^h]Withdraw from me so that I may have a little cheerfulness 







###### 21 



Before I go--and I shall not return-- To the land of darkness and deep shadow, 







###### 22 



The land of utter gloom like darkness _itself_, Of deep shadow without order, And it shines like darkness." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

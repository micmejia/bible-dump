# Job 11

***








###### 1 



Then Zophar the Naamathite responded, 







###### 2 



"Shall a multitude of words go unanswered, And a talkative man be acquitted? 







###### 3 



Shall your boasts silence people? And will you scoff, and no one rebuke? 







###### 4 



For you have said, 'My teaching is pure, And I am innocent in your eyes.' 







###### 5 



But if only God would speak, And open His lips against you, 







###### 6 



And show you the secrets of wisdom! For sound wisdom [^a]has two sides. Know then that God [^b]forgets part of your guilt. 







###### 7 



"Can you discover the depths of God? Can you discover the limits of the Almighty? 







###### 8 



_They are as_ high _as_ [^c]the heavens; what can you do? Deeper than [^d]Sheol; what can you know? 







###### 9 



Its measurement is longer than the earth And broader than the sea. 







###### 10 



If He passes by or apprehends _people_, Or calls an assembly, who can restrain Him? 







###### 11 



For He knows false people, And He sees injustice [^e]without investigating. 







###### 12 



[^f]An idiot will become intelligent When a wild donkey is born a human. 







###### 13 



"If you would direct your heart _rightly_ And spread out your hands to Him, 







###### 14 



If wrongdoing is in your hand, put it far away, And do not let malice dwell in your tents; 







###### 15 



Then, indeed, you could lift up your face without _moral_ blemish, And you would be firmly established and not fear. 







###### 16 



For you would forget _your_ trouble; Like waters that have passed by, you would remember _it_. 







###### 17 



Your [^g]life would [^h]be brighter than noonday; Darkness would be like the morning. 







###### 18 



Then you would trust, because there is hope; And you would look around and rest securely. 







###### 19 



You would lie down and none would disturb _you_, And many would [^i]flatter you. 







###### 20 



But the eyes of the wicked will fail, And [^j]there will be no escape for them; And their hope is [^k]to breathe their last." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

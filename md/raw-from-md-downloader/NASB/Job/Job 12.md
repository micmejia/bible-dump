# Job 12

***








###### 1 



Then Job responded, 







###### 2 



"Truly then you are the people, And with you wisdom will die! 







###### 3 



But I have intelligence as well as you; I am not inferior to you. And [^a]who does not know such things as these? 







###### 4 



I am a joke to [^b]my friends, The one who called on God and He answered him; The just _and_ blameless _man_ is a joke. 







###### 5 



[^c]He who is at ease holds disaster in contempt, As prepared for those whose feet slip. 







###### 6 



The tents of the destroyers prosper, And those who provoke God are secure, [^d]Whom God brings into their power. 







###### 7 



"But just ask the animals, and have them teach you; And the birds of the sky, and have them tell you. 







###### 8 



Or speak to the earth, and have it teach you; And have the fish of the sea tell you. 







###### 9 



Who among all these does not know That the hand of the LORD has done this, 







###### 10 



In whose hand is the life of every living thing, And the breath of all mankind? 







###### 11 



Does the ear not put words to the test, As the palate [^e]tastes its food? 







###### 12 



Wisdom is with the aged, _And with_ [^f]long life _comes_ understanding. ## Job Speaks of the Power of God 







###### 13 



"Wisdom and might are with Him; Advice and understanding _belong_ to Him. 







###### 14 



Behold, He tears down, and it cannot be rebuilt; He [^g]imprisons a person, and [^h]there is no release. 







###### 15 



Behold, He restrains the waters, and they dry up; And He sends them out, and they [^i]inundate the earth. 







###### 16 



Strength and sound wisdom are with Him. One who goes astray and one who leads astray belong to Him. 







###### 17 



He makes advisers walk [^j]barefoot And makes fools of judges. 







###### 18 



He undoes the binding of kings, And ties a loincloth around their waist. 







###### 19 



He makes priests walk [^k]barefoot, And overthrows the secure ones. 







###### 20 



He deprives the trusted ones of speech, And takes away the discernment of the elders. 







###### 21 



He pours contempt on nobles, And loosens the belt of the strong. 







###### 22 



He reveals mysteries from the darkness, And brings the deep darkness into light. 







###### 23 



He makes the nations great, then destroys them; He [^l]enlarges the nations, then leads them away. 







###### 24 



He deprives the leaders of the earth's people of [^m]intelligence And makes them wander in a pathless wasteland. 







###### 25 



They grope in darkness with no light, And He makes them stagger like a drunken person. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

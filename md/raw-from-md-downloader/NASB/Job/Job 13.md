# Job 13

***








###### 1 



"Behold, my eye has seen all _this_, My ear has heard and understood it. 







###### 2 



What you know I also know; I am not inferior to you. 







###### 3 



"But I would speak to [^a]the Almighty, And I desire to argue with God. 







###### 4 



But you smear _me_ with lies; You are all worthless physicians. 







###### 5 



Oh that you would be completely silent, And that it would become your wisdom! 







###### 6 



Please hear my argument, And give your attention to the contentions of my lips. 







###### 7 



Will you speak what is unjust for God, And speak what is deceitful for Him? 







###### 8 



Will you show partiality for Him? Will you contend for God? 







###### 9 



_Will it go_ well when He examines you? Or will you deceive Him as one deceives a man? 







###### 10 



He will certainly punish you If you secretly show partiality. 







###### 11 



Will His [^b]majesty not terrify you, And the dread of Him fall upon you? 







###### 12 



Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes, Your defenses are defenses of clay. ## Job Is Sure He Will Be Vindicated 







###### 13 



"Be silent before me so that I may speak; Then let come upon me what _may_. 







###### 14 



Why should I take my flesh in my teeth, And put my life in my [^c]hands? 







###### 15 



Though He slay me, I will [^d]hope in Him. Nevertheless I will argue my ways [^e]before Him. 







###### 16 



This also _will be_ my salvation, For a godless person cannot come before His presence. 







###### 17 



Listen carefully to my speech, And let my declaration _fill_ your ears. 







###### 18 



Behold now, I have prepared my case; I know that I will be vindicated. 







###### 19 



Who could contend with me? For then I would be silent and die. 







###### 20 



"Only two things _I ask that You_ do not do to me, Then I will not hide from Your face: 







###### 21 



Remove Your [^f]hand from me, And may the dread of You not terrify me. 







###### 22 



Then call and I will answer; Or let me speak, then reply to me. 







###### 23 



How many are my guilty deeds and sins? Make known to me my wrongdoing and my sin. 







###### 24 



Why do You hide Your face And consider me Your enemy? 







###### 25 



Will You scare away a scattered leaf? Or will You pursue the dry chaff? 







###### 26 



For You write bitter things against me And make me inherit the guilty deeds of my youth. 







###### 27 



You put my feet in the stocks And watch all my paths; You [^g]set a limit for the soles of my feet, 







###### 28 



While [^h]I am decaying like a rotten thing, Like a garment that is moth-eaten. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Job 14

***








###### 1 



"Man, who is born of woman, Is [^a]short-lived and full of turmoil. 







###### 2 



Like a flower he comes out and withers. He also flees like a shadow and does not remain. 







###### 3 



You also open Your eyes on him And bring [^b]him into judgment with Yourself. 







###### 4 



Who can make the clean out of the unclean? No one! 







###### 5 



Since his days are determined, The number of his months is with You; And You have [^c]set his limits so that he cannot pass. 







###### 6 



Look away from him so that he may [^d]rest, Until he [^e]fulfills his day like a hired worker. 







###### 7 



"For there is hope for a tree, When it is cut down, that it will sprout again, And its shoots will not [^f]fail. 







###### 8 



Though its roots grow old in the ground, And its stump dies in the dry soil, 







###### 9 



At the scent of water it will flourish And produce sprigs like a plant. 







###### 10 



But a man dies and lies prostrate. A person passes away, and where is he? 







###### 11 



_As_ water [^g]evaporates from the sea, And a river becomes parched and dried up, 







###### 12 



So a man lies down and does not rise. Until the heavens no longer exist, [^h]He will not awake nor be woken from [^i]his sleep. 







###### 13 



"Oh that You would hide me in [^j]Sheol, That You would conceal me until Your wrath returns _to You_, That You would set a limit for me and remember me! 







###### 14 



If a man dies, will he live _again_? All the days of my struggle I will wait Until my relief comes. 







###### 15 



You will call, and I will answer You; You will long for the work of Your hands. 







###### 16 



For now You number my steps, You do not observe my sin. 







###### 17 



My wrongdoing is sealed up in a bag, And You cover over my [^k]guilt. 







###### 18 



"But the falling mountain [^l]crumbles away, And the rock moves from its place; 







###### 19 



Water wears away stones, Its torrents wash away the dust of the earth; So You destroy a man's hope. 







###### 20 



You forever overpower him and he departs; _You_ change his appearance and send him away. 







###### 21 



His sons achieve honor, but he does not know _it_; Or they become insignificant, and he does not perceive it. 







###### 22 



However, his [^m]body pains him, And his soul mourns for himself." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

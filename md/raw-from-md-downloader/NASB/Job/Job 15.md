# Job 15

***








###### 1 



Then Eliphaz the Temanite responded, 







###### 2 



"Should a wise man answer with windy knowledge, And fill [^a]himself with the east wind? 







###### 3 



Should he argue with useless talk, Or with words which do not benefit? 







###### 4 



Indeed, you do away with [^b]reverence, And hinder meditation before God. 







###### 5 



For your wrongdoing teaches your mouth, And you choose the language of the cunning. 







###### 6 



Your own mouth condemns you, and not I; And your own lips testify against you. 







###### 7 



"Were you the first person to be born, Or were you brought forth before the hills? 







###### 8 



Do you hear the secret discussion of God, And limit wisdom to yourself? 







###### 9 



What do you know that we do not know? _What_ do you understand that [^c]we do not? 







###### 10 



Both the gray-haired and the aged are among us, Older than your father. 







###### 11 



Are the consolations of God too little for you, Or the word _spoken_ gently to you? 







###### 12 



Why does your heart take you away? And why do your eyes wink, 







###### 13 



That you can turn your spirit against God And produce _such_ words from your mouth? 







###### 14 



What is man, that he would be pure, Or he who is born of a woman, that he would be righteous? 







###### 15 



Behold, He has no trust in His holy ones, And the heavens are not pure in His sight; 







###### 16 



How much less one who is detestable and corrupt: A person who drinks [^d]malice like water! ## What Eliphaz Has Seen of Life 







###### 17 



"I will tell you, listen to me; And what I have seen I will also declare; 







###### 18 



What wise people have told, And have not concealed from their fathers, 







###### 19 



To whom alone the land was given, And no stranger passed among them. 







###### 20 



The wicked person writhes in pain all _his_ days, And the [^e]years reserved for the ruthless are numbered. 







###### 21 



[^f]Sounds of terror are in his ears; _While he is_ at peace the destroyer comes upon him. 







###### 22 



He does not believe that he will return from darkness, And he is destined for the sword. 







###### 23 



He wanders about for food, _saying_, 'Where _is it_?' He knows that a day of darkness is [^g]at hand. 







###### 24 



Distress and anguish terrify him, They overpower him like a king ready for the attack, 







###### 25 



Because he has reached out with his hand against God, And is arrogant toward [^h]the Almighty. 







###### 26 



He rushes [^i]headlong at Him With his [^j]massive shield. 







###### 27 



For he has covered his face with his fat, And [^k]put fat on his waist. 







###### 28 



He has lived in desolate cities, In houses no one would inhabit, Which are destined to become [^l]ruins. 







###### 29 



He will not become rich, nor will his wealth endure; And his property will not stretch out on the earth. 







###### 30 



He will not [^m]escape from darkness; The flame will dry up his shoot, And he will go away by the breath of His mouth. 







###### 31 



Let him not trust in emptiness, deceiving himself; For his [^n]reward will be emptiness. 







###### 32 



It will be accomplished before his time, And his palm branch will not be green. 







###### 33 



He will drop off his unripe grape like the vine, And will cast off his flower like the olive tree. 







###### 34 



For the company of the godless is barren, And fire consumes the tents of [^o]the corrupt. 







###### 35 



They conceive [^p]harm and give birth to wrongdoing, And their [^q]mind prepares deception." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

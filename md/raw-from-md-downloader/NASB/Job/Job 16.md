# Job 16

***








###### 1 



Then Job responded, 







###### 2 



"I have heard many things like these; [^a]Miserable comforters are you all! 







###### 3 



Is there _no_ end to windy words? Or what provokes you that you answer? 







###### 4 



I too could speak like you, If only [^b]I were in your place. I could compose words against you And shake my head at you. 







###### 5 



_Or_ I could strengthen you with my mouth, And the condolence of my lips could lessen _your pain_. ## Job Says God Shattered Him 







###### 6 



"If I speak, my pain is not lessened, And if I refrain, what _pain_ leaves me? 







###### 7 



But now He has exhausted me; You have laid waste all my group _of loved ones_. 







###### 8 



And you have shriveled me up, [^c]It has become a witness; And my infirmity rises up against me, It testifies to my face. 







###### 9 



His anger has torn me and [^d]hunted me down, He has gnashed at me with His teeth; My enemy [^e]glares at me. 







###### 10 



They have gaped at me with their mouths, They have [^f]slapped me on the cheek with contempt; They have massed themselves against me. 







###### 11 



God hands me over to criminals, And tosses me into the hands of the wicked. 







###### 12 



I was at ease, but He shattered me, And He has grasped me by my neck and shaken me to pieces; He has also set me up as His target. 







###### 13 



His arrows surround me. He splits my kidneys open without mercy; He pours out my bile on the ground. 







###### 14 



He breaks through me with breach after breach; He runs at me like a warrior. 







###### 15 



I have sewed sackcloth over my skin, And thrust my horn in the dust. 







###### 16 



My face is flushed from weeping, And deep darkness is on my eyelids, 







###### 17 



Although there is no violence in my hands, And my prayer is pure. 







###### 18 



"Earth, do not cover my blood, And may there be no _resting_ place for my cry. 







###### 19 



Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven, And my [^g]advocate is on high. 







###### 20 



My friends are my scoffers; My eye weeps to God, 







###### 21 



That one might plead for a man with God As a son of man with his neighbor! 







###### 22 



For when a few years are past, I shall go the way of no return. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

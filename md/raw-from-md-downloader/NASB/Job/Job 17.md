# Job 17

***








###### 1 



"My spirit is broken, my days are extinguished, The [^a]grave is _ready_ for me. 







###### 2 



Mockers are certainly with me, And my eye [^b]gazes on their provocation. 







###### 3 



"Make a pledge for me with Yourself; Who is there that will [^c]be my guarantor? 







###### 4 



For You have [^d]kept their hearts away from understanding; Therefore You will not exalt _them_. 







###### 5 



He who informs against friends for a share _of the spoils_, The eyes of his children also will perish. 







###### 6 



"But He has made me a proverb _among_ the people, And I am [^e]one at whom people spit. 







###### 7 



My eye has also become inexpressive because of grief, And all my body parts are like a shadow. 







###### 8 



The upright will be appalled at this, And the innocent will stir himself up against the godless. 







###### 9 



Nevertheless the righteous will hold to his way, And the one who has clean hands will grow stronger and stronger. 







###### 10 



But come again all of [^f]you now, For I do not find a wise man among you. 







###### 11 



My days are past, my plans are torn apart, The wishes of my heart. 







###### 12 



They make night into day, _saying_, 'The light is near,' in the presence of darkness. 







###### 13 



If I hope for [^g]Sheol as my home, I [^h]make my bed in the darkness; 







###### 14 



_If_ I call to the grave, 'You are my father'; To the maggot, 'my mother and my sister'; 







###### 15 



Where then is my hope? And who looks at my hope? 







###### 16 



[^i]Will it go down with me to Sheol? Shall we together go down into the dust?" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Job 18

***








###### 1 



Then Bildad the Shuhite responded, 







###### 2 



"How long will you hunt for words? Show understanding, and then we can talk. 







###### 3 



Why are we regarded as animals, As stupid in your eyes? 







###### 4 



[^a]You who tear yourself in your anger-- Should the earth be abandoned for your sake, Or the rock moved from its place? 







###### 5 



"Indeed, the light of the wicked goes out, And the spark from his fire does not shine. 







###### 6 



The light in his tent is darkened, And his lamp goes out above him. 







###### 7 



His [^b]vigorous stride is shortened, And his own plan brings him down. 







###### 8 



For he is thrown into the net by his own feet, And he steps on the webbing. 







###### 9 



A snare seizes _him_ by the heel, _And_ a trap snaps shut on him. 







###### 10 



A noose for him is hidden in the ground, And a trap for him on the pathway. 







###### 11 



All around sudden terrors frighten him, And harass him at every step. 







###### 12 



His strength is famished, And disaster is ready at his side. 







###### 13 



[^c]It devours parts of his skin, The firstborn of death devours his [^d]limbs. 







###### 14 



He is torn from [^e]the security of his tent, And [^f]they march him before the king of terrors. 







###### 15 



[^g]Nothing of his dwells in his tent; Brimstone is scattered on his home. 







###### 16 



His roots are dried below, And his branch withers above. 







###### 17 



The memory of him perishes from the earth, And he has no name abroad. 







###### 18 



[^h]He is driven from light into darkness, And chased from the inhabited world. 







###### 19 



He has no offspring or descendants among his people, Nor any survivor where he resided. 







###### 20 



Those in the west are appalled at his [^i]fate, And those in the east are seized with horror. 







###### 21 



Certainly these are the dwellings of the wicked, And this is the place of him who does not know God." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Job 19

***








###### 1 



Then Job responded, 







###### 2 



"How long will you torment [^a]me And crush me with words? 







###### 3 



These ten times you have insulted me; You are not ashamed to wrong me. 







###### 4 



Even _if_ I have truly done wrong, My error stays with me. 







###### 5 



If indeed you exalt yourselves against me And prove my disgrace to me, 







###### 6 



Know then that God has wronged me And has surrounded me with His net. ## Everything Is Against Him 







###### 7 



"Behold, I cry, 'Violence!' but I get no answer; I shout for help, but there is no justice. 







###### 8 



He has blocked my way so that I cannot pass, And He has put darkness on my paths. 







###### 9 



He has stripped my honor from me And removed the crown from my head. 







###### 10 



He breaks me down on every side, and I am gone; And He has uprooted my hope like a tree. 







###### 11 



He has also kindled His anger against me And considered me as His enemy. 







###### 12 



His troops come together And build up their [^b]way against me And camp around my tent. 







###### 13 



"He has removed my brothers far from me, And my acquaintances have completely turned away from me. 







###### 14 



My relatives have failed, And my close friends have forgotten me. 







###### 15 



Those who live in my house and my servant women consider me a stranger. I am a foreigner in their sight. 







###### 16 



I call to my servant, but he does not answer; I have to implore his favor with my mouth. 







###### 17 



My breath is offensive to my wife, And I am loathsome to my own brothers. 







###### 18 



Even young children despise me; I stand up and they speak against me. 







###### 19 



All [^c]my associates loathe me, And those I love have turned against me. 







###### 20 



My bone clings to my skin and my flesh, And I have escaped _only_ by the skin of my teeth. 







###### 21 



Pity me, pity me, you friends of mine, For the hand of God has struck me. 







###### 22 



Why do you persecute me as God _does_, And are not satisfied with my flesh? ## Job Says My Redeemer Lives 







###### 23 



"Oh that my words were written! Oh that they were recorded in a book! 







###### 24 



That with an iron stylus and lead They were engraved in the rock forever! 







###### 25 



Yet as for me, I know that my Redeemer lives, And at the last, He will take His stand on the [^d]earth. 







###### 26 



Even after my skin [^e]is destroyed, Yet from my flesh I will see God, 







###### 27 



Whom I, on my part, shall behold for myself, And _whom_ my eyes will see, and not another. My [^f]heart faints [^g]within me! 







###### 28 



If you say, 'How shall we persecute him?' And '[^h]What pretext for a case against him can we find?' 







###### 29 



_Then_ be afraid of the sword for yourselves, For wrath _brings_ the punishment of the sword, So that you may know there is judgment." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Job 20

***








###### 1 



Then Zophar the Naamathite responded, 







###### 2 



"Therefore my disquieting thoughts make me [^a]respond, Even because of my [^b]inward agitation. 







###### 3 



I listened to the reprimand which insults me, And the spirit of my understanding makes me answer. 







###### 4 



Do you know this from ancient times, From the establishment of mankind on earth, 







###### 5 



That the rejoicing of the wicked is short, And the joy of the godless momentary? 







###### 6 



Though his arrogance [^c]reaches the heavens, And his head touches the clouds, 







###### 7 



He perishes forever like his refuse; Those who have seen him will say, 'Where is he?' 







###### 8 



He flies away like a dream, and they cannot find him; Like a vision of the night he is chased away. 







###### 9 



The eye which saw him sees him no longer, And his place no longer beholds him. 







###### 10 



His sons [^d]favor the poor, And his hands give back his wealth. 







###### 11 



His bones are full of his youthful strength, But it lies down with him [^e]in the dust. 







###### 12 



"Though evil tastes sweet in his mouth _And_ he hides it under his tongue, 







###### 13 



_Though_ he [^f]desires it and will not let it go, But holds it in his [^g]mouth, 







###### 14 



_Yet_ his food in his stomach is changed To the [^h]venom of cobras within him. 







###### 15 



He swallows riches, But will vomit them up; God will expel them from his belly. 







###### 16 



He sucks the poison of cobras; The viper's tongue kills him. 







###### 17 



He does not look at the streams, The rivers flowing with honey and curds. 







###### 18 



He returns the product of his labor And cannot swallow _it_; As to the riches of his trading, He cannot even enjoy _them_. 







###### 19 



For he has oppressed _and_ neglected the poor; He has seized a house which he has not built. 







###### 20 



"Because he knew no quiet [^i]within him, He does not retain anything he desires. 







###### 21 



Nothing remains [^j]for him to devour, Therefore his prosperity does not endure. 







###### 22 



In the fullness of his excess he will be cramped; The hand of everyone who suffers will come _against_ him. 







###### 23 



When he fills his belly, _God_ will send His fierce anger on him And rain _it_ on him [^k]while he is eating. 







###### 24 



He may flee from the iron weapon, _But_ the bronze bow will pierce him. 







###### 25 



It is drawn and comes out of his back, Even the flashing _point_ from his gallbladder; Terrors come upon him, 







###### 26 



Complete darkness is held in reserve for his treasures, And unfanned fire will devour him; It will consume the survivor in his tent. 







###### 27 



The heavens will reveal his guilt, And the earth will rise up against him. 







###### 28 



The increase of his house will disappear; _His possessions_ will flow away on the day of His anger. 







###### 29 



This is a wicked person's portion from God, The inheritance decreed to him by God." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Job 21

***








###### 1 



Then Job responded, 







###### 2 



"Listen carefully to my speech, And let this be your _way of_ consolation. 







###### 3 



Bear with me that I may speak; Then after I have spoken, you may mock _me_. 







###### 4 



As for me, is my complaint [^a]to a mortal? Or why should [^b]I not be impatient? 







###### 5 



Look at me, and be astonished, And put _your_ hand over _your_ mouth. 







###### 6 



Even when I remember, I am disturbed, And horror takes hold of my flesh. 







###### 7 



Why do the wicked _still_ live, Grow old, _and_ also become very [^c]powerful? 







###### 8 



Their [^d]descendants endure with them in their sight, And their offspring before their eyes, 







###### 9 



Their houses are safe from fear, And the [^e]rod of God is not on them. 







###### 10 



His ox mates [^f]without fail; His cow calves and does not miscarry. 







###### 11 



They send out their boys like the flock, And their children dance. 







###### 12 



They [^g]sing with the tambourine and harp, And rejoice at the sound of the flute. 







###### 13 



They spend their days in prosperity, And [^h]suddenly they go down to [^i]Sheol. 







###### 14 



Yet they say to God, 'Go away from us! We do not even desire the knowledge of Your ways. 







###### 15 



[^j]Who is [^k]the Almighty, that we should serve Him, And what would we gain if we plead with Him?' 







###### 16 



Behold, their prosperity is not in their hand; The advice of the wicked is far from me. 







###### 17 



"How often is the lamp of the wicked put out, Or does their disaster fall on them? Does [^l]God apportion destruction in His anger? 







###### 18 



Are they as straw before the wind, And like chaff which the storm carries away? 







###### 19 



_You say_, 'God saves up [^m]a person's [^n]wrongdoing for his sons.' Let [^o]God repay him so that he may know _it_. 







###### 20 



Let his own eyes see his destruction, And let him drink of the wrath of [^p]the Almighty. 







###### 21 



For what does he care about his household [^q]after him, When the number of his months is at an end? 







###### 22 



Can anyone teach God knowledge, In that He judges those on high? 







###### 23 



One dies in his full strength, Being wholly undisturbed and at ease; 







###### 24 



His [^r]sides are filled with fat, And the marrow of his bones is wet, 







###### 25 



While another dies with a bitter soul, Never even [^s]tasting _anything_ good. 







###### 26 



Together they lie down in the dust, And maggots cover them. 







###### 27 



"Behold, I know your thoughts, And the plots you devise against me. 







###### 28 



For you say, 'Where is the house of the nobleman, And where is the tent, the dwelling places of the wicked?' 







###### 29 



Have you not asked travelers, And do you not examine their [^t]evidence? 







###### 30 



For the wicked person is spared [^u]a day of disaster; They [^v]are led _away_ from a day of fury. 







###### 31 



Who [^w]confronts him with his actions, And who repays him for what he has done? 







###### 32 



When he is carried to the grave, _People_ will keep watch over _his_ tomb. 







###### 33 



The clods of the valley will [^x]gently cover him; Moreover, all mankind will [^y]follow after him, While countless _others go_ before him. 







###### 34 



So how dare you give me empty comfort?

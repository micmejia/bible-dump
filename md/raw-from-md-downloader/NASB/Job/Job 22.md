# Job 22

***








###### 1 



Then Eliphaz the Temanite responded, 







###### 2 



"Can a strong man be of use to God, Or a wise one be useful to himself? 







###### 3 



Is _it any_ pleasure to [^a]the Almighty if you are righteous, Or gain if you make your ways blameless? 







###### 4 



Is it because of your [^b]reverence that He punishes you, That He enters into judgment against you? 







###### 5 



Is your wickedness not abundant, And is there no end to your guilty deeds? 







###### 6 



For you have seized pledges from your brothers without cause, And [^c]stripped people naked. 







###### 7 



You have given the weary no water to drink, And you have withheld bread from the hungry. 







###### 8 



But the earth belongs to the powerful man, And the one who is honorable dwells on it. 







###### 9 



You have sent widows away empty, And the [^d]strength of orphans has been crushed. 







###### 10 



Therefore traps surround you, And sudden dread terrifies you, 







###### 11 



Or darkness, _so that_ you cannot see, And a flood of water covers you. 







###### 12 



"Is God not _in_ the height of heaven? Look also at the [^e]highest stars, how high they are! 







###### 13 



But you say, 'What does God know? Can He judge through the thick darkness? 







###### 14 



Clouds are a hiding place for Him, so that He cannot see; And He walks on the [^f]vault of heaven.' 







###### 15 



Will you keep to the ancient path Which wicked people have walked, 







###### 16 



Who were snatched away before their time, Whose foundations were [^g]washed away _by_ a river? 







###### 17 



They said to God, 'Go away from us!' And 'What can [^h]the Almighty do to them?' 







###### 18 



Yet He filled their houses with good _things_; But the advice of the wicked is far from me. 







###### 19 



The righteous see and are glad, And the innocent mock them, _saying_, 







###### 20 



'Truly our enemies are eliminated, And fire has consumed their [^i]abundance.' 







###### 21 



"Be reconciled with Him, and be at peace; Thereby good will come to you. 







###### 22 



Please receive [^j]instruction from His mouth, And put His words in your heart. 







###### 23 



If you return to [^k]the Almighty, you will be [^l]restored; _If_ you remove injustice far from your tent, 







###### 24 



And put _your_ [^m]gold in the dust, And _the gold of_ Ophir among the stones of the brooks, 







###### 25 



Then [^n]the Almighty will be your [^o]gold And abundant silver to you. 







###### 26 



For then you will take pleasure in [^p]the Almighty And lift up your face to God. 







###### 27 



You will pray to Him, and He will hear you; And you will pay your vows. 







###### 28 



You will also decide something, and it will be established for you; And light will shine on your ways. 







###### 29 



When [^q]they have brought _you_ low, you will speak with [^r]confidence, And He will save the [^s]humble person. 







###### 30 



He will rescue one who is not innocent, And he will be rescued due to the cleanness of your hands." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

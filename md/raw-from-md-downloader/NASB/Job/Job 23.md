# Job 23

***








###### 1 



Then Job responded, 







###### 2 



"Even today my complaint is rebellion; [^a]His hand is heavy despite my groaning. 







###### 3 



Oh that I knew how to find Him, That I might come to His home! 







###### 4 



I would present _my_ case before Him And fill my mouth with arguments. 







###### 5 



I would learn the words _which_ He would [^b]answer, And perceive what He would tell me. 







###### 6 



Would He contend with me by the greatness of _His_ power? No, surely He would pay attention to me. 







###### 7 



There the upright would argue with Him; And I [^c]would be free of my Judge forever. 







###### 8 



"Behold, I go forward but He is not _there_, And backward, but I cannot perceive Him; 







###### 9 



When He acts on the left, I cannot see _Him_; He turns to the right, but I cannot see Him. 







###### 10 



But He knows the [^d]way I take; _When_ He has put me to the test, I will come out as gold. 







###### 11 



My foot has held on to His path; I have kept His way and not turned aside. 







###### 12 



I have not [^e]failed the command of His lips; I have treasured the words of His mouth [^f]more than my [^g]necessary food. 







###### 13 



But He is unique, and who can [^h]make Him turn? _Whatever_ His soul desires, He does _it_. 







###### 14 



For He carries out what is destined for me, And many such _destinies_ are with Him. 







###### 15 



Therefore, I would be terrified at His presence; _When_ I consider _this_, I am frightened of Him. 







###### 16 



_It is_ God _who_ has made my heart faint, And the Almighty _who_ has terrified me, 







###### 17 



But I am not destroyed by darkness, Nor by deep gloom _which_ covers me. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

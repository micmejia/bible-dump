# Job 24

***








###### 1 



"Why are [^a]times not stored up by the Almighty, And _why_ do those who know Him not see His [^b]days? 







###### 2 



_People_ remove landmarks; They seize and [^c]devour flocks. 







###### 3 



They drive away the donkeys of orphans; They seize the widow's ox as a pledge. 







###### 4 



They push the needy aside from the road; The poor of the land have to hide themselves together. 







###### 5 



Behold, _like_ wild donkeys in the wilderness They go out scavenging for food in their activity, As [^d]bread for _their_ children in the desert. 







###### 6 



They harvest their feed in the field And glean the vineyard of the wicked. 







###### 7 



They spend the night naked, without clothing, And have no covering against the cold. 







###### 8 



They are wet from the mountain rains, And they hug the rock for lack of a shelter. 







###### 9 



_Others_ snatch an orphan from the breast, And they seize _it_ as a pledge against the poor. 







###### 10 



_The poor_ move about naked without clothing, And they carry sheaves, _while going_ hungry. 







###### 11 



Within the walls they produce oil; They tread wine presses but go thirsty. 







###### 12 



From the city people groan, And the souls of the wounded cry for help; Yet God does not pay attention to the offensiveness. 







###### 13 



"[^e]Others have been with those who rebel against the light; They do not want to know its ways Nor stay in its paths. 







###### 14 



The murderer arises at dawn; He kills the poor and the needy, And at night he is like a thief. 







###### 15 



The eye of the adulterer watches for [^f]twilight, Saying, 'No eye will see me.' And he [^g]disguises his face. 







###### 16 



In the darkness they dig into houses, They shut themselves up by day; They do not know the light. 







###### 17 



For the morning is the same to him as thick darkness, For he is familiar with the terrors of thick darkness. 







###### 18 



"They are [^h]insignificant on the surface of the water; Their plot of land on the earth is cursed. They do not turn [^i]toward the vineyards. 







###### 19 



Dryness and heat snatch away the snow waters, _As_ [^j]Sheol _snatches those who_ have sinned. 







###### 20 



A [^k]mother will forget him; The maggot feeds sweetly until he is no longer remembered. And injustice will be broken like a tree. 







###### 21 



He wrongs the [^l]infertile woman, And does no good for the widow. 







###### 22 



But He drags off the mighty by His power; He rises, but no one has assurance of life. 







###### 23 



He provides them with security, and they are supported; And His eyes are on their ways. 







###### 24 



They are exalted a little while, then they are gone; Moreover, they are brought low, _and_ like everything they are gathered up; Like the heads of grain they wither. 







###### 25 



Now if it is not so, who can prove me a liar, And make my speech worthless?" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

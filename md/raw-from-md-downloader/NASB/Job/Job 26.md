# Job 26

***








###### 1 



Then Job responded, 







###### 2 



"What a help you are to [^a]the weak! You have saved the arm without strength! 







###### 3 



What advice you have given to _one_ without wisdom! What helpful insight you have abundantly [^b]provided! 







###### 4 



To whom have you uttered words? And whose [^c]spirit was expressed through you? ## The Greatness of God 







###### 5 



"The [^d]departed spirits are made to tremble Under the waters and their inhabitants. 







###### 6 



[^e]Sheol is naked before Him, And [^f]Abaddon has no covering. 







###### 7 



He stretches out the north over empty space And hangs the earth on nothing. 







###### 8 



He wraps up the waters in His clouds, And the cloud does not burst under them. 







###### 9 



He [^g]obscures the face of the [^h]full moon And spreads His cloud over it. 







###### 10 



He has inscribed a circle on the surface of the waters At the boundary of light and darkness. 







###### 11 



The pillars of heaven tremble And are amazed at His rebuke. 







###### 12 



With His power He quieted the sea, And by His understanding He shattered [^i]Rahab. 







###### 13 



By His breath the heavens are [^j]cleared; His hand has pierced the fleeing serpent. 







###### 14 



Behold, these are the fringes of His ways; And how faint a word we hear of Him! But His mighty thunder, who can understand?" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

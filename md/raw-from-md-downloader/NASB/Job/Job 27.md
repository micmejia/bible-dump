# Job 27

***








###### 1 



Job again took up his discourse and said, 







###### 2 



"As God lives, who has taken away my right, And the Almighty, who has embittered my soul, 







###### 3 



For as long as [^a]life is in me, And the [^b]breath of God is in my nostrils, 







###### 4 



My lips certainly will not speak unjustly, Nor will my tongue mutter deceit. 







###### 5 



Far be it from me that I should declare you right; Until I die, I will not [^c]give up my integrity. 







###### 6 



I have kept hold of my righteousness and will not let it go. My heart does not rebuke any of my days. ## The State of the Godless 







###### 7 



"May my enemy be as the wicked, And [^d]my opponent as the criminal. 







###### 8 



For what is the hope of the godless when he makes an end _of life_, When God requires his [^e]life? 







###### 9 



Will God hear his cry When distress comes upon him? 







###### 10 



Or will he take pleasure in the Almighty? Will he call on God at all times? 







###### 11 



I will instruct you in the [^f]power of God; What is with the Almighty I will not conceal. 







###### 12 



Behold, all of you have seen _it_; Why then do you talk of nothing? 







###### 13 



"This is the portion of a wicked person from God, And the inheritance _which_ tyrants receive from the Almighty: 







###### 14 



Though his sons are many, [^g]they are destined for the sword; And his descendants will not be satisfied with bread. 







###### 15 



His survivors will be buried because of the plague, And [^h]their widows will not _be able to_ weep. 







###### 16 



Though he piles up silver like dust, And prepares garments as _plentiful as_ the clay, 







###### 17 



He may prepare _it_, but the righteous will wear _it_ And the innocent will divide the silver. 







###### 18 



He has built his house like the [^i]spider's web, Or a hut _which_ the watchman has made. 







###### 19 



He lies down rich, but never [^j]again; He opens his eyes, and it no _longer_ exists. 







###### 20 



Terrors overtake him like a flood; A storm steals him away in the night. 







###### 21 



The east wind carries him away, and he is gone; For it sweeps him away from his place. 







###### 22 



For it will hurl at him without mercy; He will certainly try to flee from its [^k]power. 







###### 23 



_People_ will [^l]clap their hands at him, And will whistle at him from their places. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Job 28

***








###### 1 



"Certainly there is a [^a]mine for silver And a place [^b]for refining gold. 







###### 2 



Iron is taken from the dust, And copper is smelted from rock. 







###### 3 



_Man_ puts an end to darkness, And to the farthest limit he searches out The rock in gloom and deep shadow. 







###### 4 



He [^c]sinks a shaft away from [^d]inhabited areas, Forgotten by the foot; They hang _and_ swing, away from people. 







###### 5 



[^e]From the earth comes food, And underneath, it is turned over like fire. 







###### 6 



Its rocks are the [^f]source of sapphires, And its dust _contains_ gold. 







###### 7 



No bird of prey knows the path, Nor has the falcon's eye caught sight of it. 







###### 8 



The [^g]proud animals have not trodden it, Nor has the lion passed over it. 







###### 9 



He puts his hand on the flint; He overturns the mountains at the [^h]base. 







###### 10 



He carves out channels through the rocks, And his eye sees anything precious. 







###### 11 



He dams up the streams from [^i]flowing, And brings to light what is hidden. ## The Search for Wisdom Is Harder 







###### 12 



"But where can wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding? 







###### 13 



Mankind does not know its value, Nor is it found in the land of the living. 







###### 14 



The ocean depth says, 'It is not in me'; And the sea says, 'It is not with me.' 







###### 15 



Pure gold cannot be given in exchange for it, Nor can silver be weighed as its price. 







###### 16 



It cannot be valued in the gold of Ophir, In precious onyx, or sapphire. 







###### 17 



Gold or glass cannot equal it, Nor can it be exchanged for articles of pure gold. 







###### 18 



Coral and crystal are not to be mentioned; And the acquisition of wisdom is more _valuable_ than pearls. 







###### 19 



The topaz of [^j]Cush cannot equal it, Nor can it be valued in pure gold. 







###### 20 



Where then does wisdom come from? And where is this place of understanding? 







###### 21 



It is hidden from the eyes of every living _creature_, And concealed from the birds of the sky. 







###### 22 



[^k]Abaddon and Death say, 'With our ears we have heard a report of it.' 







###### 23 



"God understands its way, And He knows its place. 







###### 24 



For He looks to the ends of the earth; He sees everything under the heavens. 







###### 25 



When He imparted weight to the wind, And assessed the waters by measure, 







###### 26 



When He made a limit for the rain, And a course for the thunderbolt, 







###### 27 



Then He saw it and declared it; He established it and also searched it out. 







###### 28 



And to mankind He said, 'Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; And to turn away from evil is understanding.'" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

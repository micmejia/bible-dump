# Job 29

***








###### 1 



Job again took up his discourse and said, 







###### 2 



"Oh that I were as in months gone by, As in the days when God watched over me; 







###### 3 



When His lamp shone over my head, _And_ by His light I walked _through_ darkness; 







###### 4 



Just as I was in the days of my youth, When the protection of God _was_ over my tent; 







###### 5 



When [^a]the Almighty was still with me, _And_ my children were around me; 







###### 6 



When my steps were bathed in cream, And the rock poured out streams of oil for me! 







###### 7 



When I went out to the gate of the city, When I [^b]took my seat in the public square, 







###### 8 



The young men saw me and hid themselves, And the old men arose _and_ stood. 







###### 9 



The leaders stopped talking And put _their_ hands on their mouths; 







###### 10 



The voices of the prominent people were [^c]hushed, And their tongues stuck to their palates. 







###### 11 



For _when_ an ear heard, it called me blessed, And when an eye saw, it testified in support of me, 







###### 12 



Because I saved the poor who cried for help, And the orphan who had no helper. 







###### 13 



The blessing of the one who was about to perish came upon me, And I made the widow's heart sing for joy. 







###### 14 



I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; My justice was like a robe and a headband. 







###### 15 



I was eyes to those who were blind, And feet to those who [^d]could not walk. 







###### 16 



I was a father to the poor, And I investigated the case which I did not know. 







###### 17 



I broke the jaws of the wicked And rescued the prey from his teeth. 







###### 18 



Then I [^e]thought, 'I will die with my [^f]family, And I will multiply _my_ days as the sand. 







###### 19 



My root is spread out to the waters, And dew lies on my branch all night. 







###### 20 



My glory is _ever_ new with me, And my bow is renewed in my hand.' 







###### 21 



"To me they listened and waited, And they kept silent for my advice. 







###### 22 



After my words they did not _speak_ again, And my speech dropped on them. 







###### 23 



They waited for me as for the rain, And opened their mouths as for the late rain. 







###### 24 



I smiled at them _when_ they did not believe, And they did not look at [^g]my kindness ungraciously. 







###### 25 



I chose a way for them and sat as chief, And lived as a king among the troops, As one who comforted the mourners. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

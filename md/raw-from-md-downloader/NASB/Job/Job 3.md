# Job 3

***








###### 1 



Afterward Job opened his mouth and cursed [^a]the day of his _birth_. 







###### 2 



And Job [^b]said, 







###### 3 



"May the day on which I was to be born perish, As well as the night _which_ said, 'A [^c]boy is conceived.' 







###### 4 



May that day be darkness; May God above not care for it, Nor light shine on it. 







###### 5 



May darkness and black gloom claim it; May a cloud settle on it; May the blackness of the day terrify it. 







###### 6 



_As for_ that night, may darkness seize it; May it not rejoice among the days of the year; May it not come into the number of the months. 







###### 7 



Behold, may that night be barren; May no joyful shout enter it. 







###### 8 



May those curse it who curse the day, Who are [^d]prepared to disturb Leviathan. 







###### 9 



May the stars of its twilight be darkened; May it wait for light but have none, And may it not see the [^e]breaking dawn; 







###### 10 



Because it did not shut the opening of my _mother's_ womb, Or hide trouble from my eyes. 







###### 11 



"Why did I not die [^f]at birth, Come out of the womb and pass away? 







###### 12 



Why were the knees _there_ in front of me, And why the breasts, that I would nurse? 







###### 13 



For now I would have lain down and been quiet; I would have slept then, I would have been at rest, 







###### 14 



With kings and counselors of the earth, Who rebuilt ruins for themselves; 







###### 15 



Or with rulers who had gold, Who were filling their houses _with_ silver. 







###### 16 



Or like a miscarriage which is [^g]hidden, I would not exist, As infants that never saw light. 







###### 17 



There the wicked cease from raging, And there the [^h]weary are at rest. 







###### 18 



The prisoners are at ease together; They do not hear the voice of the taskmaster. 







###### 19 



The small and the great are there, And the slave is free from his master. 







###### 20 



"Why is light given to one burdened with grief, And life to the bitter of soul, 







###### 21 



Who [^i]long for death, but there is none, And dig for it more than for hidden treasures; 







###### 22 



Who are filled with jubilation, _And_ rejoice when they find the grave? 







###### 23 



_Why is light given_ to a man whose way is hidden, And whom God has shut off? 







###### 24 



For my groaning comes at the sight of my food, And my cries pour out like water. 







###### 25 



For [^j]what I fear comes upon me, And what I dread [^k]encounters me. 







###### 26 



I am not at ease, nor am I quiet, And I am not at rest, but turmoil comes." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

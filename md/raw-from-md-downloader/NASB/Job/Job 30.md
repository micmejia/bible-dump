# Job 30

***








###### 1 



"But now those who are younger than I mock me, Whose fathers I refused to put with the dogs of my flock. 







###### 2 



Indeed, what _good was_ the strength of their hands to me? Vigor had perished from them. 







###### 3 



From poverty and famine they are gaunt, They who gnaw at the dry ground by night in waste and desolation, 







###### 4 



Who pluck saltweed by the bushes, And whose food is the root of the broom shrub. 







###### 5 



They are driven from the community; They shout against them as _against_ a thief, 







###### 6 



So that they live on the slopes of ravines, _In_ holes _in_ the ground and _among_ the rocks. 







###### 7 



Among the bushes they [^a]cry out; Under the weeds they are gathered together. 







###### 8 



Worthless [^b]fellows, even [^c]those without a name, They were cast out from the land. 







###### 9 



"And now I have become their [^d]taunt, And I have become a [^e]byword to them. 







###### 10 



They loathe me _and_ stand aloof from me, And they do not [^f]refrain from spitting in my face. 







###### 11 



Because He has undone [^g]my [^h]bowstring and afflicted me, They have cast off the bridle before me. 







###### 12 



On the right hand their [^i]mob arises; They push aside my feet and pile up their ways of destruction against me. 







###### 13 



They break up my path, They promote my destruction; No one restrains them. 







###### 14 



As _through_ a wide gap they come, [^j]Amid the storm they roll on. 







###### 15 



Sudden terrors are turned upon me; They chase _away_ my dignity like the wind, And my [^k]prosperity has passed away like a cloud. 







###### 16 



"And now my soul is poured out [^l]within me; Days of misery have seized me. 







###### 17 



At night it pierces my bones [^m]within me, And my gnawing _pains_ do not rest. 







###### 18 



By a great force my garment is distorted; It ties me up like the collar of my coat. 







###### 19 



He has thrown me into the mire, And I have become like dust and ashes. 







###### 20 



I cry out to You for help, but You do not answer me; I stand up, and You turn Your attention against me. 







###### 21 



You have [^n]become cruel to me; With the strength of Your hand You persecute me. 







###### 22 



You lift me up to the wind _and_ make me ride _it_; And You dissolve me in a storm. 







###### 23 



For I know that You will bring me to death, And to the house of meeting for all living. 







###### 24 



"Yet does one in a heap of ruins not reach out _with his_ hand, Or in his disaster does he not cry out for help? 







###### 25 



Have I not wept for the [^o]one whose life is hard? Was my soul not grieved for the needy? 







###### 26 



When I expected good, evil came; When I waited for light, darkness came. 







###### 27 



[^p]I am seething within and cannot rest; Days of misery confront me. 







###### 28 



I go about [^q]mourning without comfort; I stand up in the assembly _and_ cry out for help. 







###### 29 



I have become a brother to jackals, And a companion of ostriches. 







###### 30 



My skin turns black [^r]on me, And my bones burn with [^s]fever. 







###### 31 



Therefore my harp [^t]is turned to mourning, And my flute to the sound of those who weep. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

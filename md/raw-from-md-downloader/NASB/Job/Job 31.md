# Job 31

***








###### 1 



"I have made a covenant with my eyes; How then could I look at a virgin? 







###### 2 



And what is the portion of God from above, Or the inheritance of the Almighty from on high? 







###### 3 



Is it not disaster to the criminal, And misfortune to those who practice injustice? 







###### 4 



Does He not see my ways, And count all my steps? 







###### 5 



"If I have walked with deception, And my foot has hurried after deceit, 







###### 6 



Let Him weigh me with [^a]accurate scales, And let God know my integrity. 







###### 7 



If my step has turned from the way, Or my heart [^b]followed my eyes, Or _if any_ spot has stuck to my hands, 







###### 8 



Let me sow and another eat, And let my [^c]crops be uprooted. 







###### 9 



"If my heart has been enticed by a woman, Or I have lurked at my neighbor's doorway, 







###### 10 



May my wife grind _grain_ for another, And let others [^d]kneel down over her. 







###### 11 



For that would be a lustful crime; Moreover, it would be wrongdoing _punishable by_ judges. 







###### 12 



For it would be fire that consumes to [^e]Abaddon, And would uproot all my [^f]increase. 







###### 13 



"If I have rejected the claim of my male or female slaves When they filed a complaint against me, 







###### 14 



What then could I do when God arises? And when He calls me to account, how am I to answer Him? 







###### 15 



Did He who made me in the womb not make him, And the same one create us in the womb? 







###### 16 



"If I have kept the poor from _their_ desire, Or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail, 







###### 17 



Or have eaten my morsel alone, And the orphan has not [^g]shared it 







###### 18 



(But from my youth he grew up with me as with a father, And from [^h]my infancy I guided her), 







###### 19 



If I have seen anyone perish for lack of clothing, Or that the needy had no covering, 







###### 20 



If his waist has not [^i]thanked me, And if he has not been warmed with the fleece of my sheep, 







###### 21 



If I have lifted up my hand against the orphan, Because I saw [^j]I had support in the gate, 







###### 22 



May my shoulder fall from _its_ [^k]socket, And my arm be broken off [^l]at the elbow. 







###### 23 



For disaster from God is a terror to me, And because of His majesty I can do nothing. 







###### 24 



"If I have put my confidence _in_ gold, And called fine gold my trust, 







###### 25 



If I have gloated because my wealth was great, And because my hand had obtained _so_ much; 







###### 26 



If I have looked at the [^m]sun when it shone, Or the moon going in splendor, 







###### 27 



And my heart was secretly enticed, And my hand [^n]threw a kiss from my mouth, 







###### 28 



That too would have been a guilty deed _calling for_ [^o]judgment, For I would have denied God above. 







###### 29 



"Have I rejoiced at the misfortune of my enemy, Or become excited when evil found him? 







###### 30 



[^p]No, I have not [^q]allowed my mouth to sin By asking for his life in a curse. 







###### 31 



Have the people of my tent not said, 'Who can [^r]find one who has not been satisfied with his meat'? 







###### 32 



The stranger has not spent the night outside, _For_ I have opened my doors to the [^s]traveler. 







###### 33 



Have I covered my wrongdoings like a man, By hiding my guilt in my shirt pocket, 







###### 34 



Because I feared the great multitude And the contempt of families terrified me, And I kept silent and did not go out of doors? 







###### 35 



Oh that I had one to hear me! Here is my [^t]signature; Let the Almighty answer me! And the indictment which my adversary has written, 







###### 36 



I would certainly carry it on my shoulder, I would tie it to myself _like_ a garland. 







###### 37 



I would declare to Him the number of my steps; Like a prince, I would approach Him. 







###### 38 



"If my land cries out against me, And its furrows weep together; 







###### 39 



If I have eaten its [^u]fruit without money, Or have caused [^v]its owners to lose their lives, 







###### 40 



May the thorn-bush [^w]grow instead of wheat, And stinkweed instead of barley." The words of Job are ended. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

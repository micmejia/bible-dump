# Job 32

***








###### 1 



Then these three men stopped answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes. 







###### 2 



But the anger of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, burned against Job; his anger burned because he justified himself [^a]before God. 







###### 3 



And his anger burned against his three friends because they had found no answer, yet they had condemned Job. 







###### 4 



Now Elihu had waited [^b]to speak to Job because they were years older than he. 







###### 5 



But when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the three men, his anger burned. 







###### 6 



So Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite [^c]spoke out and said, "I am young in years and you are old; Therefore I was shy and afraid to tell you [^d]what I think. 







###### 7 



I [^e]thought [^f]age should speak, And [^g]increased years should teach wisdom. 







###### 8 



But it is a spirit _that is_ in mankind, And the breath of the Almighty gives them understanding. 







###### 9 



The [^h]abundant _in years_ may not be wise, Nor may elders understand justice. 







###### 10 



So I [^i]say, 'Listen to me, I too will tell [^j]what I think.' 







###### 11 



"Behold, I waited for your words, I listened to your skillful speech, While you [^k]pondered what to say. 







###### 12 



I also paid close attention to you; But [^l]indeed, there was no one who refuted Job, Not one of you who answered his words. 







###### 13 



So do not say, 'We have found wisdom: God will [^m]defeat him, not man.' 







###### 14 



But he has not presented _his_ words against me, Nor will I reply to him with your [^n]arguments. 







###### 15 



"They are dismayed, they no longer answer; Words have [^o]failed them. 







###### 16 



Should I wait, because they are not speaking, Because they have [^p]stopped _and_ no longer answer? 







###### 17 



I too will [^q]give my share of answers; I also will tell my opinion. 







###### 18 



For I am full of words; The spirit within me compels me. 







###### 19 



Behold, my belly is like unvented wine; Like new wineskins, it is about to burst. 







###### 20 



Let me speak so that I may get relief; Let me open my lips and answer. 







###### 21 



Let me be partial to no one, Nor flatter _any_ man. 







###### 22 



For I do not know how to flatter, _Otherwise_ my Maker would quickly take me away. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Job 33

***








###### 1 



"However, please hear my speech, Job, And listen to all my words. 







###### 2 



Behold now, I open my mouth, My tongue in my [^a]mouth speaks. 







###### 3 



My words are _from_ the integrity of my heart, And my lips speak knowledge sincerely. 







###### 4 



The Spirit of God has made me, And the breath of [^b]the Almighty gives me life. 







###### 5 



Refute me if you can; Line up against me, take your stand. 







###### 6 



Behold, I belong to God, like you; I too have been [^c]formed out of the clay. 







###### 7 



Behold, no fear of me should terrify you, Nor should my pressure weigh heavily on you. 







###### 8 



"You have in fact spoken [^d]while I listened, And I heard the sound of _your_ words: 







###### 9 



'I am pure, without wrongdoing; I am innocent and there is no guilt in me. 







###### 10 



Behold, He [^e]invents [^f]criticisms against me; He counts me as His enemy. 







###### 11 



He puts my feet in the stocks; He watches all my paths.' 







###### 12 



Behold, let me respond to you, you are not right in this, For God is greater than mankind. 







###### 13 



"Why do you complain to Him That He does not give an account of all His doings? 







###### 14 



Indeed God speaks once, Or twice, _yet_ no one notices it. 







###### 15 



In a dream, a vision of the night, When deep sleep falls on people, While they slumber in their beds, 







###### 16 



Then He opens the ears of people, And horrifies them with warnings, 







###### 17 



So that He may turn a person away _from bad_ conduct, And [^g]keep a man from pride; 







###### 18 



He keeps his soul back from the pit, And his life from perishing by the spear. 







###### 19 



"_A person_ is also rebuked by pain in his bed, And with constant complaint in his bones, 







###### 20 



So that his life loathes bread, And his soul, food [^h]that he should crave. 







###### 21 



His flesh wastes away from sight, And his bones, _which_ were not seen, stick out. 







###### 22 



Then his soul comes near to the pit, And his life to those who bring death. 







###### 23 



"If there is an interceding angel for him, One out of a thousand, To remind a person of what is [^i]right for him, 







###### 24 



And he is gracious to him, and says, 'Free him from going down to the pit, I have found a ransom'; 







###### 25 



Let his flesh become fresher than in youth, Let him return to the days of his youthful vigor; 







###### 26 



_Then_ he will pray to God, and He will accept him, So that he may see His face with joy, And He will restore His righteousness to _that_ person. 







###### 27 



He will sing to people and say, 'I have sinned and perverted what is right, And it is not proper for me. 







###### 28 



He has redeemed my soul from going to the pit, And my life will see the light.' 







###### 29 



"Behold, God does all these _things_ for a man two or three times, 







###### 30 



To bring back his soul from the pit, So that he may be enlightened with the light of life. 







###### 31 



Pay attention, Job, listen to me; Keep silent, and let me speak. 







###### 32 



_Then_ if [^j]you have anything to say, answer me; Speak, for I would take pleasure in justifying you. 







###### 33 



If not, listen to me; Keep silent, and I will teach you wisdom." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

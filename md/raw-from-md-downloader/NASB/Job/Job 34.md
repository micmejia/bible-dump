# Job 34

***








###### 1 



Then Elihu continued and said, 







###### 2 



"Hear my words, you wise men, And listen to me, you who understand. 







###### 3 



For the ear tests words As the palate tastes food. 







###### 4 



Let us choose for ourselves what is right; Let us understand among ourselves what is good. 







###### 5 



For Job has said, 'I am righteous, But God has taken away my right; 







###### 6 



[^a]Should I lie about my right? My [^b]wound is incurable, _though I am_ without wrongdoing.' 







###### 7 



What man is like Job, Who drinks up derision like water, 







###### 8 



Who goes in company with the workers of injustice, And walks with wicked people? 







###### 9 



For he has said, 'It is of no use to a man When he becomes friends with God.' 







###### 10 



"Therefore, listen to me, you men of understanding. Far be it from God to do evil, And from the Almighty to do wrong. 







###### 11 



For He repays a person for his work, And lets _things_ happen in correspondence to a man's [^c]behavior. 







###### 12 



God certainly will not act wickedly, And the Almighty will not pervert justice. 







###### 13 



Who gave Him authority over the earth? And who has placed the whole world _on Him_? 







###### 14 



If He were to [^d]determine to do so, If He were to gather His [^e]spirit and His breath to Himself, 







###### 15 



[^f]Humanity would perish together, And mankind would return to dust. 







###### 16 



"But if _you have_ understanding, hear this; Listen to the sound of my words. 







###### 17 



Shall one who hates justice rule? And will you condemn the righteous mighty One, 







###### 18 



Who says to a king, 'You worthless one,' To nobles, 'You wicked one'; 







###### 19 



Who shows no partiality to the prominent, Nor regards the rich as above the poor, Since they are all the work of His hands? 







###### 20 



In a moment they die, and at midnight People are shaken and pass away, And the powerful are taken away without a hand. 







###### 21 



"For His eyes are upon the ways of a person, And He sees all his steps. 







###### 22 



There is no darkness or deep shadow Where the workers of injustice can hide themselves. 







###### 23 



For He does not _need to_ consider a person further, That he should go before God in judgment. 







###### 24 



He breaks in pieces the mighty without investigation, And sets others in their place. 







###### 25 



Therefore He knows their deeds, And He overthrows _them_ in the night, And they are crushed. 







###### 26 



He strikes them like the wicked [^g]In a public place, 







###### 27 



Because they turned aside from following Him, And had no regard for any of His ways, 







###### 28 



So that they caused the cry of the poor to come to Him, And that He would hear the cry of the afflicted-- 







###### 29 



When He keeps quiet, who can condemn? And when He hides His face, who then can look at Him, That is, regarding both nation and a person?-- 







###### 30 



So that godless people would not rule, Nor be snares for the people. 







###### 31 



"For has anyone said to God, 'I have endured _punishment_; I will not offend _anymore_; 







###### 32 



Teach me what I do not see; If I have done wrong, I will not do it again'? 







###### 33 



Shall _God_ repay on your terms, because you have rejected _His_? For you must choose, and not I; Therefore declare what you know. 







###### 34 



Men of understanding will say to me, And a wise man who hears me, 







###### 35 



'Job speaks without knowledge, And his words are without wisdom. 







###### 36 



Oh that Job were tested [^h]to the limit, Because [^i]he answers like sinners. 







###### 37 



For he adds rebellion to his sin; He claps his hands among us, And multiplies his words against God.'" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

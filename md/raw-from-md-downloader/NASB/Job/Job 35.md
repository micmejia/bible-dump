# Job 35

***








###### 1 



Then Elihu continued and said, 







###### 2 



"Do you think this is in accordance with justice? Do you say, 'My righteousness is more than God's'? 







###### 3

###### 13 



God certainly will not listen to [^b]an empty _cry_, Nor will the Almighty regard it. 







###### 14 



How much less when you say you do not look at Him, The case is before Him, and you must wait for Him! 







###### 15 



And now, because He has not avenged His anger, Nor has He acknowledged [^c]wrongdoing well, 







###### 16 



So Job opens his mouth _with_ empty _words_; He multiplies words without knowledge." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

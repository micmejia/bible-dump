# Job 36

***








###### 1 



Then Elihu continued and said, 







###### 2 



"Wait for me a little, and I will show you That there [^a]is still more to be said on God's behalf. 







###### 3 



I will bring my knowledge from afar, And ascribe righteousness to my Maker. 







###### 4 



For truly my words are not false; One who is perfect in knowledge is with you. 







###### 5 



Behold, God is mighty but does not reject _anyone_; _He is_ mighty in strength of understanding. 







###### 6 



He does not keep the wicked alive, But gives justice to the afflicted. 







###### 7 



He does not withdraw His eyes from the righteous, But with kings on the throne He has seated them forever, and they are exalted. 







###### 8 



And if they are bound in shackles, And are caught in the snares of misery, 







###### 9 



Then He declares to them their work And their wrongdoings, that they have been arrogant. 







###### 10 



He opens their ears to instruction, And commands that they return from injustice. 







###### 11 



If they listen and serve _Him_, They will end their days in prosperity, And their years in happiness. 







###### 12 



But if they do not listen, they will [^b]perish by the sword, And die without knowledge. 







###### 13 



But the godless in heart nurture anger; They do not call for help when He binds them. 







###### 14 



[^c]They die in youth, And their life _perishes_ among the cult prostitutes. 







###### 15 



He rescues the afflicted in [^d]their misery, And opens their ears in _time of_ oppression. 







###### 16 



Then indeed, He induced you away from the mouth of distress, _And_ instead of it, a broad place with no constraint; And your table was full of [^e]rich food. 







###### 17 



"But you were full of judgment on the wicked; Judgment and justice take hold _of you_. 







###### 18 



_Beware_ that wrath does not entice you to mockery; And do not let the greatness of the ransom turn you aside. 







###### 19 



Will your cry for help keep you from distress, Or all the exertions of _your_ strength? 







###### 20 



Do not long for the night, When people [^f]vanish in their places. 







###### 21 



Be careful, do not turn to evil, For you preferred this to misery. 







###### 22 



Behold, God is exalted in His power; Who is a teacher like Him? 







###### 23 



Who has appointed Him His way, And who has said, 'You have done wrong'? 







###### 24 



"Remember that you are to exalt His work, Of which people have sung. 







###### 25 



All people have seen it; Mankind looks at it from afar. 







###### 26 



Behold, God is exalted, and we do not know _Him_; The number of His years is unsearchable. 







###### 27 



For He draws up the drops of water; They distill rain from its [^g]celestial stream, 







###### 28 



Which clouds pour down; They drip upon mankind abundantly. 







###### 29 



Can anyone understand the spreading of the clouds, The thundering of His [^h]pavilion? 







###### 30 



Behold, He spreads His [^i]lightning about Him, And He covers the depths of the sea. 







###### 31 



For by them He judges peoples; He gives food in abundance. 







###### 32 



He covers _His_ hands with the [^j]lightning, And commands it to strike the target. 







###### 33 



Its thundering voice declares [^k]His presence; The livestock also, concerning what is coming up. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Job 37

***








###### 1 



"At this also my heart trembles, And leaps from its place. 







###### 2 



Listen closely to the thunder of His voice, And the rumbling that goes out from His mouth. 







###### 3 



Under the whole heaven He lets it loose, And His [^a]lightning _travels_ to the ends of the earth. 







###### 4 



After it, a voice roars; He thunders with His majestic voice, And He does not restrain [^b]the lightning when His voice is heard. 







###### 5 



God thunders wondrously with His voice, Doing great things which we do not comprehend. 







###### 6 



For to the snow He says, 'Fall on the earth,' And to the [^c]downpour and the rain, 'Be strong.' 







###### 7 



He seals the hand of every person, So that all people may know His work. 







###### 8 



Then the animal goes into its lair And remains in its [^d]den. 







###### 9 



From the [^e]south comes the storm, And from the north wind the cold. 







###### 10 



From the breath of God ice is made, And the expanse of the waters is frozen. 







###### 11 



He also loads the clouds with moisture; He disperses the cloud of His [^f]lightning. 







###### 12 



It changes direction, turning around by His guidance, That [^g]it may do whatever He commands [^h]it On the face of the inhabited earth. 







###### 13 



Whether for [^i]correction, or for His earth, Or for goodness, He causes it to [^j]happen. 







###### 14 



"Listen to this, Job; Stand and consider the wonders of God. 







###### 15 



Do you know how God establishes them, And makes the [^k]lightning of His clouds to shine? 







###### 16 



Do you know about the hovering of the clouds, The wonders of One who is perfect in knowledge, 







###### 17 



You whose garments are hot When the land is still because of the south wind? 







###### 18 



Can you, with Him, spread out the skies, Strong as a cast metal mirror? 







###### 19 



Teach us what we are to say to Him; We cannot present _our case_ because of darkness. 







###### 20 



Shall it be told Him that I would speak? [^l]Or should a man say that he would be swallowed up? 







###### 21 



"Now _people_ do not see the light which is bright in the skies; But the wind has passed and cleared them. 







###### 22 



From the north comes golden _splendor_; Around God is awesome majesty. 







###### 23 



The Almighty--we cannot find Him; He is exalted in power And He will not violate justice and abundant righteousness. 







###### 24 



Therefore people fear Him; He does not regard any who are wise of heart." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Job 38

***








###### 1 



Then the LORD answered Job from the whirlwind and said, 







###### 2 



"Who is this who darkens _the divine_ plan By words without knowledge? 







###### 3 



Now [^a]tighten the belt on your waist like a man, And I shall ask you, and you inform Me! 







###### 4 



Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth? Tell _Me_, if you [^b]have understanding, 







###### 5 



Who set its measurements? Since you know. Or who stretched the measuring line over it? 







###### 6 



On what were its bases sunk? Or who laid its cornerstone, 







###### 7 



When the morning stars sang together And all the sons of God shouted for joy? 







###### 8 



"Or _who_ enclosed the sea with doors When it went out from the womb, bursting forth; 







###### 9 



When I made a cloud its garment, And thick darkness its swaddling bands, 







###### 10 



And I [^c]placed boundaries on it And set a bolt and doors, 







###### 11 



And I said, 'As far as this point you shall come, but no farther; And here your proud waves shall stop'? ## God's Mighty Power 







###### 12 



"Have you [^d]ever in your life commanded the morning, _And_ made the dawn know its place, 







###### 13 



So that it would take hold of the ends of the earth, And the wicked would be shaken off from it? 







###### 14 



It is changed like clay _under_ the seal; And they stand out like a garment. 







###### 15 



Their light is withheld from the wicked, And the uplifted arm is broken. 







###### 16 



"Have you entered the springs of the sea, And walked [^e]in the depth of the ocean? 







###### 17 



Have the gates of death been revealed to you, And have you seen the gates of deep darkness? 







###### 18 



Have you understood the [^f]expanse of the earth? Tell _Me_, if you know all this. 







###### 19 



"Where is the way to the dwelling of light? And darkness, where is its place, 







###### 20 



That you would take it to its territory, And discern the paths to its [^g]home? 







###### 21 



You know, for you were born then, And the number of your days is great! 







###### 22 



Have you entered the storehouses of the snow, And have you seen the storehouses of the hail, 







###### 23 



Which I have reserved for a time of distress, For a day of war and battle? 







###### 24 



Where is the way that the light is divided, _And_ the east wind scattered on the earth? 







###### 25 



"Who has split _open_ a channel for the flood, And a way for the thunderbolt, 







###### 26 



To bring rain on a land without [^h]people, _On_ a desert without a person in it, 







###### 27 



To satisfy the waste and desolate land, And to make the [^i]seeds of grass to sprout? 







###### 28 



Does the rain have a father? Or who has fathered the drops of dew? 







###### 29 



From whose womb has come the ice? And the frost of heaven, who has given it birth? 







###### 30 



Water [^j]becomes hard like stone, And the surface of the deep is imprisoned. 







###### 31 



"Can you tie up the chains of the Pleiades, Or untie the cords of Orion? 







###### 32 



Can you bring out a [^k]constellation in its season, And guide the Bear with her [^l]satellites? 







###### 33 



Do you know the ordinances of the heavens, Or do you establish their rule over the earth? 







###### 34 



"Can you raise your voice to the clouds, So that an abundance of water will cover you? 







###### 35 



Can you send flashes of lightning, so that they may go And say to you, 'Here we are'? 







###### 36 



Who has put wisdom in the innermost being, Or given understanding to the [^m]mind? 







###### 37 



Who can count the clouds by wisdom, And pour out the water jars of the heavens, 







###### 38 



When the dust hardens into a mass And the clods stick together? 







###### 39 



"Can you hunt the prey for the lioness, Or satisfy the appetite of young lions, 







###### 40 



When they crouch in _their_ hiding places, _And_ lie in wait in _their_ lair? 







###### 41 



Who prepares [^n]feed for the raven When its young cry to God, _And_ wander about without food? ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

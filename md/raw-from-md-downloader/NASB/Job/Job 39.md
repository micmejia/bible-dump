# Job 39

***








###### 1 



"Do you know the time the [^a]mountain goats give birth? Do you observe the calving of the deer? 







###### 2 



Can you count the months they fulfill, Or do you know the time they give birth? 







###### 3 



They kneel down, they deliver their young, They get rid of their labor pains. 







###### 4 



Their offspring become strong, they grow up in the open field; They leave and do not return to them. 







###### 5 



"Who sent the wild donkey out free? And who opened the bonds of the swift donkey, 







###### 6 



To whom I gave the wilderness as his home, And the salt land as his dwelling place? 







###### 7 



He laughs at the turmoil of the city, He does not hear the shouting of the taskmaster. 







###### 8 



He explores the mountains of his pasture, And searches after every green thing. 







###### 9 



Will the wild bull be willing to serve you, Or will he spend the night at your feeding trough? 







###### 10 



Can you tie down the wild bull in a furrow with [^b]ropes, Or will he [^c]plow the valleys after you? 







###### 11 



Will you trust him because his strength is great, And leave your labor to him? 







###### 12 



Will you have faith in him that he will return your [^d]grain And gather _it from_ your threshing floor? 







###### 13 



"The wings of the ostrich flap joyously, With the pinion and feathers of [^e]love, 







###### 14 



For she abandons her eggs to the earth And warms them in the dust, 







###### 15 



And she forgets that a foot may crush [^f]them, Or that a wild animal may trample [^g]them. 







###### 16 



She treats her young cruelly, as if _they_ were not hers; Though her labor is for nothing, _she_ is [^h]unconcerned, 







###### 17 



Because God has made her forget wisdom, And has not given her a share of understanding. 







###### 18 



When she rushes away on high, She laughs at the horse and his rider. 







###### 19 



"Do you give the horse _his_ might? Do you clothe his neck with a mane? 







###### 20 



Do you make him leap like locusts? His majestic snorting is frightening. 







###### 21 



[^i]He paws in the valley, and rejoices in _his_ strength; He goes out to meet the battle. 







###### 22 



He laughs at fear and is not dismayed; And he does not turn back from the sword. 







###### 23 



The quiver rattles against him, The flashing spear and javelin. 







###### 24 



He [^j]races over the ground with a roar and fury, And he does not stand still when _he hears_ the sound of the trumpet. 







###### 25 



As often as the trumpet _sounds_ he says, 'Aha!' And he senses the battle from afar, And the thunder of the captains and the war cry. 







###### 26 



"Is it by your understanding that the hawk soars, Stretching his wings toward the south? 







###### 27 



Is it at your [^k]command that the eagle flies high, And makes his nest on high? 







###### 28 



He dwells and spends his nights on the cliff, On the rocky cliff, an inaccessible place. 







###### 29 



From there he tracks food; His eyes look at _it_ from afar. 







###### 30 



His young ones also lick up blood greedily; And where the slain are, there he is." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Job 4

***








###### 1 



Then Eliphaz the Temanite responded, 







###### 2 



"If one ventures a word with you, will you become impatient? But who can refrain [^a]from speaking? 







###### 3 



Behold, you have taught many, And you have strengthened weak hands. 







###### 4 



Your words have helped the stumbling to stand, And you have strengthened [^b]feeble knees. 







###### 5 



But now it comes to you, and you are impatient; It touches you, and you are horrified. 







###### 6 



Is your [^c]fear _of God_ not your confidence, And the integrity of your ways your hope? 







###### 7 



"Remember now, who _ever_ perished being innocent? Or where were the upright destroyed? 







###### 8 



According to what I have seen, those who [^d]plow wrongdoing And those who sow trouble harvest it. 







###### 9 



By the breath of God they perish, And by the [^e]blast of His anger they come to an end. 







###### 10 



The roaring of the lion and the voice of the _fierce_ lion, And the teeth of the young lions are broken out. 







###### 11 



The lion perishes for lack of prey, And the cubs of the lioness are scattered. 







###### 12 



"Now a word was brought to me secretly, And my ear received a whisper of it. 







###### 13 



Amid disquieting thoughts from visions of the night, When deep sleep falls on people, 







###### 14 



Dread came upon me, and trembling, And made [^f]all my bones shake. 







###### 15 



Then a [^g]spirit passed by my face; The hair of my flesh stood up. 







###### 16 



_Something_ was standing still, but I could not recognize its appearance; A form _was_ before my eyes; _There was_ silence, then I heard a voice: 







###### 17 



'Can mankind be righteous [^h]before God? Can a man be pure [^i]before his Maker? 







###### 18 



He puts no trust even in His servants; And He accuses His angels of error. 







###### 19 



How much more those who live in houses of clay, Whose foundation is in the dust, Who are crushed before the moth! 







###### 20 



Between morning and evening they are broken in pieces; Unregarded, they perish forever. 







###### 21 



Is their tent-cord not pulled out within them? They die, yet without wisdom.' ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

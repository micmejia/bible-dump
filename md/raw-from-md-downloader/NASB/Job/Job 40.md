# Job 40

***








###### 1 



Then the LORD said to Job, 







###### 2 



"Will the faultfinder contend with the Almighty? Let him who rebukes God [^a]give an answer." 







###### 3 



Then Job answered the LORD and said, 







###### 4 



"Behold, I am insignificant; what can I say in response to You? I put my hand on my mouth. 







###### 5 



I have spoken once, and I will not reply; Or twice, and I will add nothing _more_." ## God Questions Job 







###### 6 



Then the LORD answered Job from the whirlwind and said, 







###### 7 



"Now [^b]tighten the belt on your waist like a man; I will ask you, and you instruct Me. 







###### 8 



Will you really nullify My judgment? Will you condemn Me so that you may be justified? 







###### 9 



Or do you have an arm like God, And can you thunder with a voice like His? 







###### 10 



"Adorn yourself with pride and dignity, And clothe yourself with honor and majesty. 







###### 11 



Let out your outbursts of anger, And look at everyone who is arrogant, and humble him. 







###### 12 



Look at everyone who is arrogant, _and_ humble him, And trample down the wicked [^c]where they stand. 







###### 13 



Hide them together in the dust; Imprison [^d]them in the hidden _place_. 







###### 14 



Then I will also [^e]confess to you, That your own right hand can save you. ## God's Power Shown in Creatures 







###### 15 



"Behold, [^f]Behemoth, which I made [^g]as well as you; He eats grass like an ox. 







###### 16 



Behold, his strength in his waist, And his power in the muscles of his belly. 







###### 17 



He hangs his tail like a cedar; The tendons of his thighs are knit together. 







###### 18 



His bones are tubes of bronze; His [^h]limbs are like bars of iron. 







###### 19 



"He is the first of the ways of God; Let his Maker bring His sword near. 







###### 20 



Indeed the [^i]mountains bring him food, And all the animals of the field play there. 







###### 21 



He lies down under the lotus plants, In the hiding place of the reeds and the marsh. 







###### 22 



The lotus plants cover him with [^j]shade; The willows of the brook surround him. 







###### 23 



If a river [^k]rages, he is not alarmed; He is confident, though the Jordan rushes to his mouth. 







###### 24 



Can anyone capture him [^l]when he is on watch, Can anyone pierce _his_ nose with barbs? ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

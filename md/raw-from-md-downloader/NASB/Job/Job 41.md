# Job 41

***








###### 1 



"[^a]Can you drag out [^b]Leviathan with a fishhook, And press down his tongue with a rope? 







###### 2 



Can you put a [^c]rope in his nose, And pierce his jaw with a [^d]hook? 







###### 3 



Will he make many pleas to you, Or will he speak to you gentle words? 







###### 4 



Will he make a covenant with you? Will you take him as a servant forever? 







###### 5 



Will you play with him as with a bird, And tie him down for your young girls? 







###### 6 



Will the [^e]traders bargain for him? Will they divide him among the merchants? 







###### 7 



Can you fill his skin with harpoons, Or his head with fishing spears? 







###### 8 



Lay your hand on him. Remember the battle; [^f]you will not do it again! 







###### 9 



[^g]Behold, [^h]your expectation is false; Will [^i]you be hurled down even at the sight of him? 







###### 10 



No one is so reckless that he dares to stir him; Who then is he who opposes Me? 







###### 11 



Who has been first _to give_ to Me, that I should repay _him_? _Whatever_ is under the entire heaven is Mine. 







###### 12 



"I will not be silent about his limbs, Or his mighty strength, or his graceful frame. 







###### 13 



Who can [^j]strip off his outer covering? Who can [^k]pierce his double [^l]armor? 







###### 14 



Who can open the doors of his face? Around his teeth there is terror. 







###### 15 



_His_ [^m]strong scales are _his_ pride, Locked _as with_ a tight seal. 







###### 16 



One is so close to another That no air can come between them. 







###### 17 



They are joined one to another; They clasp each other and cannot be separated. 







###### 18 



His sneezes flash forth light, And his eyes are like the eye of dawn. 







###### 19 



From his mouth go burning torches; Sparks of fire leap forth. 







###### 20 



From his nostrils smoke goes out As _from_ a boiling pot and _burning_ reeds. 







###### 21 



His breath sets coals aglow, And a flame goes forth from his mouth. 







###### 22 



In his neck dwells strength, And dismay leaps before him. 







###### 23 



The folds of his flesh are joined together, Firm and immovable on him. 







###### 24 



His heart is as firm as a stone, And as firm as a lower millstone. 







###### 25 



When he rises up, the [^n]mighty are afraid; Because of the crashing they are bewildered. 







###### 26 



The sword that reaches him cannot [^o]prevail, Nor the spear, the dart, or the javelin. 







###### 27 



He regards iron as straw, Bronze as rotten wood. 







###### 28 



The [^p]arrow cannot make him flee; Slingstones are turned into stubble for him. 







###### 29 



Clubs are regarded as stubble; He laughs at the rattling of the javelin. 







###### 30 



His underparts are _like_ sharp pieces of pottery; He [^q]spreads out _like_ a threshing sledge on the mud. 







###### 31 



He makes the depths boil like a pot; He makes the sea like a jar of ointment. 







###### 32 



Behind him he illuminates a pathway; One would think the deep to be gray-haired. 







###### 33 



Nothing on [^r]earth is like him, One made without fear. 







###### 34 



[^s]He looks on everything that is high; He is king over all the sons of pride." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

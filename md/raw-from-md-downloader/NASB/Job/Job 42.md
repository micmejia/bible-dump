# Job 42

***








###### 1 



Then Job answered the LORD and said, 







###### 2 



"I know that You can _do_ all things, And that no plan is impossible for You. 







###### 3 



'Who is this who conceals advice without knowledge?' Therefore I have declared that which I did not understand, Things too wonderful for me, which I do not know. 







###### 4 



'Please listen, and I will speak; I will ask You, and You instruct me.' 







###### 5 



I have heard of You by the hearing of the ear; But now my eye sees You; 







###### 6 



Therefore I retract, And I repent, _sitting_ on dust and ashes." ## God Is Displeased with Job's Friends 







###### 7 



It came about after the LORD had spoken these words to Job, that the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, "My wrath is kindled against you and against your two friends, because you have not spoken of Me what is trustworthy, as My servant Job _has_. 







###### 8 



Now therefore, take for yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, and go to My servant Job, and offer up a burnt offering for yourselves, and My servant Job will pray for you. For I will [^a]accept him so as not to do with you _as your_ foolishness _deserves_, because you have not spoken of Me what is trustworthy, as My servant Job _has_." 







###### 9 



So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, _and_ Zophar the Naamathite went and did as the LORD told them; and the LORD [^b]accepted Job. ## God Restores Job's Fortunes 







###### 10 



The LORD also restored the fortunes of Job when he prayed for his friends, and the LORD increased double all that Job had. 







###### 11 



Then all his brothers, all his sisters, and all who had known him before came to him, and they ate bread with him in his house; and they sympathized with him and comforted him for all the adversities that the LORD had brought on him. And each one gave him a [^c]piece of money, and each a ring of gold. 







###### 12 



The LORD blessed the latter _days_ of Job more than his beginning; and he had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand female donkeys. 







###### 13 



He also had seven sons and three daughters. 







###### 14 



He named the first Jemimah, the second Keziah, and the third Keren-happuch. 







###### 15 



In all the land no women were found as beautiful as Job's daughters; and their father gave them inheritances among their brothers. 







###### 16 



After this, Job lived 140 years, and saw his sons and his grandsons, four generations. 







###### 17 



And Job died, an old man and full of days. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

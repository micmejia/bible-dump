# Job 5

***








###### 1 



"Call now, is there anyone who will answer you? And to which of the holy ones will you turn? 







###### 2 



For irritation kills the fool, And jealousy brings death to the simple. 







###### 3 



I have seen the fool taking root, And I cursed his home immediately. 







###### 4 



His sons are far from safety, They are also [^a]oppressed at the gate, And there is no one to save _them_. 







###### 5 



[^b]The hungry devour his harvest And take it to a _place of_ thorns, And the [^c]schemer is eager for their wealth. 







###### 6 



For disaster does not come from the dust, Nor does trouble sprout from the ground, 







###### 7 



For man is born for trouble, As sparks fly upward. 







###### 8 



"But as for me, I would seek God, And I would make my plea before God, 







###### 9 



Who does great and unsearchable things, [^d]Wonders without number. 







###### 10 



He gives rain on the earth, And sends water on the fields, 







###### 11 



So that He sets on high those who are lowly, And those who mourn are lifted to safety. 







###### 12 



He frustrates the schemes of the shrewd, So that their hands cannot attain success. 







###### 13 



He captures the wise by their own cleverness, And the advice of the cunning is quickly thwarted. 







###### 14 



By day they meet with darkness, And grope at noon as in the night. 







###### 15 



But He saves from the sword of their mouth, And the poor from the hand of the strong. 







###### 16 



So the helpless has hope, And injustice has shut its mouth. 







###### 17 



"Behold, happy is the person whom God disciplines, So do not reject the discipline of [^e]the Almighty. 







###### 18 



For He inflicts pain, and [^f]gives relief; He wounds, but His hands _also_ heal. 







###### 19 



In six troubles He will save you; Even in seven, evil will not touch you. 







###### 20 



In famine He will redeem you from death, And in war, from the power of the sword. 







###### 21 



You will be hidden [^g]from the scourge of the tongue, And you will not be afraid of violence when it comes. 







###### 22 



You will laugh at violence and hunger, And you will not be afraid of [^h]wild animals. 







###### 23 



For you will be in league with the stones of the field, And the animals of the field will be at peace with you. 







###### 24 



You will know that your tent is secure, For you will visit your home and [^i]have nothing missing. 







###### 25 



You will also know that your [^j]descendants will be many, And your offspring as the grass of the earth. 







###### 26 



You will come to the grave at a ripe age, Like the stacking of grain in its season. 







###### 27

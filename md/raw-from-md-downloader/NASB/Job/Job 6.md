# Job 6

***








###### 1 



Then Job responded, 







###### 2 



"Oh if only my grief were actually weighed And laid in the balances together with my disaster! 







###### 3 



For then it would be heavier than the sand of the seas; For that reason my words have been rash. 







###### 4 



For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, [^a]My spirit drinks their poison; The terrors of God line up against me. 







###### 5 



Does the wild donkey bray over _his_ grass, Or does the ox low over his feed? 







###### 6 



Can something tasteless be eaten without salt, Or is there any taste in the [^b]juice of an alkanet _plant_? 







###### 7 



My soul refuses to touch _them_; They are like loathsome food to me. 







###### 8 



"Oh, that my request might come to pass, And that God would grant my hope! 







###### 9 



_Oh_, that God would decide to crush me, That He would let loose His hand and cut me off! 







###### 10 



But it is still my comfort, And I rejoice in unsparing pain, That I have not [^c]denied the words of the Holy One. 







###### 11 



What is my strength, that I should wait? And what is my end, that I should [^d]endure? 







###### 12 



Is my strength the strength of stones, Or is my flesh bronze? 







###### 13 



Is it that my help is not within me, And that a good outcome is driven away from me? 







###### 14 



"For the despairing man _there should be_ kindness from his friend; So that he does not abandon the [^e]fear of the Almighty. 







###### 15 



My brothers have acted deceitfully like a [^f]wadi, Like the torrents of [^g]wadis which drain away, 







###### 16 



Which are darkened because of ice, _And_ into which the snow [^h]melts. 







###### 17 



When they dry up, they vanish; When it is hot, they disappear from their place. 







###### 18 



The [^i]paths of their course wind along, They go up into wasteland and perish. 







###### 19 



The caravans of Tema looked, The travelers of Sheba hoped for them. 







###### 20 



They were put to shame, for they had trusted, They came there and were humiliated. 







###### 21 



Indeed, you have now become such, You see terrors and are afraid. 







###### 22 



Have I said, 'Give me _something_,' Or, 'Offer a bribe for me from your wealth,' 







###### 23 



Or, 'Save me from the hand of the enemy,' Or, 'Redeem me from the hand of the tyrants'? 







###### 24 



"Teach me, and I will be silent; And show me how I have done wrong. 







###### 25 



How painful are honest words! But what does your argument prove? 







###### 26 



Do you intend to rebuke _my_ words, When the words of one in despair belong to the wind? 







###### 27 



You would even cast _lots_ for the orphans, And barter over your friend. 







###### 28 



Now please look at me, And _see_ if I am lying to your face. 







###### 29 



Please turn away, let there be no injustice; Turn away, my righteousness is still in it. 







###### 30 



Is there injustice on my tongue? Does my palate not discern disasters? ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

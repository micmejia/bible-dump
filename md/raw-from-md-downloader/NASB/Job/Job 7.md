# Job 7

***








###### 1 



"[^a]Is a person not forced to labor on earth, And _are_ his days not like the days of a hired worker? 







###### 2 



As a slave pants for the shade, And as a hired worker who eagerly waits for his wages, 







###### 3 



So I am allotted worthless months, And nights of trouble are apportioned to me. 







###### 4 



When I lie down, I say, 'When shall I arise?' But the night continues, And I am continually tossing until dawn. 







###### 5 



My flesh is clothed with maggots and a crust of dirt, My skin hardens and [^b]oozes. 







###### 6 



My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, And they come to an end without hope. 







###### 7 



"Remember that my life is a _mere_ breath; My eye will not see goodness again. 







###### 8 



The eye of him who sees me will no _longer_ look at me; Your eyes _will be_ on me, but I will not exist. 







###### 9 



When a cloud vanishes, it is gone; In the same way one who goes down to [^c]Sheol does not come up. 







###### 10 



He will not return to his house again, Nor will his place know about him anymore. 







###### 11 



"Therefore I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit, I will complain in the bitterness of my soul. 







###### 12 



Am I the sea, or the sea monster, That You set a guard over me? 







###### 13 



If I say, 'My couch will comfort me, My bed will [^d]ease my complaint,' 







###### 14 



Then You frighten me with dreams, And terrify me by visions, 







###### 15 



So that my soul would choose suffocation, Death rather than my [^e]pains. 







###### 16 



I [^f]waste away; I will not live forever. Leave me alone, for my days are _only_ a breath. 







###### 17 



What is man that You exalt him, And that You [^g]are concerned about him, 







###### 18 



That You examine him every morning And put him to the test every moment? 







###### 19 



[^h]Will You never turn Your gaze away from me, Nor leave me alone until I swallow my spittle? 







###### 20 



Have I sinned? What have I done to You, Watcher of mankind? Why have You made me Your target, So that I am a burden to myself? 







###### 21 



Why then do You not forgive my wrongdoing And take away my [^i]guilt? For now I will lie down in the dust; And You will search for me, but I will no _longer_ exist." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

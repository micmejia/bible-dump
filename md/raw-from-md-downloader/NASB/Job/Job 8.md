# Job 8

***








###### 1 



Then Bildad the Shuhite responded, 







###### 2 



"How long will you say these things, And the words of your mouth be a mighty wind? 







###### 3 



Does God pervert justice? Or does [^a]the Almighty pervert what is right? 







###### 4 



If your sons sinned against Him, Then He turned them over to the [^b]power of their wrongdoing. 







###### 5 



If you will search for God And implore the compassion of [^c]the Almighty, 







###### 6 



If you are pure and upright, Surely now He will stir Himself for you And restore your righteous [^d]estate. 







###### 7 



Though your beginning was insignificant, Yet your end will increase greatly. 







###### 8 



"Please inquire of past generations, And consider the things searched out by their fathers. 







###### 9 



For we are _only_ of yesterday and know nothing, Because our days on earth are as a shadow. 







###### 10 



Will they not teach you _and_ tell you, And bring forth words from their minds? 







###### 11 



"Can papyrus grow tall without a marsh? Can the rushes grow without water? 







###### 12 



While it is still green _and_ not cut down, Yet it withers before any _other_ [^e]plant. 







###### 13 



So are the paths of all who forget God; And the hope of the godless will perish, 







###### 14 



His confidence is fragile, And his trust is a spider's [^f]web. 







###### 15 



He depends on his house, but it does not stand; He holds on to it, but it does not endure. 







###### 16 



He flourishes before the sun, And his shoots spread out over his garden. 







###### 17 



His roots wrap around a rock pile, He [^g]grasps a house of stones. 







###### 18 



If he is [^h]removed from his place, Then it will deny him, _saying_, 'I never saw you.' 







###### 19 



Behold, this is the joy of His way; And out of the dust others will spring. 







###### 20 



Behold, God will not reject _a person of_ integrity, Nor will He [^i]help evildoers. 







###### 21 



He will yet fill your mouth with laughter, And your lips with joyful shouting. 







###### 22 



Those who hate you will be clothed with shame, And the tent of the wicked will no _longer_ exist." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

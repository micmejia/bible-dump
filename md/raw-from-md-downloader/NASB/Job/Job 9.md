# Job 9

***








###### 1 



Then Job responded, 







###### 2 



"In truth I know that this is so; But how can a person be in the right with God? 







###### 3 



If one wished to dispute with Him, He could not answer Him once in a thousand _times_. 







###### 4 



Wise in heart and mighty in strength, Who has [^a]defied Him [^b]without harm? 







###### 5 



_It is God_ who removes the mountains, and they do not know _how_, When He overturns them in His anger. 







###### 6 



_It is He_ who shakes the earth from its place, And its pillars tremble; 







###### 7 



Who commands the sun [^c]not to shine, And puts a seal on the stars; 







###### 8 



Who alone stretches out the heavens, And [^d]tramples down the waves of the sea; 







###### 9 



Who makes the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, And the [^e]constellations of the south. 







###### 10 



_It is He_ who does great things, [^f]the unfathomable, And wondrous works without number. 







###### 11 



If He were to pass by me, I would not see _Him_; Were He to move past _me_, I would not perceive Him. 







###### 12 



If He were to snatch away, who could restrain Him? Who could say to Him, 'What are You doing?' 







###### 13 



"God will not turn back His anger; Beneath Him the helpers of [^g]Rahab cower. 







###### 14 



How then can I [^h]answer Him, _And_ choose my words [^i]before Him? 







###### 15 



For though I were right, I could not [^j]answer; I would have to implore the mercy of my Judge. 







###### 16 



If I called and He answered me, I could not believe that He was listening to my voice. 







###### 17 



For He bruises me with a storm And multiplies my wounds without cause. 







###### 18 



He will not allow me to get my breath, But He saturates me with bitterness. 







###### 19 



If _it is a matter_ of power, behold, _He is_ the strong one! And if _it is a matter_ of justice, who can summon [^k]Him? 







###### 20 



Though I am righteous, my mouth will condemn me; Though I am guiltless, He will declare me guilty. 







###### 21 



I am guiltless; I do not take notice of myself; I reject my life. 







###### 22 



It is _all_ one; therefore I say, 'He destroys the guiltless and the wicked.' 







###### 23 



If the whip kills suddenly, He mocks the despair of the innocent. 







###### 24 



The earth is handed over to the wicked; He covers the faces of its judges. If _it is_ not _He_, then who is it? 







###### 25 



"Now my days are swifter than a runner; They flee away, they see no good. 







###### 26 



They slip by like reed boats, Like an eagle that swoops on [^l]its prey. 







###### 27 



Though I say, 'I will forget my complaint, I will [^m]put my face in order and be cheerful,' 







###### 28 



I am afraid of all my pains, I know that You will not acquit me. 







###### 29 



I am guilty, Why then should I struggle in vain? 







###### 30 



If I washed myself with snow, And cleansed my hands with lye, 







###### 31 



Then You would plunge me into the pit, And my own clothes would loathe me. 







###### 32 



For _He is_ not a man, as I am, that I may answer Him-- That we may go to [^n]court together! 







###### 33 



There is no arbitrator between us, Who can place his hand upon us both. 







###### 34 



Let Him remove His rod from me, And let not the dread of Him terrify me. 







###### 35 



_Then_ I would speak and not fear Him; But I am not like that in myself. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

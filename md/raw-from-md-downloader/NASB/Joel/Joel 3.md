# Joel 3

***








###### 1 



"[^a]For behold, in those days and at that time, When I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem, 







###### 2 



I will gather all the nations And bring them down to the Valley of [^b]Jehoshaphat. Then I will enter into judgment with them there On behalf of My people and My inheritance, Israel, Whom they have scattered among the nations; And they have divided up My land. 







###### 3 



They have also cast lots for My people, [^c]Traded a boy for a prostitute, And sold a girl for wine so that they may drink. 







###### 4 



Moreover, what are you to Me, Tyre, Sidon, and all the regions of Philistia? Are you repaying Me with retribution? But if you are showing Me _retribution_, swiftly and speedily I will return your retribution on your head! 







###### 5 



Since you have taken My silver and My gold, brought My precious [^d]treasures to your temples, 







###### 6 



and sold the sons of Judah and Jerusalem to the [^e]Greeks in order to remove them far from their territory, 







###### 7 



behold, I am going to stir them up from the place where you have sold them, and return your retribution on your head. 







###### 8 



I will also sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the sons of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans, to a distant nation," for the LORD has spoken. 







###### 9 



Proclaim this among the nations: Prepare for holy war; stir up the warriors! Have all the soldiers come forward, have them come up! 







###### 10 



Beat your plowshares into swords, And your pruning hooks into spears; Let the weak _man_ say, "I am a warrior." 







###### 11 



[^f]Hurry and come, all you surrounding nations, And gather yourselves there. Bring down, LORD, Your warriors. 







###### 12 



Let the nations be awakened And come up to the Valley of [^g]Jehoshaphat, For there I will sit to judge All the surrounding nations. 







###### 13 



Put in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe. Come, tread _the grapes_, for the wine press is full; The vats overflow, for their wickedness is great. 







###### 14 



Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of [^h]decision! For the day of the LORD is near in the valley of [^i]decision. 







###### 15 



The sun and moon have become dark, And the stars have lost their brightness. 







###### 16 



The LORD roars from Zion And utters His voice from Jerusalem, And the heavens and the earth quake. But the LORD is a refuge for His people, And a stronghold for the sons of Israel. 







###### 17 



Then you will know that I am the LORD your God, Dwelling on Zion, My holy mountain. So Jerusalem will be holy, And strangers will no longer pass through it. ## Judah Will Be Blessed 







###### 18 



And on that day The mountains will drip with [^j]sweet wine, And the hills will flow with milk, And all the brooks of Judah will flow with water; And a spring will go out from the house of the LORD And water the Valley of [^k]Shittim. 







###### 19 



Egypt will become a wasteland, And Edom will become a desolate wilderness, Because of the violence [^l]done to the sons of Judah, In whose land they have shed innocent blood. 







###### 20 



But Judah will be inhabited forever, And Jerusalem for all generations. 







###### 21 



And I will avenge their blood _which_ I have not avenged, For the LORD dwells in Zion. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

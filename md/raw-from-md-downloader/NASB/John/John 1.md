# John 1

***








###### 1 



In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 







###### 2 



[^a]He was in the beginning with God. 







###### 3 



All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him [^b]not even one thing came into being that has come into being. 







###### 4 



In Him was life, and the life was the Light of mankind. 







###### 5 



And the Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not [^c]grasp it. ## The Witness John the Baptist 







###### 6 



A man [^d]came, _one_ sent from God, _and_ his name was John. 







###### 7 



[^e]He came [^f]as a witness, to testify about the Light, so that all might believe through him. 







###### 8 



[^g]He was not the Light, but _he came_ to testify about the Light. 







###### 9 



[^h]_This_ was the true Light [^i]that, coming into the world, enlightens every person. 







###### 10 



He was in the world, and the world came into being through Him, and _yet_ the world did not [^j]know Him. 







###### 11 



He came to His [^k]own, and His own people did not [^l]accept Him. 







###### 12 



But [^m]as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, to those who [^n]believe in His name, 







###### 13 



who were [^o]born, not of [^p]blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of a man, but of God. ## The Word Made Flesh 







###### 14 



And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us; and we saw His glory, glory as of the only _Son_ from the Father, full of grace and truth. 







###### 15 



John *testified about Him and called out, saying, "This was He of whom I said, 'He who is coming after me has proved to be [^q]my superior, because He existed before me.'" 







###### 16 



For of His fullness [^r]we have all received, and [^s]grace upon grace. 







###### 17 



For the Law was given through Moses; grace and truth [^t]were realized through Jesus Christ. 







###### 18 



No one has seen God at any time; God the only _Son_, who is in the [^u]arms of the Father, He has [^v]explained _Him_. ## The Testimony of John the Baptist 







###### 19 



This is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites to him from Jerusalem to ask him, "Who are you?" 







###### 20 



And he confessed and did not deny; and _this is what_ he confessed: "I am not the [^w]Christ." 







###### 21 



And _so_ they asked him, "What then? Are you Elijah?" And he *said, "I am not." "Are you the Prophet?" And he answered, "No." 







###### 22 



Then they said to him, "Who are you? _Tell us_, so that we may give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?" 







###### 23 



He said, "I am the voice of one calling [^x]out in the wilderness, 'Make the way of the Lord straight,' as Isaiah the prophet said." 







###### 24 



And _the messengers_ had been sent from the Pharisees. 







###### 25 



They asked him, and said to him, "Why then are you baptizing, if you are not the [^y]Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?" 







###### 26 



John answered them, saying, "I baptize [^z]in water, _but_ among you stands One whom you do not know. 







###### 27 



_It is_ He who comes after me, of whom I am not worthy _even_ to untie the strap of His sandal." 







###### 28 



These things took place in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing _people_. 







###### 29 



The next day he *saw Jesus coming to him, and *said, "Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world! 







###### 30 



This is He in behalf of whom I said, 'After me is coming a Man who has proved to be [^aa]my superior, because He existed before me.' 







###### 31 



And I did not recognize [^ab]Him, but so that He would be revealed to Israel, I came baptizing [^ac]in water." 







###### 32 



And John testified, saying, "I have seen the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and He remained upon Him. 







###### 33 



And I did not recognize [^ad]Him, but He who sent me to baptize [^ae]in water said to me, 'He upon whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining upon Him, this is the One who baptizes [^af]in the Holy Spirit.' 







###### 34 



And I myself have seen, and have testified that this is the [^ag]Son of God." ## Jesus' Public Ministry; First Converts 







###### 35 



Again the next day John was standing [^ah]with two of his disciples, 







###### 36 



and he looked at Jesus as He walked, and *said, "Behold, the Lamb of God!" 







###### 37 



And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. 







###### 38 



And Jesus turned and saw them following, and *said to them, "What are you seeking?" They said to Him, "Rabbi (which translated means Teacher), where are You staying?" 







###### 39 



He *said to them, "Come, and you will see." So they came and saw where He was staying, and they stayed with Him that day; it was about the [^ai]tenth hour. 







###### 40 



One of the two who heard John _speak_, and followed Him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. 







###### 41 



He first *found his own brother Simon and *said to him, "We have found the Messiah" (which translated means [^aj]Christ). 







###### 42 



He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, "You are Simon the son of [^ak]John; you shall be called Cephas" (which is translated [^al]Peter). 







###### 43 



The next day He [^am]decided to go to Galilee, and He *found Philip. And Jesus *said to him, "Follow Me." 







###### 44 



Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. 







###### 45 



Philip *found Nathanael and *said to him, "We have found Him of whom Moses wrote in the Law, and the prophets _also wrote_: Jesus the son of Joseph, from Nazareth!" 







###### 46 



Nathanael said to him, "Can anything good be from Nazareth?" Philip *said to him, "Come and see." 







###### 47 



Jesus saw Nathanael coming to Him, and *said of him, "Here is truly an Israelite, in whom there is no deceit!" 







###### 48 



Nathanael *said to Him, "How do You know me?" Jesus answered and said to him, "Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you." 







###### 49 



Nathanael answered Him, "Rabbi, You are the Son of God; You are the King of Israel!" 







###### 50 



Jesus answered and said to him, "Because I said to you that I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You will see greater things than these." 







###### 51 



And He *said to him, "Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

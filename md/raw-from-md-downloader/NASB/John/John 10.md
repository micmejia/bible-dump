# John 10

***








###### 1 



"Truly, truly I say to you, the one who does not enter by the door into the fold of the sheep, but climbs up some other way, he is a thief and a robber. 







###### 2 



But the one who enters by the door is a shepherd of the sheep. 







###### 3 



To him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep listen to his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. 







###### 4 



When he puts all his own _sheep_ outside, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice. 







###### 5 



However, a stranger they simply will not follow, but will flee from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers." 







###### 6 



Jesus told them this figure of speech, but they did not understand what the things which He was saying to them [^a]meant. 







###### 7 



So Jesus said to them again, "Truly, truly I say to you, I am the door of the sheep. 







###### 8 



All those who came before Me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them. 







###### 9 



I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture. 







###### 10 



The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I came so that they would have life, and [^b]have _it_ abundantly. 







###### 11 



"I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep. 







###### 12 



He who is a hired hand, and not a shepherd, who is not the owner of the sheep, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf snatches them and scatters _the flock_. 







###### 13 



_He flees_ because he is a hired hand and does not care about the sheep. 







###### 14 



I am the good shepherd, and I know My own, and My own know Me, 







###### 15 



just as the Father knows Me and I know the Father; and I lay down My life for the sheep. 







###### 16 



And I have other sheep that are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they will listen to My voice; and they will become one flock, _with_ one shepherd. 







###### 17 



For this reason the Father loves Me, because I lay down My life so that I may take it back. 







###### 18 



No one has taken it away from Me, but I lay it down on My own. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it back. This commandment I received from My Father." 







###### 19 



Dissension occurred again among the Jews because of these words. 







###### 20 



Many of them were saying, "He has a demon and is insane. Why do you listen to Him?" 







###### 21 



Others were saying, "These are not the words of one who is demon-possessed. A demon cannot open the eyes of those who are blind, can it?" ## Jesus Asserts His Deity 







###### 22 



At that time the [^c]Feast of the Dedication took place in Jerusalem; 







###### 23 



it was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple _area_, in the portico of Solomon. 







###### 24 



The Jews then surrounded Him and _began_ saying to Him, "How long [^d]will You keep us in suspense? If You are the [^e]Christ, tell us plainly." 







###### 25 



Jesus answered them, "I told you, and you do not believe; the works that I do in My Father's name, these testify of Me. 







###### 26 



But you do not believe, because you are not of My sheep. 







###### 27 



My sheep listen to My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me; 







###### 28 



and I give them eternal life, and they will never perish; and no one will snatch them out of My hand. 







###### 29 



[^f]My Father, who has given _them_ to Me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch _them_ out of the Father's hand. 







###### 30 



I and the Father are [^g]one." 







###### 31 



The Jews picked up stones again to stone Him. 







###### 32 



Jesus replied to them, "I showed you many good works from the Father; for which of them are you stoning Me?" 







###### 33 



The Jews answered Him, "We are not stoning You for a good work, but for blasphemy; and because You, being a man, make Yourself _out to be_ God." 







###### 34 



Jesus answered them, "Has it not been written in your Law: 'I said, you are gods'? 







###### 35 



If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture cannot be nullified), 







###### 36 



are you saying of Him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, 'You are blaspheming,' because I said, 'I am the Son of God'? 







###### 37 



If I do not do the works of My Father, do not believe Me; 







###### 38 



but if I do _them_, even though you do not believe Me, believe the works, so that you may [^h]know and understand that the Father is in Me, and I in the Father." 







###### 39 



Therefore they were seeking again to arrest Him, and He eluded their grasp. 







###### 40 



And He went away again beyond the Jordan to the place where John was first baptizing, and He stayed there. 







###### 41 



Many came to Him and were saying, "While John performed no sign, yet everything John said about this man was true." 







###### 42 



And many believed in Him there. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

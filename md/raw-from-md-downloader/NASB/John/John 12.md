# John 12

***








###### 1 



Therefore, six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. 







###### 2 



So they made Him a dinner there, and Martha was serving; and Lazarus was one of those reclining _at the table_ with Him. 







###### 3 



Mary then took a [^a]pound of very expensive perfume of pure nard, and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped His feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. 







###### 4 



But Judas Iscariot, one of His disciples, the one who intended to [^b]betray Him, *said, 







###### 5 



"Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred [^c]denarii and _the proceeds_ given to poor _people_?" 







###### 6 



Now he said this, not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief, and as he kept the money box, he used to [^d]steal from what was put into it. 







###### 7 



Therefore Jesus said, "Leave her alone, so that she may keep it [^e]for the day of My burial. 







###### 8 



For you always have the poor with you, but you do not always have Me." 







###### 9 



The large crowd of the Jews then learned that He was there; and they came, not on account of Jesus only, but so that they might also see Lazarus, whom He raised from the dead. 







###### 10 



But the chief priests planned to put Lazarus to death also, 







###### 11 



because on account of him many of the Jews were going away and were believing in Jesus. ## The Triumphal Entry 







###### 12 



On the next day, when the large crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, 







###### 13 



they took the branches of the palm trees and went out to meet Him, and _began_ shouting, "Hosanna! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord, indeed, the King of Israel!" 







###### 14 



Jesus, finding a young donkey, sat on it; as it is written: 







###### 15 



"Do not fear, daughter of Zion; behold, your King is coming, seated on a donkey's colt." 







###### 16 



These things His disciples did not understand at the first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of Him, and that they had done these things for Him. 







###### 17 



So the [^f]people, who were with Him when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead, continued to testify _about Him_. 







###### 18 



For this reason also the [^g]people went to meet Him, because they heard that He had performed this [^h]sign. 







###### 19 



So the Pharisees said [^i]to one another, "You see that you are not accomplishing anything; look, the world has gone after Him!" ## Greeks Seek Jesus 







###### 20 



Now there were some Greeks among those who were going up to worship at the feast; 







###### 21 



these _people_ then came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and were making a request of him, saying, "Sir, we wish to see Jesus." 







###### 22 



Philip *came and *told Andrew; _then_ Andrew and Philip *came and *told Jesus. 







###### 23 



But Jesus *answered them by saying, "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. 







###### 24 



Truly, truly I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. 







###### 25 



The one who loves his [^j]life loses it, and the one who hates his [^k]life in this world will keep it [^l]to eternal life. 







###### 26 



If anyone [^m]serves Me, he must follow Me; and where I am, there My servant will be also; if anyone [^n]serves Me, the Father will honor him. ## Jesus Foretells His Death 







###### 27 



"Now My soul has become troubled; and what am I to say? 'Father, save Me from this hour'? But for this purpose I came to this hour. 







###### 28 



Father, glorify Your name." Then a voice came out of heaven: "I have both glorified _it_, and will glorify _it_ again." 







###### 29 



So the crowd who stood by and heard _it_ were saying that it had thundered; others were saying, "An angel has spoken to Him!" 







###### 30 



Jesus responded and said, "This voice has not come for My sake, but for yours. 







###### 31 



Now judgment is _upon_ this world; now the ruler of this world will be cast out. 







###### 32 



And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all _people_ to Myself." 







###### 33 



Now He was saying this to indicate what kind of death He was going to die. 







###### 34 



The crowd then answered Him, "We have heard from the Law that the [^o]Christ is to remain forever; and how _is it that_ You say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this Son of Man?" 







###### 35 



So Jesus said to them, "For a little while longer the Light is among you. Walk while you have the Light, so that darkness will not overtake you; also, the one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going. 







###### 36 



While you have the Light, believe in the Light, so that you may become sons of Light." These things Jesus proclaimed, and He went away and hid Himself from them. 







###### 37 



But though He had performed so many [^p]signs in their sight, they _still_ were not believing in Him. 







###### 38 



_This happened_ so that the word of Isaiah the prophet which he spoke would be fulfilled: "Lord, who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?" 







###### 39 



For this reason they could not believe, for Isaiah said again, 







###### 40 



"He has blinded their eyes and He hardened their heart, so that they will not see with their eyes and understand with their heart, and [^q]be converted, and _so_ I will _not_ heal them." 







###### 41 



These things Isaiah said because he saw His glory, and he spoke about Him. 







###### 42 



Nevertheless many, even of the rulers, believed in Him, but because of the Pharisees they were not confessing _Him_, so that they would not be excommunicated from the synagogue; 







###### 43 



for they loved the [^r]approval of people rather than the [^s]approval of God. 







###### 44 



Now Jesus cried out and said, "The one who believes in Me, does not believe _only_ in Me, but _also_ in Him who sent Me. 







###### 45 



And the one who sees Me sees Him who sent Me. 







###### 46 



I have come _as_ Light into the world, so that no one who believes in Me will remain in darkness. 







###### 47 



If anyone hears My [^t]teachings and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world. 







###### 48 



The one who rejects Me and does not [^u]accept My [^v]teachings has one who judges him: the word which I spoke. That will judge him on the last day. 







###### 49 



For I did not speak [^w]on My own, but the Father Himself who sent Me has given Me a commandment _as to_ what to say and what to speak. 







###### 50 



And I know that His commandment is eternal life; therefore the things I speak, I speak just as the Father has told Me." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

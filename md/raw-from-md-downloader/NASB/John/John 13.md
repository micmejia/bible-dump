# John 13

***








###### 1 



Now before the Feast of the Passover, Jesus, knowing that His hour had come that He would depart from this world to the Father, having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them [^a]to the end. 







###### 2 



And during supper, the devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, _the son_ of Simon, to betray Him, 







###### 3 



_Jesus_, knowing that the Father had handed all things over to Him, and that He had come forth from God and was going _back_ to God, 







###### 4 



*got up from supper and *laid His outer garments _aside_; and He took a towel and tied it around Himself. ## Jesus Washes the Disciples' Feet 







###### 5 



Then He *poured water into the basin, and began washing the disciples' feet and wiping them with the towel which He had tied around Himself. 







###### 6 



So He *came to Simon Peter. He *said to Him, "Lord, You are washing my feet?" 







###### 7 



Jesus answered and said to him, "What I am doing, you do not realize right now, but you will understand later." 







###### 8 



Peter *said to Him, "Never shall You wash my feet!" Jesus answered him, "If I do not wash you, you have no [^b]place with Me." 







###### 9 



Simon Peter *said to Him, "Lord, _then wash_ not only my feet, but also my hands and my head!" 







###### 10 



Jesus *said to him, "He who has bathed needs only to wash his feet; otherwise he is completely clean. And you are clean--but [^c]not all _of you_." 







###### 11 



For He knew the one who was betraying Him; _it was_ for this reason _that_ He said, "Not all _of you_ are clean." 







###### 12 



Then, when He had washed their feet, and taken His garments and reclined _at the table_ again, He said to them, "Do you know what I have done for you? 







###### 13 



You call Me 'Teacher' and 'Lord'; and [^d]you are correct, for _so_ I am. 







###### 14 



So if I, the Lord and the Teacher, washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet. 







###### 15 



For I gave you an example, so that you also would do just as I did for you. 







###### 16 



Truly, truly I say to you, a slave is not greater than his master, nor _is_ [^e]one who is sent greater than the one who sent him. 







###### 17 



If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them. 







###### 18 



I am not speaking about all of you. I know _the ones_ whom I have chosen; but _this is happening_ so that the Scripture may be fulfilled, 'He who eats My bread has lifted up his heel against Me.' 







###### 19 



From now on I am telling you before _it_ happens, so that when it does happen, you may believe that I am _He_. 







###### 20 



Truly, truly I say to you, the one who [^f]receives anyone I send, [^g]receives Me; and the one who [^h]receives Me [^i]receives Him who sent Me." ## Jesus Predicts His Betrayal 







###### 21 



When Jesus had said these things, He became troubled in spirit, and [^j]testified and said, "Truly, truly I say to you that one of you will [^k]betray Me." 







###### 22 



The disciples _began_ looking at one another, at a loss _to know_ of which one He was speaking. 







###### 23 



Lying back on Jesus' chest was one of His disciples, whom Jesus loved. 







###### 24 



So Simon Peter *nodded to this _disciple_ and *said to him, "Tell _us_ who it is of whom He is speaking." 







###### 25 



He then simply leaned back on Jesus' chest and *said to Him, "Lord, who is it?" 







###### 26 



Jesus then *answered, "That man is the one for whom I shall dip the piece _of bread_ and give it to him." So when He had dipped the piece _of bread_, He *took and *gave _it_ to Judas, _the son_ of Simon Iscariot. 







###### 27 



After [^l]this, Satan then entered him. Therefore Jesus *said to him, "What you are doing, do _it_ quickly." 







###### 28 



Now none of those reclining _at the table_ knew for what purpose He had said this to him. 







###### 29 



For some were assuming, since Judas kept the money box, that Jesus was saying to him, "Buy the things we need for the feast"; or else, that he was to [^m]give something to the poor. 







###### 30 



So after receiving the piece _of bread_, he left immediately; and it was night. 







###### 31 



Therefore when he had left, Jesus *said, "Now [^n]is the Son of Man glorified, and God [^o]is glorified in Him; 







###### 32 



[^p]if God is glorified in Him, God will also glorify Him in Himself, and will glorify Him immediately. 







###### 33 



Little children, I am _still_ with you a little longer. You will look for Me; and just as I said to the [^q]Jews, now I also say to you: 'Where I am going, you cannot come.' 







###### 34 



I am giving you a new commandment, that you love one another; just as I have loved you, that you also love one another. 







###### 35 



By this all _people_ will know that you are My disciples: if you have love for one another." 







###### 36 



Simon Peter *said to Him, "Lord, where are You going?" Jesus answered, "Where I am going, you cannot follow Me now; but you will follow later." 







###### 37 



Peter *said to Him, "Lord, why can I not follow You right now? I will lay down my life for You." 







###### 38 



Jesus *replied, "Will you lay down your life for Me? Truly, truly I say to you, a rooster will not crow until you deny Me three times. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

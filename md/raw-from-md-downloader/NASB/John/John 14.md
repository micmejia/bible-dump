# John 14

***








###### 1 



"Do not let your heart be troubled; [^a]believe in God, believe also in Me. 







###### 2 



In My Father's house are many [^b]rooms; if _that_ were not _so_, [^c]I would have told you, because I am going _there_ to prepare a place for you. 







###### 3 



And if I go and prepare a place for you, I am coming again and will take you to Myself, so that where I am, _there_ you also will be. 







###### 4 



And you know the way where I am going." 







###### 5 



Thomas *said to Him, "Lord, we do not know where You are going; how do we know the way?" 







###### 6 



Jesus *said to him, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me. ## Oneness with the Father 







###### 7 



If you [^d]had known Me, you would have known My Father also; from now on you know Him, and have seen Him." 







###### 8 



Philip *said to Him, "Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us." 







###### 9 



Jesus *said to him, "Have I been with [^e]you for so long a time, and _yet_ [^f]you have not come to know Me, Philip? The one who has seen Me has seen the Father; how _can_ you say, 'Show us the Father'? 







###### 10 



Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on My own, but the Father, as He remains in Me, does His works. 







###### 11 



Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me; otherwise believe because of the works themselves. 







###### 12 



Truly, truly I say to you, the one who believes in Me, the works that I do, he will do also; and greater _works_ than these he will do; because I am going to the Father. 







###### 13 



And whatever you ask in My name, this I will do, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. 







###### 14 



If you ask Me anything in My name, I will do _it_. 







###### 15 



"If you love Me, you will keep My commandments. ## The Holy Spirit 







###### 16 



I will ask the Father, and He will give you another [^g]Helper, so that He may be with you forever; 







###### 17 



_the Helper is_ the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not see Him or know _Him; but_ you know Him because He remains with you and will be in you. 







###### 18 



"I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you. 







###### 19 



[^h]After a little while, the world no longer _is going to_ see Me, but you _are going to_ see Me; because I live, you also will live. 







###### 20 



On that day you will know that I _am_ in My Father, and you _are_ in Me, and I in you. 







###### 21 



The one who has My commandments and keeps them is the one who loves Me; and the one who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and will reveal Myself to him." 







###### 22 



Judas (not Iscariot) *said to Him, "Lord, what has happened that You are going to reveal Yourself to us and not to the world?" 







###### 23 



Jesus answered and said to him, "If anyone loves Me, he will follow My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make _Our_ dwelling with him. 







###### 24 



The one who does not love Me does not follow My words; and the word which you hear is not Mine, but the Father's who sent Me. 







###### 25 



"These things I have spoken to you while remaining with you. 







###### 26 



But the Helper, the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and remind you of all that I said to you. 







###### 27 



Peace I leave you, My peace I give you; not as the world gives, do I give to you. [^i]Do not let your hearts be troubled, nor [^j]fearful. 







###### 28 



You heard that I said to you, 'I am going away, and I am coming to you.' If you loved Me, you would have rejoiced [^k]because I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I. 







###### 29 



And now I have told you before it happens, so that when it happens, you may believe. 







###### 30 



I will not speak much more with you, for the ruler of the world is coming, and he has [^l]nothing in _regard to_ Me, 







###### 31 



but so that the world may know that I love the Father, [^m]I do exactly as the Father commanded Me.

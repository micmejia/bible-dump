# John 15

***








###### 1 



"I am the true vine, and My Father is the vinedresser. 







###### 2 



Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit, He takes away; and every _branch_ that bears fruit, He [^a]prunes it so that it may bear more fruit. 







###### 3 



You are already [^b]clean because of the word which I have spoken to you. 







###### 4 



Remain in Me, [^c]and I in you. Just as the branch cannot bear fruit [^d]of itself [^e]but must remain in the vine, so neither _can_ you unless you remain in Me. 







###### 5 



I am the vine, you are the branches; the one who remains in Me, and I in him [^f]bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing. 







###### 6 



If anyone does not remain in Me, he is thrown away like a branch and dries up; and they gather them and throw them into the fire, and they are burned. 







###### 7 



If you remain in Me, and My words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. 







###### 8 



My Father is glorified by this, that you bear much fruit, and _so_ [^g]prove to be My disciples. 







###### 9 



Just as the Father has loved Me, I also have loved you; remain in My love. 







###### 10 



If you keep My commandments, you will remain in My love; just as I have kept My Father's commandments and remain in His love. 







###### 11 



These things I have spoken to you so that My joy may be in you, and _that_ your joy may be made full. ## Disciples' Relation to Each Other 







###### 12 



"This is My commandment, that you love one another, just as I have loved you. 







###### 13 



Greater love has no one than this, that a person will lay down his life for his friends. 







###### 14 



You are My friends if you do what I command you. 







###### 15 



No longer do I call you slaves, for the slave does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, because all things that I have heard from My Father I have made known to you. 







###### 16 



You did not choose Me but I chose you, and appointed you that you would go and bear fruit, and _that_ your fruit would remain, so that whatever you ask of the Father in My name He may give to you. 







###### 17 



This I command you, that you love one another. ## Disciples' Relation to the World 







###### 18 



"If the world hates you, [^h]you know that it has hated Me before _it hated_ you. 







###### 19 



If you were of the world, the world would love _you as_ its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, because of this the world hates you. 







###### 20 



Remember the word that I said to you, 'A slave is not greater than his master.' If they persecuted Me, they will persecute you as well; if they followed My word, they will follow yours also. 







###### 21 



But all these things they will do to you on account of My name, because they do not know the One who sent Me. 







###### 22 



If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have [^i]sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin. 







###### 23 



The one who hates Me hates My Father also. 







###### 24 



If I had not done among them the works which no one else did, they would not have [^j]sin; but now they have both seen and hated Me and My Father as well. 







###### 25 



But _this has happened_ so that the word that is written in their Law will be fulfilled: 'They hated Me for no reason.' 







###### 26 



"When the [^k]Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, _namely_, the Spirit of truth who comes from the Father, He will testify about Me, 







###### 27 



and [^l]you are testifying as well, because you have been with Me from the beginning. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

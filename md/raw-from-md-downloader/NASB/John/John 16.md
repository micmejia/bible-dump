# John 16

***








###### 1 



"These things I have spoken to you so that you will not [^a]be led into sin. 







###### 2 



They will [^b]ban you from the synagogue, yet an hour is coming for everyone who kills you to think that he is offering a [^c]service to God. 







###### 3 



These things they will do because they have not known the Father nor Me. 







###### 4 



But these things I have spoken to you, so that when their hour comes, you [^d]may remember that I told you of them. However, I did not say these things to you at the beginning, because I was with you. ## The Holy Spirit Promised 







###### 5 



"But now I am going to Him who sent Me; and none of you asks Me, 'Where are You going?' 







###### 6 



But because I have said these things to you, grief has filled your heart. 







###### 7 



But I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I am leaving; for if I do not leave, the [^e]Helper will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you. 







###### 8 



And He, when He comes, will convict the world regarding sin, and righteousness, and judgment: 







###### 9 



regarding sin, because they do not believe in Me; 







###### 10 



and regarding righteousness, because I am going to the Father and you no longer _are going to_ see Me; 







###### 11 



and regarding judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged. 







###### 12 



"I have many more things to say to you, but you cannot bear _them_ at the present time. 







###### 13 



But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all the truth; for He will not speak on His own, but whatever He hears, He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come. 







###### 14 



He will glorify Me, for He will take from Mine and will disclose _it_ to you. 







###### 15 



All things that the Father has are Mine; this is why I said that He takes from Mine and will disclose _it_ to you. ## Jesus' Death and Resurrection Foretold 







###### 16 



"A little while, and you no longer _are going to_ see Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me." 







###### 17 



So some of His disciples said to one another, "What is this that He is telling us, 'A little while, and you are not _going to_ see Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me'; and, 'because I am going to the Father'?" 







###### 18 



So they were saying, "What is this that He says, 'A little while'? We do not know what He is talking _about_." 







###### 19 



Jesus knew that they wanted to question Him, and He said to them, "Are you deliberating together about this, that I said, 'A little while, and you are not _going to_ see Me, and again a little while, and you will see Me'? 







###### 20 



Truly, truly I say to you that you will weep and mourn, but the world will rejoice; you will grieve, but your grief will be turned into joy! 







###### 21 



Whenever a woman is in labor she has [^f]pain, because her hour has come; but when she gives birth to the child, she no longer remembers the anguish because of the joy that a [^g]child has been born into the world. 







###### 22 



Therefore you too have grief now; but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one _is going to_ take your joy away from you. ## Prayer Promises 







###### 23 



And on that day you will not question Me about anything. Truly, truly I say to you, if you ask the Father for anything in My name, He will give it to you. 







###### 24 



Until now you have asked for nothing in My name; ask and you will receive, so that your joy may be made full. 







###### 25 



"These things I have spoken to you in figures of speech; an hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures of speech, but will tell you plainly about the Father. 







###### 26 



On that day you will ask in My name, and I am not saying to you that I will request of the Father on your behalf; 







###### 27 



for the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved Me and have believed that I came forth from the Father. 







###### 28 



I came forth from the Father and have come into the world; again, I am leaving the world and going to the Father." 







###### 29 



His disciples *said, "See, now You are speaking plainly and are not [^h]using any figure of speech. 







###### 30 



Now we know that You know all things, and _that_ You have no need for anyone to question You; this is why we believe that You came forth from God." 







###### 31 



Jesus replied to them, "Do you now believe? 







###### 32 



Behold, an hour is coming, and has _already_ come, for you to be scattered, each to his own _home_, and to leave Me alone; and _yet_ I am not alone, because the Father is with Me. 







###### 33 



These things I have spoken to you so that in Me you may have peace. In the world you have tribulation, but take courage; I have overcome the world." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# John 17

***








###### 1 



Jesus spoke these things; and raising His eyes to heaven, He said, "Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son, so that the Son may glorify You, 







###### 2 



just as You gave Him authority over all [^a]mankind, so that [^b]to all whom You have given Him, He may give eternal life. 







###### 3 



And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent. 







###### 4 



I glorified You on the earth [^c]by accomplishing the work which You have given Me to do. 







###### 5 



And now You, Father, glorify Me together with Yourself, with the glory which I had with You before the world existed. 







###### 6 



"I have revealed Your name to the men whom You gave Me out of the world; they were Yours and You gave them to Me, and they have followed Your word. 







###### 7 



Now they have come to know that everything which You have given Me is from You; 







###### 8 



for the words which You gave Me I have given to them; and they received _them_ and truly understood that I came forth from You, and they believed that You sent Me. 







###### 9 



I ask on their behalf; I do not ask on behalf of the world, but on the behalf of those whom You have given Me, because they are Yours; 







###### 10 



and all things that are Mine are Yours, and Yours are Mine; and I have been glorified in them. 







###### 11 



I am no longer _going to be_ in the world; and _yet_ they themselves are in the world, and I am coming to You. Holy Father, keep them in Your name, _the name_ which You have given Me, so that they may be one just as We _are_. 







###### 12 



While I was with them, I was keeping them in Your name, which You have given Me; and I guarded them, and not one of them perished except the [^d]son of destruction, so that the Scripture would be fulfilled. ## The Disciples in the World 







###### 13 



But now I am coming to You; and these things I speak in the world so that they may have My joy made full in themselves. 







###### 14 



I have given them Your word; and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world. 







###### 15 



I am not asking You to take them out of the world, but to keep them away from [^e]the evil one. 







###### 16 



They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world. 







###### 17 



Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth. 







###### 18 



Just as You sent Me into the world, I also sent them into the world. 







###### 19 



And for their sakes I sanctify Myself, so that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth. 







###### 20 



"I am not asking on behalf of these alone, but also for those who believe in Me through their word, 







###### 21 



that they may all be one; just as You, Father, _are_ in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us, so that the world may [^f]believe that You sent Me. ## Disciples' Future Glory 







###### 22 



The glory which You have given Me I also have given to them, so that they may be one, just as We are one; 







###### 23 



I in them and You in Me, that they may be perfected [^g]in unity, so that the world may [^h]know that You sent Me, and You loved them, just as You loved Me. 







###### 24 



Father, I desire that they also, whom You have given Me, be with Me where I am, so that they may see My glory which You have given Me, for You loved Me before the foundation of the world. 







###### 25 



"Righteous Father, [^i]although the world has not known You, yet I have known You; and these have known that You sent Me; 







###### 26 



and I have made Your name known to them, and will make it known, so that the love with which You loved Me may be in them, and I in them." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# John 18

***








###### 1 



When Jesus had spoken these words, He went away with His disciples across the [^a]ravine of the Kidron, where there was a garden which He entered [^b]with His disciples. 







###### 2 



Now Judas, who was [^c]betraying Him, also knew the place, because Jesus had often met there with His disciples. 







###### 3 



So Judas, having obtained the _Roman_ [^d]cohort and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, *came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons. 







###### 4 



Jesus therefore, knowing all the things that were coming upon Him, came out _into the open_ and *said to them, "Whom are you seeking?" 







###### 5 



They answered Him, "Jesus the Nazarene." He *said to them, "I am _He_." And Judas also, who was betraying Him, was standing with them. 







###### 6 



Now then, when He said to them, "I am _He_," they drew back and fell to the ground. 







###### 7 



He then asked them again, "Whom are you seeking?" And they said, "Jesus the Nazarene." 







###### 8 



Jesus answered, "I told you that I am _He_; so if you are seeking Me, let these _men_ go on their way." 







###### 9 



_This took place_ so that the word which He spoke would be fulfilled: "Of those whom You have given Me I lost not one." 







###### 10 



Then Simon Peter, since he had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's slave, and cut off his right ear; and the slave's name was Malchus. 







###### 11 



So Jesus said to Peter, "Put the sword into the sheath; the cup which the Father has given Me, am I not to drink it?" ## Jesus before the Priests 







###### 12 



So the _Roman_ [^e]cohort, the [^f]commander, and the officers of the Jews arrested Jesus and bound Him, 







###### 13 



and brought Him to Annas first; for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year. 







###### 14 



Now Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jews that it was in their best interest for one man to die in behalf of the people. 







###### 15 



Simon Peter was following Jesus, and _so was_ another disciple. Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and he entered with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest, 







###### 16 



but Peter was standing at the door outside. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the doorkeeper, and brought Peter in. 







###### 17 



Then the slave woman who was the doorkeeper *said to Peter, "You are not also _one_ of this Man's disciples, are you?" He *said, "I am not." 







###### 18 



Now the slaves and the officers were standing _there_, having made a charcoal fire, for it was cold and they were warming themselves; and Peter was also with them, standing and warming himself. 







###### 19 



The high priest then questioned Jesus about His disciples, and about His teaching. 







###### 20 



Jesus answered him, "I have spoken openly to the world; I always taught in [^g]synagogues and in the temple _area_, where all the Jews congregate; and I said nothing in secret. 







###### 21 



Why are you asking Me? Ask those who have heard what I spoke to them. Look: these people know what I said." 







###### 22 



But when He said this, one of the officers, who was standing nearby, struck Jesus, saying, "Is that the way You answer the high priest?" 







###### 23 



Jesus answered him, "If I have spoken wrongly, testify of the wrong; but if rightly, why do you strike Me?" 







###### 24 



So Annas sent Him bound to Caiaphas the high priest. ## Peter's Denial of Jesus 







###### 25 



Now Simon Peter was _still_ standing and warming himself. So they said to him, "You are not _one_ of His disciples as well, are you?" He denied _it_, and said, "I am not." 







###### 26 



One of the slaves of the high priest, who was related to the one whose ear Peter cut off, *said, "Did I not see you in the garden with Him?" 







###### 27 



Peter then denied _it_ again, and immediately a rooster crowed. ## Jesus before Pilate 







###### 28 



Then they *brought Jesus from Caiaphas into the [^h]Praetorium, and it was early; and they themselves did not enter the [^i]Praetorium, so that they would not be defiled, but might eat the Passover. 







###### 29 



Therefore Pilate came out to them and *said, "What accusation are you bringing against this Man?" 







###### 30 



They answered and said to him, "If this Man were not [^j]a criminal, we would not have handed Him over to you." 







###### 31 



So Pilate said to them, "Take Him yourselves, and judge Him according to your law." The Jews said to him, "We are not [^k]permitted to put anyone to death." 







###### 32 



_This happened_ so that the word of Jesus which He said, indicating what kind of death He was going to die, would be fulfilled. 







###### 33 



Therefore Pilate entered the Praetorium again, and summoned Jesus and said to Him, "You are the King of the Jews?" 







###### 34 



Jesus answered, "Are you saying this [^l]on your own, or did others tell you about Me?" 







###### 35 



Pilate answered, "I am not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests handed You over to me; what have You done?" 







###### 36 



Jesus answered, "My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, My servants would be fighting so that I would not be handed over to the Jews; but as it is, My kingdom is not [^m]of this realm." 







###### 37 



Therefore Pilate said to Him, "So You are a king?" Jesus answered, "You say _correctly_ that I am a king. For this _purpose_ I have been born, and for this I have come into the world: to testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens to My voice." 







###### 38 



Pilate *said to Him, "What is truth?" And after saying this, he came out again to the Jews and *said to them, "I find no grounds at all for charges in [^n]His case. 







###### 39 



However, you have a custom that I release one _prisoner_ [^o]for you at the Passover; therefore do you wish that I release [^p]for you the King of the Jews?" 







###### 40 



So they shouted again, saying, "Not this Man, but Barabbas." Now Barabbas was a rebel. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

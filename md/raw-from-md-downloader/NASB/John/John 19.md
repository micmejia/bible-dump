# John 19

***








###### 1 



So Pilate then took Jesus and [^a]had Him flogged. 







###### 2 



And the soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and placed it on His head, and put a purple [^b]cloak on Him; 







###### 3 



and they _repeatedly_ came up to Him and said, "Hail, King of the Jews!" and slapped Him in the face _again and again_. 







###### 4 



And _then_ Pilate came out again and *said to them, "See, I am bringing Him out to you so that you will know that I find no grounds at all for charges in [^c]His case." 







###### 5 



Jesus then came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And _Pilate_ *said to them, "Behold, the Man!" 







###### 6 



So when the chief priests and the officers saw Him, they shouted, saying, "Crucify, crucify!" Pilate *said to them, "Take Him yourselves and crucify _Him_; for I find no grounds for charges in [^d]His case!" 







###### 7 



The Jews answered him, "We have a law, and by that law He ought to die, because He made Himself _out to be_ the Son of God!" 







###### 8 



Therefore when Pilate heard this statement, he was _even_ more afraid; 







###### 9 



and he entered the [^e]Praetorium again and *said to Jesus, "Where are You from?" But Jesus gave him no answer. 







###### 10 



So Pilate *said to Him, "Are you not speaking to me? Do You not know that I have authority to release You, and I have authority to crucify You?" 







###### 11 



Jesus answered him, "You would have no authority [^f]over Me at all, if it had not been given to you from above; for this reason the one who handed Me over to you has _the_ greater sin." 







###### 12 



As a result of this, Pilate [^g]made efforts to release Him; but the Jews shouted, saying, "If you release this Man, you are not a friend of Caesar; everyone who makes himself _out to be_ a king [^h]opposes Caesar!" 







###### 13 



Therefore when Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called [^i]The Pavement--but in [^j]Hebrew, Gabbatha. 







###### 14 



Now it was the day of preparation for the Passover; it was about the [^k]sixth hour. And he *said to the Jews, "Look, your King!" 







###### 15 



So they shouted, "Away with _Him_, away with _Him_, crucify Him!" Pilate *said to them, "Shall I crucify your King?" The chief priests answered, "We have no king except Caesar." ## The Crucifixion 







###### 16 



So he then handed Him over to them to be crucified. 







###### 17 



They took Jesus, therefore, and He went out, [^l]carrying His own cross, to the _place_ called the Place of a Skull, which in [^m]Hebrew is called, Golgotha. 







###### 18 



There they crucified Him, and with Him two other men, one on either side, and Jesus in between. 







###### 19 



Now Pilate also wrote an inscription and put it on the cross. It was written: "JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS." 







###### 20 



Therefore many of the Jews read this inscription, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in [^n]Hebrew, Latin, _and_ in Greek. 







###### 21 



So the chief priests of the Jews were saying to Pilate, "Do not write, 'The King of the Jews'; rather, _write_ that He said, 'I am King of the Jews.'" 







###### 22 



Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written." 







###### 23 



Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took His outer garments and made four parts: a part to each soldier, and the [^o]tunic _also_; but the tunic was seamless, woven [^p]in one piece. 







###### 24 



So they said to one another, "Let's not tear it, but cast lots for it, _to decide_ whose it shall be." _This happened_ so that the Scripture would be fulfilled: "They divided My garments among themselves, and they cast [^q]lots for My clothing." Therefore the soldiers did these things. 







###### 25 



Now beside the cross of Jesus stood His mother, His mother's sister, Mary the _wife_ of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. 







###### 26 



So when Jesus saw His mother, and the disciple whom He loved standing nearby, He *said to His mother, "Woman, behold, your son!" 







###### 27 



Then He *said to the disciple, "Behold, your mother!" And from that hour the disciple took her into his own _household_. 







###### 28 



After this, Jesus, knowing that all things had already been accomplished, in order that the Scripture would be fulfilled, *said, "I am thirsty." 







###### 29 



A jar full of sour wine was standing _there_; so they put a sponge full of the sour wine on _a branch of_ hyssop and brought it _up_ to His mouth. 







###### 30 



Therefore when Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, "It is finished!" And He bowed His head and gave up His spirit. ## Care of the Body of Jesus 







###### 31 



Now then, since it was the day of preparation, to prevent the bodies from remaining on the cross on the Sabbath ([^r]for that Sabbath was a high day), the Jews requested of Pilate that their legs be broken, and _the bodies_ be taken away. 







###### 32 



So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man, and of the other who was crucified with Him; 







###### 33 



but after they came to Jesus, when they saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs. 







###### 34 



Yet one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out. 







###### 35 



And he who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true; and he knows that he is telling the truth, so that you also may believe. 







###### 36 



For these things took place so that the Scripture would be fulfilled: "Not a bone of Him shall be [^s]broken." 







###### 37 



And again another Scripture says, "They will look at Him whom they pierced." 







###### 38 



Now after these things Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but a secret _one_ for fear of the [^t]Jews, requested of Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate granted permission. So he came and took away His body. 







###### 39 



Nicodemus, who had first come to Him by night, also came, bringing a [^u]mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a [^v]hundred litras _weight_. 







###### 40 



So they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen wrappings with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews. 







###### 41 



Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden _was_ a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid. 







###### 42 



Therefore because of the Jewish day of preparation, since the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

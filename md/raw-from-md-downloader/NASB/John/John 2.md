# John 2

***








###### 1 



On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there; 







###### 2 



and both Jesus and His disciples were invited to the wedding. 







###### 3 



When the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus *said to Him, "They have no wine." 







###### 4 



And Jesus *said to her, "[^a]What _business_ do you have with Me, woman? My hour has not yet come." 







###### 5 



His mother *said to the servants, "Whatever He tells you, do it." 







###### 6 



Now there were six stone waterpots standing there for the Jewish custom of purification, containing [^b]two or three measures each. 







###### 7 



Jesus *said to them, "Fill the waterpots with water." So they filled them up to the brim. 







###### 8 



And He *said to them, "Draw _some_ out now and take _it_ to the [^c]headwaiter." And they took _it to him_. 







###### 9 



Now when the headwaiter tasted the water which had become wine, and did not know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the headwaiter *called the groom, 







###### 10 



and *said to him, "Every man serves the good wine first, and when _the guests_ are drunk, _then he serves_ the poorer _wine; but_ you have kept the good wine until now." 







###### 11 



This beginning of _His_ [^d]signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and revealed His glory; and His disciples believed in Him. 







###### 12 



After this He went down to Capernaum, He and His mother, and _His_ brothers and His disciples; and they stayed there a few days. ## First Passover--Cleansing the Temple 







###### 13 



The Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 







###### 14 



And within the temple _grounds_ He found those who were selling oxen, sheep, and doves, and the money changers seated _at their tables_. 







###### 15 



And He made a whip of [^e]cords, and drove _them_ all out of the temple _area_, with the sheep and the oxen; and He poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables; 







###### 16 



and to those who were selling the doves He said, "Take these things away from here; stop making My Father's house a [^f]place of business!" 







###### 17 



His disciples remembered that it was written: "Zeal for Your house will consume me." 







###### 18 



The Jews then said to Him, "What sign do You show us [^g]as your authority for doing these things?" 







###### 19 



Jesus answered them, "Destroy this [^h]temple, and in three days I will raise it up." 







###### 20 



The Jews then said, "It took forty-six years to build this [^i]temple, and _yet_ You will raise it up in three days?" 







###### 21 



But He was speaking about the [^j]temple of His body. 







###### 22 



So when He was raised from the dead, His disciples remembered that He said this; and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken. 







###### 23 



Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in His name as they observed His signs which He was doing. 







###### 24 



But Jesus, on His part, was not entrusting Himself to them, because He knew all people, 







###### 25 



and because He did not need anyone to testify about mankind, for He Himself knew what was in mankind. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# John 20

***








###### 1 



Now on the first _day_ of the week Mary Magdalene *came early to the tomb, while it was still dark, and *saw the stone _already_ removed from the tomb. 







###### 2 



So she *ran and *came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and *said to them, "They have taken the Lord from the tomb, and we do not know where they have put Him." 







###### 3 



So Peter and the other disciple left, and they were going to the tomb. 







###### 4 



The two were running together; and the other disciple ran ahead, faster than Peter, and came to the tomb first; 







###### 5 



and he stooped to look _in_, and *saw the linen wrappings lying _there_; however he did not go in. 







###### 6 



So Simon Peter also *came, following him, and he entered the tomb; and he *looked at the linen wrappings lying _there_, 







###### 7 



and the face-cloth which had been on His head, not lying with the linen wrappings but folded up in a place by itself. 







###### 8 



So the other disciple who had first come to the tomb also entered then, and he saw and believed. 







###### 9 



For they did not yet understand the Scripture, that He must rise from the dead. 







###### 10 



So the disciples went away again to their own _homes_. 







###### 11 



But Mary was standing outside the tomb, weeping; so as she wept, she stooped to look into the tomb; 







###### 12 



and she *saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had been lying. 







###### 13 



And they *said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping?" She *said to them, "Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they put Him." 







###### 14 



When she had said this, she turned around and *saw Jesus standing _there_, and _yet_ she did not know that it was Jesus. 







###### 15 



Jesus *said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?" Thinking that He was the gardener, she *said to Him, "Sir, if you have carried Him away, tell me where you put Him, and I will take Him away." 







###### 16 



Jesus *said to her, "Mary!" She turned and *said to Him in [^a]Hebrew, "Rabboni!" (which means, Teacher). 







###### 17 



Jesus *said to her, "Stop clinging to Me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to My brothers and say to them, 'I am ascending to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God.'" 







###### 18 



Mary Magdalene *came and announced to the disciples, "I have seen the Lord," and _that_ He had said these things to her. ## Jesus among His Disciples 







###### 19 



Now when it was evening on that day, the first _day_ of the week, and when the doors were [^b]shut where the disciples were _together_ due to fear of the [^c]Jews, Jesus came and stood in their midst, and *said to them, "Peace _be_ to you." 







###### 20 



And when He had said this, He showed them both His hands and His side. The disciples then rejoiced when they saw the Lord. 







###### 21 



So Jesus said to them again, "Peace _be_ to you; just as the Father has sent Me, I also send you." 







###### 22 



And when He had said this, He breathed on them and *said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit. 







###### 23 



If you forgive the sins of any, _their sins_ [^d]have been forgiven them; if you retain the _sins_ of any, they have been retained." 







###### 24 



But Thomas, one of the twelve, who was called [^e]Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. 







###### 25 



So the other disciples were saying to him, "We have seen the Lord!" But he said to them, "Unless I see in His hands the imprint of the nails, and put my finger into the place of the nails, and put my hand into His side, I will not believe." 







###### 26 



[^f]Eight days later His disciples were again inside, and Thomas _was_ with them. Jesus *came, the doors having been [^g]shut, and stood in their midst and said, "Peace _be_ to you." 







###### 27 



Then He *said to Thomas, "Place your finger here, and see My hands; and take your hand and put it into My side; and do not continue in disbelief, but _be_ a believer." 







###### 28 



Thomas answered and said to Him, "My Lord and my God!" 







###### 29 



Jesus *said to him, "Because you have seen Me, have you _now_ believed? Blessed _are_ they who did not see, and _yet_ believed." ## Why This Gospel Was Written 







###### 30 



So then, many other [^h]signs Jesus also performed in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book; 







###### 31 



but these have been written so that you may believe that Jesus is the [^i]Christ, the Son of God; and that by believing you may have life in His name. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

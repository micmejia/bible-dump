# John 21

***








###### 1 



After these things Jesus [^a]revealed Himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias, and He revealed _Himself_ in this way: 







###### 2 



Simon Peter, Thomas who was called [^b]Didymus, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the _sons_ of Zebedee, and two others of His disciples were together. 







###### 3 



Simon Peter *said to them, "I am going fishing." They *said to him, "We are also coming with you." They went out and got into the boat; and that night they caught nothing. 







###### 4 



But when the day was now breaking, Jesus stood on the beach; yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. 







###### 5 



So Jesus *said to them, "Children, you do not have any fish to eat, do you?" They answered Him, "No." 







###### 6 



And He said to them, "Cast the net on the right-hand side of the boat, and you will find _the fish_." So they cast _it_, and then they were not able to haul it in because of the great quantity of fish. 







###### 7 



Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved *said to Peter, "It is the Lord!" So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his outer garment (for he was stripped _for work_), and threw himself into the sea. 







###### 8 



But the other disciples came in the little boat, for they were not far from the land, but about [^c]two hundred cubits away, dragging the net _full_ of fish. 







###### 9 



So when they got out on the land, they *saw a charcoal fire _already_ [^d]made and fish placed on it, and bread. 







###### 10 



Jesus *said to them, "Bring some of the fish which you have now caught." 







###### 11 



So Simon Peter went up and hauled the net to land, full of large fish, 153; and although there were so many, the net was not torn. ## Jesus Provides 







###### 12 



Jesus *said to them, "Come _and_ have breakfast." None of the disciples ventured to inquire of Him, "Who are You?" knowing that it was the Lord. 







###### 13 



Jesus *came and *took the bread and *gave _it_ to them, and the fish likewise. 







###### 14 



This was now the third time that Jesus revealed Himself to the disciples, after He was raised from the dead. ## The Love Question 







###### 15 



Now when they had finished breakfast, Jesus *said to Simon Peter, "Simon, _son_ of John, do you [^e]love Me more than these?" He *said to Him, "Yes, Lord; You know that I [^f]love You." He *said to him, "Tend My lambs." 







###### 16 



He *said to him again, a second time, "Simon, _son_ of John, do you [^g]love Me?" He *said to Him, "Yes, Lord; You know that I [^h]love You." He *said to him, "Shepherd My sheep." 







###### 17 



He *said to him the third time, "Simon, _son_ of John, do you [^i]love Me?" Peter was [^j]hurt because He said to him the third time, "Do you [^k]love Me?" And he said to Him, "Lord, You know all things; You know that I [^l]love You." Jesus *said to him, "Tend My sheep. ## Our Times Are in His Hand 







###### 18 



Truly, truly I tell you, when you were younger, you used to put on your belt and walk wherever you wanted; but when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands and someone else will put your belt on you, and bring _you_ where you do not want _to go_." 







###### 19 



Now He said this, indicating by what kind of death he would glorify God. And when He had said this, He *said to him, "Follow Me!" 







###### 20 



Peter turned around and *saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following _them_--the one who also had leaned back on His chest at the supper and said, "Lord, who is the one who is betraying You?" 







###### 21 



So Peter, upon seeing him, *said to Jesus, "Lord, and what _about_ this man?" 







###### 22 



Jesus *said to him, "If I want him to remain until I come, what _is that_ to you? You follow Me!" 







###### 23 



Therefore this [^m]account went out among the brothers, that that disciple would not die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but _only_, "If I want him to remain until I come, what _is that_ to you?" 







###### 24 



This is the disciple who is testifying about these things and wrote these things, and we know that his testimony is true. 







###### 25 



But there are also many other things which Jesus did, which, if they were written in detail, I expect that even the world itself would not contain the books that would be written. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

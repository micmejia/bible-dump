# John 3

***








###### 1 



Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews; 







###### 2 



this man came to [^a]Jesus at night and said to Him, "Rabbi, we know that You have come from God _as_ a teacher; for no one can do these [^b]signs that You do unless God is with him." 







###### 3 



Jesus responded and said to him, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless someone is born [^c]again he cannot see the kingdom of God." 







###### 4 



Nicodemus *said to Him, "How can a person be born when he is old? He cannot enter his mother's womb a second time and be born, can he?" 







###### 5 



Jesus answered, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless someone is born of water and _the_ Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. 







###### 6 



That which has been born of the flesh is flesh, and that which has been born of the Spirit is spirit. 







###### 7 



Do not be amazed that I said to you, 'You must be born [^d]again.' 







###### 8 



The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it is coming from and where it is going; so is everyone who has been born of the Spirit." 







###### 9 



Nicodemus responded and said to Him, "How can these things be?" 







###### 10 



Jesus answered and said to him, "You are the teacher of Israel, and _yet_ you do not understand these things? 







###### 11 



Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know and testify of what we have seen, and you _people_ do not accept our testimony. 







###### 12 



If I told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things? 







###### 13 



No one has ascended into heaven, except He who descended from heaven: the Son of Man. 







###### 14 



And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, 







###### 15 



so that everyone who [^e]believes will have eternal life in Him. 







###### 16 



"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish, but have eternal life. 







###### 17 



For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world, but so that the world might be saved through Him. 







###### 18 



The one who believes in Him is not judged; the one who does not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. 







###### 19 



And this is the judgment, that the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light; for their deeds were evil. 







###### 20 



For everyone who does evil hates the Light, and does not come to the Light, so that his deeds will not be exposed. 







###### 21 



But the one who practices the truth comes to the Light, so that his deeds will be revealed [^f]as having been performed in God." ## John the Baptist's Last Testimony 







###### 22 



After these things Jesus and His disciples came into the land of Judea; and there He was spending time with them and baptizing. 







###### 23 



Now John also was baptizing in Aenon, near Salim, because there was an abundance of water there; and _people_ were coming and being baptized-- 







###### 24 



for John had not yet been thrown into prison. 







###### 25 



Then a matter of dispute developed on the part of John's disciples with a Jew about [^g]purification. 







###### 26 



And they came to John and said to him, "Rabbi, He who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have testified--behold, He is baptizing and all _the people_ are coming to Him." 







###### 27 



John replied, "A person can receive not even one thing unless it has been given to him from heaven. 







###### 28 



You yourselves [^h]are my witnesses that I said, 'I am not the [^i]Christ,' but, 'I have been sent ahead of Him.' 







###### 29 



He who has the bride is the groom; but the friend of the groom, who stands and listens to him, rejoices greatly because of the groom's voice. So this joy of mine has been made full. 







###### 30 



He must [^j]increase, but I must [^k]decrease. 







###### 31 



"He who comes from above is above all; the one who is _only_ from the earth is of the earth and speaks of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all. 







###### 32 



What He has seen and heard, of this He testifies; and no one accepts His testimony. 







###### 33 



The one who has accepted His testimony has certified that God is true. 







###### 34 



For He whom God sent speaks the words of God; for He does not give the Spirit [^l]sparingly. 







###### 35 



The Father loves the Son and has entrusted all things to His hand. 







###### 36 



The one who believes in the Son has eternal life; but the one who does not [^m]obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

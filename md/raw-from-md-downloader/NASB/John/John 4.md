# John 4

***








###### 1 



So then, when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that [^a]He was making and baptizing more disciples than John 







###### 2 



(although Jesus Himself was not baptizing; rather, His disciples _were_), 







###### 3 



He left Judea and went away again to Galilee. 







###### 4 



And He had to pass through Samaria. 







###### 5 



So He *came to a city of Samaria called Sychar, near the parcel of land that Jacob gave to his son Joseph; 







###### 6 



and Jacob's well was there. So Jesus, tired from His journey, was just sitting by the well. It was about [^b]the sixth hour. ## The Woman of Samaria 







###### 7 



A woman of Samaria *came to draw water. Jesus *said to her, "Give Me a drink." 







###### 8 



For His disciples had gone away to the city to buy food. 







###### 9 



So the Samaritan woman *said to Him, "How _is it that_ You, _though_ You are a Jew, are asking me for a drink, _though_ I am a Samaritan woman?" (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.) 







###### 10 



Jesus replied to her, "If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who is saying to you, 'Give Me a drink,' you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water." 







###### 11 



She *said to Him, "[^c]Sir, You have no bucket and the well is deep; where then do You get _this_ living water? 







###### 12 



You are not greater than our father Jacob, are You, who gave us the well and drank of it himself, and his sons and his cattle?" 







###### 13 



Jesus answered and said to her, "Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again; 







###### 14 



but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall never be thirsty; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up to eternal life." 







###### 15 



The woman *said to Him, "[^d]Sir, give me this water so that I will not be thirsty, nor come _all the way_ here to draw _water_." 







###### 16 



He *said to her, "Go, call your husband and come here." 







###### 17 



The woman answered and said to Him, "I have no husband." Jesus *said to her, "You have correctly said, 'I have no husband'; 







###### 18 



for you have had five husbands, and the one whom you now have is not your husband; this _which_ you have said _is_ true." 







###### 19 



The woman *said to Him, "[^e]Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet. 







###### 20 



Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, and _yet_ you _Jews_ say that in Jerusalem is the place where one must worship." 







###### 21 



Jesus *said to her, "Believe Me, woman, that [^f]a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. 







###### 22 



You _Samaritans_ worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, because salvation is from the Jews. 







###### 23 



But [^g]a time is coming, and [^h]even now has arrived, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for such people the Father seeks _to be_ [^i]His worshipers. 







###### 24 



God is [^j]spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth." 







###### 25 



The woman *said to Him, "I know that Messiah is coming (He who is called Christ); when that One comes, He will declare all things to us." 







###### 26 



Jesus *said to her, "I am _He_, the One speaking to you." 







###### 27 



And at this point His disciples came, and they were amazed that He had been speaking with a woman, yet no one said, "What are You seeking?" or, "Why are You speaking with her?" 







###### 28 



So the woman left her waterpot and went into the city, and *said to the people, 







###### 29 



"Come, see a man who told me all the things that I have done; this is not the [^k]Christ, is He?" 







###### 30 



They left the city and were coming to Him. 







###### 31 



Meanwhile the disciples were urging Him, saying, "Rabbi, eat _something_." 







###### 32 



But He said to them, "I have food to eat that you do not know about." 







###### 33 



So the disciples were saying to one another, "No one brought Him _anything_ to eat, did he?" 







###### 34 



Jesus *said to them, "My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me, and to accomplish His work. 







###### 35 



Do you not say, 'There are still four months, and _then_ comes the harvest'? Behold, I tell you, raise your eyes and observe the fields, that they are white for harvest. 







###### 36 



Already the one who reaps is receiving wages and is gathering fruit for eternal life, so that the one who sows and the one who reaps may rejoice together. 







###### 37 



For in this _case_ the saying is true: 'One sows and another reaps.' 







###### 38 



I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored; others have labored, and you have [^l]come into their labor." ## The Samaritans 







###### 39 



Now from that city many of the Samaritans believed in Him because of the word of the woman who testified, "He told me all the things that I have done." 







###### 40 



So when the Samaritans came to [^m]Jesus, they were asking Him to stay with them; and He stayed there two days. 







###### 41 



Many more believed because of His word; 







###### 42 



and they were saying to the woman, "_It is_ no longer because of what you said _that_ we believe, for we have heard for ourselves and know that this One truly is the Savior of the world." 







###### 43 



And after the two days, He departed from there for Galilee. 







###### 44 



For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country. 







###### 45 



So when He came to Galilee, the Galileans received Him, _only because_ they had seen all the things that He did in Jerusalem at the feast; for they themselves also went to the feast. ## Healing an Official's Son 







###### 46 



Therefore He came again to Cana of Galilee, where He had made the water _into_ wine. And there was a royal official whose son was sick at Capernaum. 







###### 47 



When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea into Galilee, he went to Him and _began_ asking _Him_ to come down and heal his son; for he was at the point of death. 







###### 48 



Then Jesus said to him, "Unless you _people_ see [^n]signs and wonders, you _simply_ will not believe." 







###### 49 



The royal official *said to Him, "[^o]Sir, come down before my child dies." 







###### 50 



Jesus *said to him, "Go; your son [^p]is alive." The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went _home_. 







###### 51 



And as he was now going down, his slaves met him, saying that his [^q]son was [^r]alive. 







###### 52 



So he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better. Then they said to him, "Yesterday at the [^s]seventh hour the fever left him." 







###### 53 



So the father knew that _it was_ at that hour in which Jesus said to him, "Your son is alive"; and he himself believed, and his entire household. 







###### 54 



This is again a second [^t]sign that Jesus performed when He had come from Judea into Galilee. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# John 8

***








###### 1 



But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. 







###### 2 



And early in the morning He came again into the temple _area_, and all the people were coming to Him; and He sat down and _began_ teaching them. 







###### 3 



Now the scribes and the Pharisees *brought a woman caught in the act of adultery, and after placing her in the center _of the courtyard_, 







###### 4 



they *said to Him, "Teacher, this woman has been caught in the very act of committing adultery. 







###### 5 



Now in the Law, Moses commanded us to stone such women; what then do You say?" 







###### 6 



Now they were saying this to test Him, so that they might have _grounds for_ accusing Him. But Jesus stooped down and with His finger wrote on the ground. 







###### 7 



When they persisted in asking Him, He straightened up and said to them, "He who is without sin among you, let him _be the_ first to throw a stone at her." 







###### 8 



And again He stooped down and wrote on the ground. 







###### 9 



Now when they heard _this_, they _began_ leaving, one by one, beginning with the older ones, and He was left alone, and the woman _where she_ was, in the center _of the courtyard_. 







###### 10 



And straightening up, Jesus said to her, "Woman, where are they? Did no one condemn you?" 







###### 11 



She said, "No one, [^a]Lord." And Jesus said, "I do not condemn you, either. Go. From now on do not sin any longer."]] ## Jesus Is the Light of the World 







###### 12 



Then Jesus again spoke to them, saying, "I am the Light of the world; the one who follows Me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the Light of life." 







###### 13 



So the Pharisees said to Him, "You are testifying about Yourself; Your testimony is not [^b]true." 







###### 14 



Jesus answered and said to them, "Even if I am testifying about Myself, My testimony is [^c]true, because I know where I came from and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from or where I am going. 







###### 15 



You judge [^d]according to the flesh; I am not judging anyone. 







###### 16 



But even if I do judge, My judgment is true; for I am not alone _in it_, but I and the Father who sent Me. 







###### 17 



Even in your Law it has been written that the testimony of two people is [^e]true. 







###### 18 



I am He who testifies about Myself, and the Father who sent Me testifies about Me." 







###### 19 



So they were saying to Him, "Where is Your Father?" Jesus answered, "You know neither Me nor My Father; if you knew Me, you would know My Father also." 







###### 20 



These words He spoke [^f]in the treasury, as He taught in the temple _area_; and no one arrested Him, because His hour had not yet come. 







###### 21 



Then He said again to them, "I am going away, and you will look for Me, and will die in your sin; where I am going, you cannot come." 







###### 22 



So the Jews were saying, "Surely He will not kill Himself, will He, since He says, 'Where I am going, you cannot come'?" 







###### 23 



And He was saying to them, "You are from below, I am from above; you are of this world, I am not of this world. 







###### 24 



Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins; for unless you believe that [^g]I am, you will die in your sins." 







###### 25 



Then they were saying to Him, "Who are You?" Jesus said to them, "[^h]What have I even been saying to you _from_ the beginning? 







###### 26 



I have many things to say and to judge regarding you, but He who sent Me is true; and the things which I heard from Him, these I say to the world." 







###### 27 



They did not realize that He was speaking to them _about_ the Father. 







###### 28 



So Jesus said, "When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that [^i]I am, and I do nothing [^j]on My own, but I say these things as the Father instructed Me. 







###### 29 



And He who sent Me is with Me; He [^k]has not left Me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to Him." 







###### 30 



As He said these things, many came to believe in Him. ## The Truth Will Set You Free 







###### 31 



So Jesus was saying to those Jews who had believed Him, "If you continue in My word, _then_ you are truly My disciples; 







###### 32 



and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free." 







###### 33 



They answered Him, "We are Abraham's descendants and have never been enslaved to anyone; how _is it that_ You say, 'You will become free'?" 







###### 34 



Jesus answered them, "Truly, truly I say to you, everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin. 







###### 35 



Now the slave does not remain in the house forever; the son does remain forever. 







###### 36 



So if the Son sets you free, you really will be free. 







###### 37 



I know that you are Abraham's descendants; yet you are seeking to kill Me, because My word [^l]has no place in you. 







###### 38 



I speak of the things which I have seen [^m]with _My_ Father; therefore you also do the things which you heard from _your_ father." 







###### 39 



They answered and said to Him, "Abraham is our father." Jesus *said to them, "If you are Abraham's children, do the deeds of Abraham. 







###### 40 



But as it is, you are seeking to kill Me, a man who has told you the truth, which I heard from God; this Abraham did not do. 







###### 41 



You are doing the deeds of your father." They said to Him, "We were not born as a result of sexual immorality; we have one Father: God." 







###### 42 



Jesus said to them, "If God were your Father, you would love Me, for I came forth from God and am here; for I have not even come [^n]on My own, but [^o]He sent Me. 







###### 43 



Why do you not understand [^p]what I am saying? _It is_ because you cannot listen to My word. 







###### 44 



You are of _your_ father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him. Whenever he tells [^q]a lie, he speaks from his own _nature_, because he is a liar and the father of [^r]lies. 







###### 45 



But because I say the truth, you do not believe Me. 







###### 46 



Which one of you convicts Me of sin? If I speak truth, why do you not believe Me? 







###### 47 



The one who is of God hears the words of God; for this reason you do not hear _them_, because you are not of God." 







###### 48 



The Jews answered and said to Him, "Do we not rightly say that You are a Samaritan, and You have a demon?" 







###### 49 



Jesus answered, "I do not have a demon; on the contrary, I honor My Father, and you dishonor Me. 







###### 50 



But I am not seeking My glory; there is One who seeks _it_, and judges. 







###### 51 



Truly, truly I say to you, if anyone follows My word, he will never see death." 







###### 52 



The Jews said to Him, "Now we know that You have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets _as well_; and _yet_ You say, 'If anyone follows My word, he will never taste of death.' 







###### 53 



You are not greater than our father Abraham, who died, are You? The prophets died too. Whom do You make Yourself _out to be_?" 







###### 54 



Jesus answered, "If I glorify Myself, My glory is nothing; it is My Father who glorifies Me, of whom you say, 'He is our God'; 







###### 55 



and you have not come to know Him, but I know Him. And if I say that I do not know Him, I will be a liar like you; but I do know Him, and I follow His word. 







###### 56 



Your father Abraham was overjoyed that he would see My day, and he saw _it_ and rejoiced." 







###### 57 



So the Jews said to Him, "You are not yet fifty years old, and You have seen Abraham?" 







###### 58 



Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly I say to you, before Abraham [^s]was born, [^t]I am." 







###### 59 



Therefore they picked up stones to throw at Him, but Jesus hid Himself and left the temple _grounds_. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# John 9

***








###### 1 



As _Jesus_ passed by, He saw a man _who had been_ blind from birth. 







###### 2 



And His disciples asked Him, "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he would be born blind?" 







###### 3 



Jesus answered, "_It was_ neither _that_ this man sinned, nor his parents; but _it was_ so that the works of God might be displayed in him. 







###### 4 



We must carry out the works of Him who sent Me as long as it is day; night is coming, when no one can work. 







###### 5 



While I am in the world, I am the Light of the world." 







###### 6 



When He had said this, He spit on the ground, and made mud from the saliva, and applied the mud to his eyes, 







###### 7 



and said to him, "Go, wash in the pool of Siloam" (which is translated, Sent). So he left and washed, and came _back_ seeing. 







###### 8 



So the neighbors, and those who previously saw [^a]him as a beggar, were saying, "Is this not the one who used to sit and beg?" 







###### 9 



Others were saying, "This is he," _still_ others were saying, "No, but he is like him." [^b]The man himself kept saying, "I am _the one_." 







###### 10 



So they were saying to him, "How then were your eyes opened?" 







###### 11 



He answered, "The man who is called Jesus made mud, and spread _it_ on my eyes, and said to me, 'Go to Siloam and wash'; so I went away and washed, and I received sight." 







###### 12 



And they said to him, "Where is He?" He *said, "I do not know." ## Controversy over the Man 







###### 13 



They *brought [^c]the man who was previously blind to the Pharisees. 







###### 14 



Now it was a Sabbath on the day that Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes. 







###### 15 



Then the Pharisees also were asking him again how he received his sight. And he said to them, "He applied mud to my eyes, and I washed, and I see." 







###### 16 



Therefore some of the Pharisees were saying, "This man is not from God, because He does not keep the Sabbath." But others were saying, "How can a man who is a sinner perform such [^d]signs?" And there was dissension among them. 







###### 17 



So they *said again to the man who was blind, "What do you say about Him, since He opened your eyes?" And he said, "He is a prophet." 







###### 18 



The Jews then did not believe _it_ about him, that he had been blind and had received sight, until they called the parents of the very one who had received his sight, 







###### 19 



and they questioned them, saying, "Is this your son, who you say was born blind? Then how does he now see?" 







###### 20 



His parents then answered and said, "We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind; 







###### 21 



but how he now sees, we do not know; or who opened his eyes, we do not know. Ask him; he is of age, he will speak for himself." 







###### 22 



His parents said this because they were afraid of the [^e]Jews; for the Jews had already reached the decision that if anyone confessed Him to be [^f]Christ, he was to be excommunicated from the synagogue. 







###### 23 



_It was_ for this reason _that_ his parents said, "He is of age; ask him." 







###### 24 



So for a second time they summoned the man who had been blind, and said to him, "Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner." 







###### 25 



He then answered, "Whether He is a sinner, I do not know; one thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see." 







###### 26 



So they said to him, "What did He do to you? How did He open your eyes?" 







###### 27 



He answered them, "I told you already and you did not listen; why do you want to hear _it_ again? You do not want to become His disciples too, do you?" 







###### 28 



They spoke abusively to him and said, "You are His disciple, but we are disciples of Moses. 







###### 29 



We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where He is from." 







###### 30 



The man answered and said to them, "Well, here is the amazing thing, that you do not know where He is from, and _yet_ He opened my eyes! 







###### 31 



We know that God does not listen to sinners; but if someone is [^g]God-fearing and does His will, He listens to him. 







###### 32 



[^h]Since the beginning of time it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a person born blind. 







###### 33 



If this man were not from God, He could do nothing." 







###### 34 



They answered him, "You were born entirely in sins, and _yet_ you are teaching us?" So they [^i]put him out. ## Jesus Affirms His Deity 







###### 35 



Jesus heard that they had [^j]put him out, and upon finding him, He said, "Do you believe in the Son of Man?" 







###### 36 



He answered [^k]by saying, "And who is He, [^l]Sir, that I may believe in Him?" 







###### 37 



Jesus said to him, "You have both seen Him, and He is the one who is talking with you." 







###### 38 



And he said, "I believe, Lord." And he worshiped Him. 







###### 39 



And Jesus said, "For judgment I came into this world, so that those who do not see may see, and those who see may become blind." 







###### 40 



Those who were with Him from the Pharisees heard these things and said to Him, "We are not blind too, are we?" 







###### 41 



Jesus said to them, "If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now _that_ you maintain, 'We see,' your sin remains. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

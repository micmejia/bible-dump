# Jonah 1

***








###### 1 



The word of the LORD came to Jonah the son of Amittai, saying, 







###### 2 



"Arise, go to Nineveh, the great city, and cry out against it, because their wickedness has come up before Me." 







###### 3 



But Jonah got up to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the LORD. So he went down to Joppa, found a ship that was going to Tarshish, paid the fare, and [^a]boarded it to go with them to Tarshish away from the presence of the LORD. 







###### 4 



However, the LORD hurled a great wind on the sea and there was a great storm on the sea, so that the ship was about to [^b]break up. 







###### 5 



Then the sailors became afraid and every man cried out to his [^c]god, and they hurled the [^d]cargo which was in the ship into the sea to lighten _it_ [^e]for them. But Jonah had gone below into the stern of the ship, had lain down, and fallen sound asleep. 







###### 6 



So the captain approached him and said, "How is it that you are sleeping? Get up, call on your god! Perhaps _your_ god will be concerned about us so that we will not perish." 







###### 7 



And each man said to his mate, "Come, let's cast lots so that we may [^f]find out on whose account this catastrophe _has struck_ us." So they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah. 







###### 8 



Then they said to him, "Tell us, now! On whose account _has_ this catastrophe _struck_ us? What is your occupation, and where do you come from? What is your country, and from what people are you?" 







###### 9 



So he said to them, "I am a Hebrew, and I fear the LORD God of heaven who made the sea and the dry land." 







###### 10 



Then the men became extremely afraid, and they said to him, "[^g]How could you do this?" For the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them. 







###### 11 



So they said to him, "What should we do to you so that the sea will become calm [^h]for us?"--for the sea was becoming increasingly stormy. 







###### 12 



And he said to them, "Pick me up and hurl me into the sea. Then the sea will become calm [^i]for you, because I know that on account of me this great storm _has come_ upon you." 







###### 13 



However, the men [^j]rowed _desperately_ to return to land, but they could not, because the sea was becoming _even_ stormier against them. 







###### 14 



Then they cried out to the LORD and said, "We earnestly pray, O LORD, do not let us perish on account of this man's life, and do not put innocent blood on us; for You, LORD, have done as You pleased." 







###### 15 



So they picked up Jonah and hurled him into the sea, and the sea stopped its raging. 







###### 16 



Then the men became extremely afraid of the LORD, and they offered a sacrifice to the LORD and made vows. 







###### 17 



[^k]And the LORD designated a great fish to swallow Jonah, and Jonah was in the stomach of the fish for three days and three nights. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

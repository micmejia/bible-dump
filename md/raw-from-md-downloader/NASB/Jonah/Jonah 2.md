# Jonah 2

***








###### 1 



[^a]Then Jonah prayed to the LORD his God from the stomach of the fish, 







###### 2 



and he said, "I called out of my distress to the LORD, And He answered me. I called for help from the [^b]depth of Sheol; You heard my voice. 







###### 3 



For You threw me into the deep, Into the heart of the seas, And the current flowed around me. All Your breakers and waves passed over me. 







###### 4 



So I said, 'I have been cast out [^c]of Your sight. Nevertheless I will look again toward Your holy temple.' 







###### 5 



Water encompassed me to the [^d]point of death. The deep flowed around me, Seaweed was wrapped around my head. 







###### 6 



I descended to the base of the mountains. The earth _with_ its bars _was_ around me forever, But You have brought up my life from [^e]the pit, LORD my God. 







###### 7 



While [^f]I was fainting away, I remembered the LORD, And my prayer came to You, Into Your holy temple. 







###### 8 



Those who are followers of worthless [^g]idols Abandon their faithfulness, 







###### 9 



But I will sacrifice to You With a voice of thanksgiving. That which I have vowed I will pay. Salvation is from the LORD." 







###### 10 



Then the LORD commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah up onto the dry land. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

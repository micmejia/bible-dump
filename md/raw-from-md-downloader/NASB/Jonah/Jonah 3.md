# Jonah 3

***








###### 1 



Now the word of the LORD came to Jonah the second time, saying, 







###### 2 



"Arise, go to Nineveh, the great city, and proclaim to it the proclamation which I am going to tell you." 







###### 3 



So Jonah got up and went to Nineveh according to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was [^a]an exceedingly large city, a three days' walk. 







###### 4 



Then Jonah began to go through the city one day's walk; and he cried out and said, "Forty more days, and Nineveh will be overthrown." 







###### 5 



Then the people of Nineveh believed in God; and they called a fast and put on sackcloth, from the greatest to the least of them. 







###### 6 



When the word reached the king of Nineveh, he got up from his throne, removed his robe from himself, covered _himself_ with sackcloth, and sat on the [^b]dust. 







###### 7 



And he issued a proclamation, and it said, "In Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles: No person, animal, herd, or flock is to taste anything. They are not to eat, or drink water. 







###### 8 



But _every_ person and animal must be covered with sackcloth; and _people_ are to call on God vehemently, and they are to turn, each one from his evil way, and from the violence which is in their hands. 







###### 9 



Who knows, God may turn and relent, and turn from His burning anger so that we will not perish." 







###### 10 



When God saw their deeds, that they turned from their evil way, then God relented of the disaster which He had declared He would [^c]bring on them. So He did not do _it_. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

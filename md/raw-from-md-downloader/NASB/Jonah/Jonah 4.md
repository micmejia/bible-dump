# Jonah 4

***








###### 1 



But it greatly displeased Jonah, and he became angry. 







###### 2 



Then he prayed to the LORD and said, "Please LORD, was this not [^a]what I said when I was still in my _own_ country? Therefore in anticipation _of this_ I fled to Tarshish, since I knew that You are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and abundant in mercy, and One who relents of disaster. 







###### 3 



So now, LORD, please take my [^b]life from me, for death is better to me than life." 







###### 4 



But the LORD said, "Do you have a good reason to be angry?" 







###### 5 



Then Jonah left the city and sat down east of [^c]it. There he made a shelter for himself and sat under it in the shade, until he could see what would happen in the city. 







###### 6 



So the LORD God designated a [^d]plant, and it grew up over Jonah to be a shade over his head, to [^e]relieve him of his discomfort. And Jonah [^f]was overjoyed about the plant. 







###### 7 



But God designated a worm when dawn came the next day, and it attacked the plant and it withered. 







###### 8 



And when the sun came up God designated a scorching east wind, and the sun beat down on Jonah's head so that he became faint, and he begged with _all_ his soul to die, saying, "Death is better to me than life!" 







###### 9 



But God said to Jonah, "Do you have a good reason to be angry about the plant?" And he said, "I have good reason to be angry, _even_ to the point of death!" 







###### 10 



Then the LORD said, "You had compassion on the plant, for which you did not work and _which_ you did not cause to grow, which [^g]came up overnight and perished [^h]overnight. 







###### 11 



Should I not also have compassion on Nineveh, the great city in which there are more than 120,000 people, who do not know _the difference_ between their right hand and their left, _as well as_ many animals?" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

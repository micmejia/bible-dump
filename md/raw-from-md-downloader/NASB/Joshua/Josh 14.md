# Joshua 14

***








###### 1 



Now these are _the territories_ which the sons of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers' _households_ of the tribes of the sons of Israel apportioned to them as inheritances, 







###### 2 



by the lot of their inheritance, just as the LORD commanded [^a]through Moses, for the nine tribes and the half-tribe. 







###### 3 



For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe beyond the Jordan; but he did not give an inheritance to the Levites among them. 







###### 4 



For the sons of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim, and they did not give a portion to the Levites in the land, except cities to live in, with their pasture lands for their livestock and for their property. 







###### 5 



The sons of Israel did exactly as the LORD had commanded Moses, and they divided the land. 







###### 6 



Then the sons of Judah approached Joshua in Gilgal, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, "You know the word which the LORD spoke to Moses the man of God on account of [^b]you and me in Kadesh-barnea. 







###### 7 



I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land, and I brought word back to him as _it was_ in my heart. 







###### 8 



Nevertheless my brothers who went up with me made the heart of the people [^c]melt _with fear_; but I followed the LORD my God fully. 







###### 9 



So Moses swore on that day, saying, 'The land on which your foot has walked shall certainly be an inheritance to you and to your children forever, because you have followed the LORD my God fully.' 







###### 10 



And now behold, the LORD has let me live, just as He spoke, these forty-five years, from the time that the LORD spoke this word to Moses, when Israel walked in the wilderness; and now behold, I am eighty-five years old today. 







###### 11 



I am still as strong today as I was on the day Moses sent me; as my strength was then, so my strength is now, for war and for going out and coming in. 







###### 12 



Now then, give me this hill country about which the LORD spoke on that day, for you heard on that day that Anakim _were_ there, with great fortified cities; perhaps the LORD will be with me, and I will [^d]drive them out just as the LORD has spoken." 







###### 13 



So Joshua blessed him and gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh as an inheritance. 







###### 14 



Therefore, Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day, because he followed the LORD God of Israel fully. 







###### 15 



Now the name of Hebron was previously [^e]Kiriath-arba; _for Arba_ was the greatest man among the Anakim. Then the land was at rest from war. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

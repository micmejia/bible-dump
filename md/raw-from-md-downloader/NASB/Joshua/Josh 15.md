# Joshua 15

***








###### 1 



Now the lot for the tribe of the sons of Judah according to their families [^a]reached the border of Edom, southward to the wilderness of Zin at the extreme south. 







###### 2 



Their southern border was from the _lower_ end of the Salt Sea, from the bay that turns to the south. 







###### 3 



Then it proceeded southward to the ascent of Akrabbim and continued to Zin, then went up by the south of Kadesh-barnea and continued to Hezron, and went up to Addar and turned to Karka. 







###### 4 



It continued to Azmon and proceeded to the [^b]brook of Egypt, and the [^c]border ended at the sea. This shall be your southern border. 







###### 5 



The eastern border _was_ the Salt Sea, as far as the [^d]mouth of the Jordan. And the border of the north side was from the bay of the sea at the [^e]mouth of the Jordan. 







###### 6 



Then the border went up to Beth-hoglah, and continued on the north of Beth-arabah, and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben. 







###### 7 



And the border went up to Debir from the Valley of Achor, and turned northward toward Gilgal which is opposite the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south of the valley; and the border continued to the waters of En-shemesh and [^f]it ended at En-rogel. 







###### 8 



Then the border went up the Valley of Ben-hinnom to the slope of the Jebusite on the south (that is, Jerusalem); and the border went up to the top of the mountain which is opposite the Valley of Hinnom to the west, which is at the end of the Valley of Rephaim toward the north. 







###### 9 



And from the top of the mountain the border turned to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah and proceeded to the cities of Mount Ephron, then the border turned to Baalah (that is, Kiriath-jearim). 







###### 10 



The border turned from Baalah westward to Mount Seir, and continued to the slope of Mount Jearim on the north (that is, Chesalon), and went down to Beth-shemesh and continued through Timnah. 







###### 11 



Then the border proceeded to the side of Ekron northward. And the border turned to Shikkeron and continued to Mount Baalah and proceeded to Jabneel, and the [^g]border ended at the sea. 







###### 12 



The western border _was_ at the Great Sea, even _its_ [^h]coastline. This is the border around the sons of Judah according to their families. 







###### 13 



Now he gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh a portion among the sons of Judah, in accordance with the [^i]command of the LORD to Joshua, _namely_, [^j]Kiriath-arba, _Arba being_ the father of Anak (that is, Hebron). 







###### 14 



And Caleb [^k]drove out from there the three sons of Anak: Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak. 







###### 15 



Then he went up from there against the inhabitants of Debir; now the name of Debir previously was Kiriath-sepher. 







###### 16 



And Caleb said, "The one who [^l]attacks Kiriath-sepher and captures it, [^m]I will give him Achsah my daughter as a wife." 







###### 17 



Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, captured it; so he gave him Achsah his daughter as a wife. 







###### 18 



And it happened that when she came _to him_, she incited him to ask her father for a field. So she dismounted from the donkey, and Caleb said to her, "What do you want?" 







###### 19 



Then she said, "Give me a blessing; since you have given me the land of the [^n]Negev, give me springs of water also." So he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs. 







###### 20 



This is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Judah according to their families.

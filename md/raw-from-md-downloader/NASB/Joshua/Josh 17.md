# Joshua 17

***








###### 1 



Now _this_ was the lot for the tribe of Manasseh, for he was the firstborn of Joseph. To Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, [^a]were allotted Gilead and Bashan, because he was a man of war. 







###### 2 



So _the lot_ was _made_ for the rest of the sons of Manasseh according to their families: for the sons of Abiezer, the sons of Helek, the sons of Asriel, the sons of Shechem, the sons of Hepher, and the sons of Shemida; these _were_ the male [^b]descendants of Manasseh the son of Joseph according to their families. 







###### 3 



However, Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, only daughters; and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. 







###### 4 



They approached Eleazar the priest, Joshua the son of Nun, and the leaders, saying, "The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers." So in accordance with the [^c]command of the LORD he gave them an inheritance among their father's brothers. 







###### 5 



So ten portions fell to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is beyond the Jordan, 







###### 6 



because the daughters of Manasseh received an inheritance among his sons. And the land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the sons of Manasseh. 







###### 7 



The border of Manasseh [^d]ran from Asher to Michmethath which was east of Shechem; then the border went [^e]southward to the inhabitants of En-tappuah. 







###### 8 



The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh, but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh _belonged_ to the sons of Ephraim. 







###### 9 



And the border went down to the [^f]brook of Kanah, southward of the [^g]brook (these cities _belonged_ to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh), and the border of Manasseh _was_ on the north side of the [^h]brook, and [^i]it ended at the sea. 







###### 10 



The south side _belonged_ to Ephraim and the north side to Manasseh, and the sea was [^j]their border; and they reached to Asher on the north and to Issachar on the east. 







###### 11 



In Issachar and in Asher, Manasseh had Beth-shean and its towns and Ibleam and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of En-dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns; the third is Napheth. 







###### 12 



But the sons of Manasseh could not take possession of these cities, because the Canaanites persisted in living in this land. 







###### 13 



And it came about when the sons of Israel became strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but they did not [^k]drive them out completely. 







###### 14 



Then the sons of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, "Why have you given me _only_ one lot and one portion as an inheritance, though I am a numerous people whom the LORD has blessed up to this point?" 







###### 15 



And Joshua said to them, "If you are a numerous people, go [^l]up to the forest and clear _a place_ for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim, since the hill country of Ephraim is too narrow for you." 







###### 16 



The sons of Joseph then said, "The hill country is not enough for us, but all the Canaanites who live in the valley land have iron chariots, both those who are in Beth-shean and its towns and those who are in the Valley of Jezreel." 







###### 17 



But Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and Manasseh, saying, "You are a numerous people and have great power; you shall not have one lot _only_, 







###### 18 



but the hill country shall be yours. For though it is a forest, you shall clear it, and to its [^m]farthest borders it shall be yours; for you shall [^n]drive out the Canaanites, even though they have iron chariots _and_ though they are strong." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

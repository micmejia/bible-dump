# Joshua 18

***








###### 1 



Then the whole congregation of the sons of Israel assembled at Shiloh, and set up the tent of meeting there; and the land was subdued before them. 







###### 2 



But there remained among the sons of Israel seven tribes who had not divided their inheritance. 







###### 3 



So Joshua said to the sons of Israel, "How long will you [^a]put off entering to take possession of the land which the LORD, the God of your fathers, has given you? 







###### 4 



Provide for yourselves three men from [^b]each tribe so that I may send them, and that they may arise and walk through the land and write _a description of_ it according to their inheritance; then they shall [^c]return to me. 







###### 5 



And they shall divide it into seven portions; Judah shall stay in its territory on the south, and the house of Joseph shall stay in their territory on the north. 







###### 6 



And you shall write _a description of_ the land in seven divisions, and bring _the description_ here to me. Then I will cast lots for you here before the LORD our God. 







###### 7 



For the Levites have no portion among you, because the priesthood of the LORD is [^d]their inheritance. Gad, Reuben, and the half-tribe of Manasseh also have received their inheritance eastward beyond the Jordan, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them." 







###### 8 



Then the men arose and went, and Joshua commanded those who went to write _a description of_ the land, saying, "Go and walk through the land and write _a description of_ it, and return to me; then I will cast lots for you here before the LORD in Shiloh." 







###### 9 



So the men went and passed through the land, and wrote _a description of_ it by cities in seven divisions in a book; and they came to Joshua at the camp at Shiloh. 







###### 10 



Joshua then cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD, and there Joshua divided the land for the sons of Israel according to their divisions. ## The Territory of Benjamin 







###### 11 



Now the lot of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin came up according to their families, and the territory of their lot [^e]lay between the sons of Judah and the sons of Joseph. 







###### 12 



Their border on the north side was from the Jordan, then the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north, and went up through the hill country westward, and [^f]it ended at the wilderness of Beth-aven. 







###### 13 



Then from there the border continued to Luz, to the side of Luz (that is, Bethel) southward; and the border went down to Ataroth-addar, near the hill which _lies_ on the south of lower Beth-horon. 







###### 14 



And the border changed direction _from there_ and turned around on the west side southward, from the hill which _lies_ opposite Beth-horon southward; and [^g]it ended at Kiriath-baal (that is, Kiriath-jearim), a city of the sons of Judah. This _was_ the west side. 







###### 15 



Then the south side _was_ from the edge of Kiriath-jearim, and the border went westward and went to the fountain of the waters of Nephtoah. 







###### 16 



Then the border went down to the edge of the hill which is [^h]in the Valley of Ben-hinnom, which is in the Valley of Rephaim northward; and it went down to the Valley of Hinnom, to the slope of the Jebusite southward, and went down to En-rogel. 







###### 17 



Then it turned northward and went to En-shemesh, and went to Geliloth, which is opposite the ascent of Adummim, and it went down to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben. 







###### 18 



And it continued to the side in front of the Arabah northward, and went down to the Arabah. 







###### 19 



Then the border continued to the side of Beth-hoglah northward; and the [^i]border ended at the north bay of the Salt Sea, at the south end of the Jordan. This _was_ the southern border. 







###### 20 



Moreover, the Jordan was its border on the east side. This _was_ the inheritance of the sons of Benjamin according to their families, _and_ according to its borders all around. 







###### 21 



Now the cities of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, Beth-hoglah, and Emek-keziz, 







###### 22 



Beth-arabah, Zemaraim, and Bethel, 







###### 23 



Avvim, Parah, and Ophrah, 







###### 24 



Chephar-ammoni, Ophni, and Geba; twelve cities with their villages. 







###### 25 



Gibeon, Ramah, and Beeroth, 







###### 26 



Mizpeh, Chephirah, and Mozah, 







###### 27 



Rekem, Irpeel, and Taralah, 







###### 28 



Zelah, Haeleph, the Jebusite _city_ (that is, Jerusalem), Gibeah, Kiriath; fourteen cities with their villages. This is the inheritance of the sons of Benjamin according to their families. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

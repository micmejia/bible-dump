This _was_ the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Asher according to their families, these cities with their villages. ## Territory of Naphtali 







###### 32 



The sixth lot went to the sons of Naphtali; to the sons of Naphtali according to their families. 







###### 33 



Their border was from Heleph, from the oak in Zaanannim, and Adami-nekeb and Jabneel, as far as Lakkum, and [^l]it ended at the Jordan. 







###### 34

###### 47 



The territory of the sons of Dan proceeded [^o]beyond them; for the sons of Dan went up and fought with Leshem and captured it. Then they struck it with the edge of the sword and took possession of it and [^p]settled in it; and they named [^q]Leshem Dan after the name of their father Dan. 







###### 48 



This _was_ the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages. 







###### 49 



When they finished apportioning the land for inheritance by its borders, the sons of Israel gave an inheritance among them to Joshua the son of Nun. 







###### 50 



In accordance with the [^r]command of the LORD, they gave him the city for which he asked, Timnath-serah in the hill country of Ephraim. So he built the city and [^s]settled in it. 







###### 51 



These are the inheritances which Eleazar the priest, Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers' _households_ of the tribes of the sons of Israel apportioned by lot in Shiloh before the LORD at the doorway of the tent of meeting.

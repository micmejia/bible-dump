# Joshua 24

***








###### 1 



Then Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel at Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, their heads, their judges, and their officers; and they presented themselves before God. 







###### 2 



Joshua said to all the people, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel says: 'From ancient times your fathers lived beyond the _Euphrates_ River, _namely_, Terah, the father of Abraham and the father of Nahor, and they served other gods. 







###### 3 



Then I took your father Abraham from beyond the _Euphrates_ River and led him through all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his [^a]descendants and gave him Isaac. 







###### 4 



To Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau, and to Esau I gave Mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt. 







###### 5 



Then I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt [^b]by what I did in its midst; and afterward I brought you out. 







###### 6 



So I brought your fathers out of Egypt, and you came to the sea; and Egypt pursued your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the [^c]Red Sea. 







###### 7 



But when they cried out to the LORD, He put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them and covered them; and your own eyes saw what I did in Egypt. And you lived in the wilderness for a long time. 







###### 8 



Then I brought you into the land of the Amorites, who lived beyond the Jordan, and they fought with you; but I handed them over to you, and you took possession of their land when I eliminated them before you. 







###### 9 



Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, rose up and fought against Israel, and he sent _messengers_ and summoned Balaam the son of Beor to curse you. 







###### 10 



But I was not willing to listen to Balaam. So he had to bless you, and I saved you from his hand. 







###### 11 



You crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho; and the citizens of Jericho fought against you, _and_ the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Girgashite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite. Therefore I handed them over to you. 







###### 12 



Then I sent the hornet before you and it [^d]drove out the two kings of the Amorites from you--not by your sword nor your bow. 







###### 13 



And I gave you a land on which you had not labored, and cities which you had not built, and you have lived in them; you are eating of vineyards and olive groves which you did not plant.' ## "We Will Serve the LORD" 







###### 14 



"Now, therefore, [^e]fear the LORD and serve Him in sincerity and [^f]truth; and do away with the gods which your fathers served beyond the _Euphrates_ River and in Egypt, and serve the LORD. 







###### 15 



But if it is disagreeable in your sight to serve the LORD, choose for yourselves today whom you will serve: whether the gods which your fathers served, which were beyond the _Euphrates_ River, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living; but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD." 







###### 16 



The people answered and said, "Far be it from us that we would abandon the LORD to serve other gods; 







###### 17 



for the LORD our God is He who brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, from the house of slaves, and did these great signs in our sight and watched over us through all the way in which we went and among all the peoples through whose midst we passed. 







###### 18 



The LORD drove out from before us all the peoples, even the Amorites who lived in the land. We also will serve the LORD, for He is our God." 







###### 19 



Then Joshua said to the people, "You will not be able to serve the LORD, for He is a holy God. He is a jealous God; He will not forgive your wrongdoing or your sins. 







###### 20 



If you abandon the LORD and serve foreign gods, then He will turn and do you harm and destroy you after He has done good to you." 







###### 21 



And the people said to Joshua, "No, but we will serve the LORD." 







###### 22 



So Joshua said to the people, "You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen for yourselves the LORD, to serve Him." And they said, "_We are_ witnesses." 







###### 23 



"Now then, do away with the foreign gods which are in your midst, and incline your hearts to the LORD, the God of Israel." 







###### 24 



And the people said to Joshua, "We will serve the LORD our God and [^g]obey His voice." 







###### 25 



So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and made for them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem. 







###### 26 



And Joshua wrote these words in the Book of the Law of God; and he took a large stone and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of the LORD. 







###### 27 



Then Joshua said to all the people, "Behold, this stone shall be a witness against us, because it has heard all the words of the LORD which He spoke [^h]to us; so it shall be a witness against you, so that you do not deny your God." 







###### 28 



Then Joshua dismissed the people, each to his inheritance. ## Joshua's Death and Burial 







###### 29 



Now it came about after these things that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being 110 years old. 







###### 30 



And they buried him in the territory of his inheritance, in Timnath-serah, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north of Mount Gaash. 







###### 31 



Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders who [^i]survived Joshua, and had known every deed of the LORD which He had done for Israel. 







###### 32 



Now they buried the bones of Joseph, which the sons of Israel brought up from Egypt, at Shechem, in the plot of land which Jacob had bought from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for a hundred [^j]pieces of money; and they became the inheritance of Joseph's sons. 







###### 33 



And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him at Gibeah, _the town_ of his son Phinehas, which was given to him in the hill country of Ephraim. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

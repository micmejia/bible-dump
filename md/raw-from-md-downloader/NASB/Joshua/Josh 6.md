# Joshua 6

***








###### 1 



Now Jericho was tightly shut because of the sons of Israel; no one went out and no one came in. 







###### 2 



But the LORD said to Joshua, "See, I have handed Jericho over to you, with its king _and_ the valiant warriors. 







###### 3 



And you shall march around the city, all the men of war circling the city once. You shall do so for six days. 







###### 4 



Also seven priests shall carry seven trumpets of rams' horns in front of the ark; then on the seventh day you shall march around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets. 







###### 5 



It shall be that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city will fall down [^a]flat, and the people shall go up, everyone [^b]straight ahead." 







###### 6 



So Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said to them, "Take up the ark of the covenant, and have seven priests carry seven trumpets of rams' horns in front of the ark of the LORD." 







###### 7 



Then [^c]he said to the people, "Go forward and march around the city, and the armed men shall go on ahead of the ark of the LORD." 







###### 8 



And it was _so_, that when Joshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the LORD went forward and blew the trumpets; and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them. 







###### 9 



And the armed men went ahead of the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard came after the ark, while they continued to blow the trumpets. 







###### 10 



But Joshua commanded the people, saying, "You shall not shout nor let your voice be heard, nor let a word proceed from your mouth, until the day I tell you, 'Shout!' Then you shall shout!" 







###### 11 



So he had the ark of the LORD [^d]taken around the city, circling _it_ once; then they came into the camp and spent the night in the camp. 







###### 12 



Now Joshua got up early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD. 







###### 13 



Then the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets of rams' horns in front of the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew the trumpets; and the armed men went ahead of them, and the rear guard came after the ark of the LORD, while they continued to blow the trumpets. 







###### 14 



So the second day they marched around the city once and returned to the camp; they did the same for six days. 







###### 15 



Then on the seventh day they got up early at the dawning of the day and marched around the city in the same way seven times; only on that day did they march around the city seven times. 







###### 16 



And at the seventh time, when the priests blew the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, "Shout! For the LORD has given you the city. 







###### 17 



But the city shall be designated for [^e]destruction, it and everything that is in it belongs to the LORD; only Rahab the prostitute [^f]and all who are with her in the house shall live, because she hid the messengers whom we sent. 







###### 18 



But as for you, only keep yourselves from the things designated for destruction, so that you do not covet _them_ and take some of the designated things, and turn the camp of Israel into something designated for destruction and bring disaster on it. 







###### 19 



But all the silver and gold, and articles of bronze and iron are holy to the LORD; they shall go into the treasury of the LORD." 







###### 20 



So the people shouted, and [^g]the priests blew the trumpets; and when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down [^h]flat, so that the people went up into the city, everyone straight [^i]ahead, and they took the city. 







###### 21 



They [^j]utterly destroyed everything in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, sheep, and donkey, with the edge of the sword. 







###### 22 



And Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, "Go into the prostitute's house and bring the woman and all she has out of there, just as you have sworn to her." 







###### 23 



So the young men who were spies went in and brought out Rahab, her father, her mother, her brothers, and all she had; they also brought out all her relatives, and placed them outside the camp of Israel. 







###### 24 



Then they burned the city with fire, and all that was in it. Only the silver and gold, and the articles of bronze and iron, they put into the treasury of the [^k]house of the LORD. 







###### 25 



However, Rahab the prostitute and her father's household and all she had, Joshua [^l]spared; and she has lived in the midst of Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho. 







###### 26 



Then Joshua made them take an oath at that time, saying, "Cursed before the LORD is the man who rises up and builds this city Jericho; with _the loss of_ his firstborn he will lay its foundation, and with _the loss of_ his youngest son he will set up its gates." 







###### 27 



So the LORD was with Joshua, and his fame was in all the land. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Judges 17

***








###### 1 



Now there was a man of the hill country of Ephraim whose name was Micah. 







###### 2 



And he said to his mother, "The 1,100 _pieces_ of silver that were taken from you, about which you uttered a curse and also spoke _it_ in my hearing, behold, the silver is with me; I took it." And his mother said, "Blessed be my son by the LORD." 







###### 3 



He then returned the 1,100 _pieces_ of silver to his mother, and his mother said, "I wholly consecrate the silver from my hand to the LORD for my son to make a carved image and a cast metal image; so now I will return [^a]them to you." 







###### 4 



So when he returned the silver to his mother, his mother took two hundred _pieces_ of silver and gave them to the silversmith, who made [^b]them into a carved image and a cast metal image, and [^c]they were in the house of Micah. 







###### 5 



And the man Micah had a [^d]shrine and he made an ephod and [^e]household idols, and [^f]consecrated one of his sons, so that he might become his priest. 







###### 6 



In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes. 







###### 7 



Now there was a young man from Bethlehem in Judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite; and he was [^g]staying there. 







###### 8 



Then the man left the city, Bethlehem in Judah, to [^h]stay wherever he would find _a place_; and as he made his journey, he came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah. 







###### 9 



Micah said to him, "Where do you come from?" And he said to him, "I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, and I am going to [^i]stay wherever I may find _a place_." 







###### 10 



Micah then said to him, "Stay with me and be a father and a priest to me, and I will give you ten _pieces_ of silver a year, a supply of clothing, and your sustenance." So the Levite went _in_. 







###### 11 



The Levite agreed to live with the man, and the young man became to him like one of his sons. 







###### 12 



So Micah [^j]consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest and [^k]lived in the house of Micah. 







###### 13 



Then Micah said, "Now I know that the LORD will prosper me, because I have a Levite as a priest." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

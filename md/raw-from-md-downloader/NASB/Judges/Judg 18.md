# Judges 18

***








###### 1 



In those days there was no king of Israel; and in those days the tribe of the Danites was seeking an inheritance for themselves to live in, for until that day [^a]an inheritance had not [^b]been allotted to them as a possession among the tribes of Israel. 







###### 2 



So the sons of Dan sent from their family five men out of their whole number, [^c]valiant men from Zorah and Eshtaol, to spy out the land and to explore it; and they said to them, "Go, explore the land." And they came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and stayed overnight there. 







###### 3 



When they were near the house of Micah, they recognized the voice of the young man, the Levite; and they turned aside there and said to him, "Who brought you here? And what are you doing in this _place_? And what do you have here?" 







###### 4 



He said to them, "Micah has done this and that for me, and he has hired me and I have become his priest." 







###### 5 



Then they said to him, "Inquire of God, please, that we may know whether our way on which we are going will be successful." 







###### 6 



And the priest said to them, "Go in peace; your way in which you are going [^d]has the LORD's approval." 







###### 7 



So the five men departed and came to Laish, and saw the people who were in it living in security, in the way of the Sidonians, quiet and unsuspecting; for there was no [^e]oppressive ruler humiliating _them_ for anything in the land, and they were far from the Sidonians and had no dealings with anyone. 







###### 8 



When they came back to their brothers at Zorah and Eshtaol, their brothers said to them, "What _do_ you _say_?" 







###### 9 



And they said, "Arise, and let's go up against them; for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very good. And will you [^f]sit still? Do not hesitate to go, to enter, to take possession of the land. 







###### 10 



When you enter, you will come to an unsuspecting people with a spacious land; for God has handed it over to you, a place where there is no lack of anything that is on the earth." 







###### 11 



Then from the family of the Danites, from Zorah and from Eshtaol, six hundred men armed with weapons of war set out. 







###### 12 



They went up and camped at Kiriath-jearim in Judah. Therefore they called that place [^g]Mahaneh-dan to this day; behold, it is [^h]west of Kiriath-jearim. 







###### 13 



And they passed from there to the hill country of Ephraim and came to the house of Micah. ## Danites Take Micah's Idols 







###### 14 



Then the five men who went to spy out the country of Laish [^i]said to their kinsmen, "Do you know that there are in these houses an ephod and [^j]household idols, and a carved image and a cast metal image? Now then, consider what you should do." 







###### 15 



So they turned aside there and came to the house of the young man, the Levite, to the house of Micah, and asked [^k]him how he was doing. 







###### 16 



Meanwhile, the six hundred men armed with their weapons of war, who were of the sons of Dan, were positioned at the entrance of the gate. 







###### 17 



Now the five men who went to spy out the land went up _and_ entered there; they took the carved image, the ephod, the [^l]household idols, and the cast metal image, while the priest was standing at the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men armed with weapons of war. 







###### 18 



When these _men_ entered Micah's house and took the carved image, the ephod, [^m]household idols, and the cast metal image, the priest said to them, "What are you doing?" 







###### 19 



And they said to him, "Be silent, put your hand over your mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest. Is it better for you to be a priest to the house of one man, or to be priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?" 







###### 20 



The priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, the [^n]household idols, and the carved image, and went among the people. 







###### 21 



Then they turned and left, and put the children, the livestock, and the valuables in front of them. 







###### 22 



When they had distanced themselves from Micah's house, the men who _were_ in the houses near Micah's house assembled by command and overtook the sons of Dan. 







###### 23 



Then they called out to the sons of Dan, who turned [^o]around and said to Micah, "What is _the matter_ with you, that you have assembled together?" 







###### 24 



And he said, "You have taken my gods which I made, and the priest, and have gone away; what more do I have? So how can you say to me, 'What is _the matter_ with you?'" 







###### 25 



Then the sons of Dan said to him, "Do not let your voice be heard among us, or else [^p]fierce men will attack you, and you will [^q]lose your life and the lives of your household." 







###### 26 



So the sons of Dan went on their way; and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his house. 







###### 27 



Then they took what Micah had made and the priest who had belonged to him, and came to Laish, to a people quiet and unsuspecting, and struck them with the edge of the sword; and they burned the city with fire. 







###### 28 



And there was no one to save _them_, because it was far from Sidon and they had no dealings with anyone, and it was in the valley which is near Beth-rehob. So they rebuilt the city and lived in it. 







###### 29 



And they named the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father who was born to Israel; however, the name of the city was previously Laish. 







###### 30 



The sons of Dan set up for themselves the carved image; and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of [^r]Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land. 







###### 31 



So they set up for themselves Micah's carved image which he had made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Lamentations 3

***








###### 1 



I am the man who has seen misery Because of the rod of His wrath. 







###### 2 



He has driven me and made me walk In darkness and not in light. 







###### 3 



Indeed, He has turned His hand against me Repeatedly all the day. 







###### 4 



He has consumed my flesh and my skin, He has broken my bones. 







###### 5 



He has [^a]besieged and surrounded me with [^b]bitterness and hardship. 







###### 6 



He has made me live in dark places, Like those who have long been dead. 







###### 7 



He has walled me in so that I cannot go out; He has made my [^c]chain heavy. 







###### 8 



Even when I cry out and call for help, He shuts out my prayer. 







###### 9 



He has blocked my ways with cut stone; He has twisted my paths. 







###### 10 



He is to me _like_ a bear lying in wait, _Like_ a lion in secret places. 







###### 11 



He has made my ways deviate, and torn me to pieces; He has made me desolate. 







###### 12 



He bent His bow And took aim at me as a target for the arrow. 







###### 13 



He made the [^d]arrows of His quiver Enter my [^e]inward parts. 







###### 14 



I have become a laughingstock to all my people, Their song of ridicule all the day. 







###### 15 



He has filled me with bitterness, He has made me drink plenty of wormwood. 







###### 16 



He has also made my teeth grind with gravel; He has made me cower in the dust. 







###### 17 



My soul has been excluded from peace; I have forgotten [^f]happiness. 







###### 18 



So I say, "My [^g]strength has failed, And _so has_ my hope from the LORD." ## Hope of Relief in God's Mercy 







###### 19 



Remember my misery and my homelessness, the wormwood and [^h]bitterness. 







###### 20 



My soul certainly remembers, And [^i]is bent over within me. 







###### 21 



I recall this to my mind, Therefore I [^j]wait. 







###### 22 



[^k]The LORD's acts of mercy indeed do not end, For His compassions do not fail. 







###### 23 



_They_ are new every morning; Great is Your faithfulness. 







###### 24 



"The LORD is my portion," says my soul, "Therefore I [^l]wait for Him." 







###### 25 



The LORD is good to those who [^m]await Him, To the [^n]person _who_ seeks Him. 







###### 26 



_It is_ good that he waits silently For the salvation of the LORD. 







###### 27 



_It is_ good for a man to bear The yoke in his youth. 







###### 28 



Let him sit alone and keep quiet, Since He has laid _it_ on him. 







###### 29 



Let him [^o]put his mouth in the dust; Perhaps there is hope. 







###### 30 



Let him give _his_ cheek to the one who is going to strike him; Let him be filled with shame. 







###### 31 



For the Lord will not reject forever, 







###### 32 



For if He causes grief, Then He will have compassion In proportion to His abundant mercy. 







###### 33 



For He does not [^p]afflict [^q]willingly Or [^r]grieve the sons of mankind. 







###### 34 



To crush under [^s]one's feet All the prisoners of the [^t]land, 







###### 35 



To [^u]deprive a man of justice In the presence of the Most High, 







###### 36 



To [^v]defraud someone in his lawsuit-- _Of these things_ the Lord does not [^w]approve. 







###### 37 



Who is [^x]there who speaks and it comes to pass, Unless the Lord has commanded _it_? 







###### 38 



_Is it_ not from the mouth of the Most High That [^y]both adversity and good proceed? 







###### 39 



Of what can _any_ living [^z]mortal, _or any_ man, Complain [^aa]in view of his sins? 







###### 40 



Let's examine and search out our ways, And let's return to the LORD. 







###### 41 



We raise our heart [^ab]and hands Toward God in heaven; 







###### 42 



We have done wrong and rebelled; You have not pardoned. 







###### 43 



You have covered _Yourself_ with anger And pursued us; You have slain _and_ have not spared. 







###### 44 



You have veiled Yourself with a cloud So that no prayer can pass through. 







###### 45 



You have made us _mere_ refuse and rubbish In the midst of the peoples. 







###### 46 



All our enemies have opened their mouths against us. 







###### 47 



Panic and pitfall have come upon us, Devastation and destruction; 







###### 48 



My [^ac]eyes run down _with_ streams of water Because of the destruction of the daughter of my people. 







###### 49 



My eyes flow unceasingly, Without stopping, 







###### 50 



Until the LORD looks down And sees from heaven. 







###### 51 



My eyes bring pain to my soul Because of all the daughters of my city. 







###### 52 



My enemies without reason Hunted me down like a bird; 







###### 53 



They have silenced [^ad]me in the pit And have [^ae]thrown stones on me. 







###### 54 



Waters flowed over my head; I said, "I am [^af]cut off!" 







###### 55 



I called on Your name, LORD, Out of the lowest pit. 







###### 56 



You have heard my voice, "Do not cover Your ear from my _plea for_ relief, From my cry for help." 







###### 57 



You came near on the day I called to You; You said, "Do not fear!" 







###### 58 



Lord, You have pleaded my soul's cause; You have redeemed my life. 







###### 59 



LORD, You have seen my oppression; Judge my case. 







###### 60 



You have seen all their vengeance, All their schemes against me. 







###### 61 



You have heard their reproach, LORD, All their schemes against me. 







###### 62 



The lips of my assailants and their talk _Are_ against me all day long. 







###### 63 



Look at their [^ag]sitting and their rising; I am their mocking song. 







###### 64 



You will repay them, LORD, In accordance with the work of their hands. 







###### 65 



You will give them [^ah]shamelessness of heart, Your curse will be on them. 







###### 66 



You will pursue them in anger and eliminate them From under the heavens of the LORD! ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

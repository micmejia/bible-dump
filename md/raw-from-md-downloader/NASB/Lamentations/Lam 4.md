# Lamentations 4

***








###### 1 



How dark the gold has become, _How_ the pure gold has changed! The sacred stones are spilled out At the [^a]corner of every street. 







###### 2 



The precious sons of Zion, Weighed against pure gold, How they are regarded as earthenware jars, The work of a potter's hands! 







###### 3 



Even jackals offer the breast, They nurse their young; _But_ the daughter of my people has proved herself cruel, Like ostriches in the wilderness. 







###### 4 



The tongue of the infant clings To the roof of its mouth because of thirst; The children ask for bread, _But_ no one breaks _it_ for them. 







###### 5 



Those who used to eat delicacies Are made to tremble in the streets; Those who were raised in crimson _clothing_ Embrace garbage heaps. 







###### 6 



For the [^b]wrongdoing of the daughter of my people Is greater than the [^c]sin of Sodom, Which was overthrown as in a moment, [^d]And no hands were turned toward her. 







###### 7 



Her [^e]consecrated ones were purer than snow, They shined more than milk; They were more ruddy _in_ [^f]body than pearls of coral, Their form _was like_ [^g]lapis lazuli. 







###### 8 



Their appearance is darker than soot, They are not recognized in the streets; Their skin is shriveled on their bones, It is dry, it has become like wood. 







###### 9 



Better _off_ are those killed by the sword Than those killed by hunger; For they [^h]waste away, [^i]stricken By the lack of the produce of the field. 







###### 10 



The hands of compassionate women Boiled their own children; They became food for them Due to the destruction of the daughter of my people. 







###### 11 



The LORD has expended His wrath, He has poured out His fierce anger; And He has kindled a fire in Zion, And it has consumed its foundations. 







###### 12 



The kings of the earth did not believe, Nor _did_ any of the inhabitants of the world, That the adversary and the enemy Would enter the gates of Jerusalem. 







###### 13 



Because of the sins of her prophets _And_ the wrongdoings of her priests, Who have shed in her midst The blood of the righteous, 







###### 14 



They wandered, blind, in the streets; They were defiled with blood, Such that no one could touch their garments. 







###### 15 



"Keep away! Unclean!" [^j]they cried out of themselves. "Keep away, keep away, do not touch!" For they distanced themselves as well as wandered; _People_ among the nations said, "They shall not continue to reside _with us_." 







###### 16 



The presence of the LORD has scattered them, He will not continue to look at them; They did not [^k]honor the priests, They did not favor the elders. 







###### 17 



Yet our eyes failed, _Looking_ for [^l]help was useless; At our observation point we have watched For a nation that could not save. 







###### 18 



They hunted our steps So that we could not walk in our streets; Our end drew near, Our days were [^m]finished For our end had come. 







###### 19 



Our pursuers were swifter Than the eagles of the sky; They chased us on the mountains, They waited in ambush for us in the wilderness. 







###### 20 



The breath of our nostrils, the LORD's anointed, Was captured in their pits, Of whom we had said, "[^n]In his shadow We shall live among the nations." 







###### 21 



Rejoice and be joyful, daughter of Edom, Who lives in the land of Uz; _But_ the cup will pass to you as well, You will become drunk and expose yourself. 







###### 22 



_The punishment_ of your wrongdoing has been completed, daughter of Zion; He will no longer exile you. _But_ He will punish your wrongdoing, daughter of Edom; He will expose your sins! ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

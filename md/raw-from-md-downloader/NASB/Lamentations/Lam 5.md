# Lamentations 5

***








###### 1 



Remember, LORD, what has come upon us; Look, and see our disgrace! 







###### 2 



Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, Our houses to foreigners. 







###### 3 



We have become orphans, without a father; Our mothers are like widows. 







###### 4 



[^a]We have to pay for our drinking water, Our wood comes _to us_ at a price. 







###### 5 



[^b]Our pursuers are at our necks; We are worn out, we are given no rest. 







###### 6 



We have [^c]submitted to Egypt _and_ Assyria [^d]to get enough bread. 







###### 7 



Our fathers sinned, _and_ are gone; _It is_ we _who_ have been burdened with the punishment for their wrongdoings. 







###### 8 



Slaves rule over us; There is no one to rescue us from their hand. 







###### 9 



We get our bread [^e]at the risk of our lives Because of the sword in the wilderness. 







###### 10 



Our skin has become as hot as an oven, Because of the ravages of hunger. 







###### 11 



They violated the women in Zion, The virgins in the cities of Judah. 







###### 12 



Leaders were hung by their hands; [^f]Elders were not respected. 







###### 13 



Young men [^g]worked at the grinding mill, And youths staggered under _loads_ of wood. 







###### 14 



Elders are absent from the gate, Young men from their music. 







###### 15 



The joy of our hearts has ended; Our dancing has been turned into mourning. 







###### 16 



The crown has fallen from our head; Woe to us, for we have sinned! 







###### 17 



Because of this our heart is faint, Because of these things our eyes are dim; 







###### 18 



Because of Mount Zion which lies desolate, Jackals prowl in it. 







###### 19 



You, LORD, [^h]rule forever; Your throne is from generation to generation. 







###### 20 



Why will You forget us forever? _Why_ do You abandon us for [^i]so long? 







###### 21 



Restore us to You, LORD, so that we may be restored; Renew our days as of old, 







###### 22

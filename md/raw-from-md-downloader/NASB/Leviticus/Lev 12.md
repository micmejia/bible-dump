# Leviticus 12

***








###### 1 



Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 







###### 2 



"Speak to the sons of Israel, saying: 'When a woman gives birth and delivers a male _child_, then she shall be unclean for seven days; as _she is_ in the days of her menstruation, she shall be unclean. 







###### 3 



Then on the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised. 







###### 4 



And she shall stay _at home_ in _her condition of_ [^a]blood purification for thirty-three days; she shall not touch any consecrated thing, nor enter the sanctuary until the days of her purification are completed. 







###### 5 



But if she gives birth to a female _child_, then she shall be unclean for two weeks, as in her menstruation; and she shall stay _at home_ in _her condition of_ [^b]blood purification for sixty-six days. 







###### 6 



'When the days of her purification are completed, for a son or for a daughter, she shall bring to the priest at the doorway of the tent of meeting a one-year-old lamb as a burnt offering and a young pigeon or a turtledove as a [^c]sin offering. 







###### 7 



Then he shall offer it before the LORD and make atonement for her, and she shall be cleansed from the [^d]flow of her blood. This is the law for her who gives birth to _a child, whether_ a male or a female. 







###### 8 



But if [^e]she cannot afford a lamb, then she shall take two turtledoves or two young doves, the one as a burnt offering and the other as a [^f]sin offering; and the priest shall make atonement for her, and she will be clean.'" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Leviticus 17

***








###### 1 



Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 







###### 2 



"Speak to Aaron and to his sons and to all the sons of Israel, and say to them, 'This is what the LORD has commanded, saying, 







###### 3 



"Anyone from the house of Israel who slaughters an ox, a lamb, or a goat in the camp, or slaughters it outside the camp, 







###### 4 



and has not brought it to the doorway of the tent of meeting to present _it_ as an offering to the LORD in front of the [^a]tabernacle of the LORD, bloodshed is to be counted against that person. He has shed blood, and that person shall be cut off from among his people. 







###### 5 



_This shall be done_ so that the sons of Israel will bring their sacrifices which they were sacrificing [^b]in the open field--so that they will bring them to the LORD at the doorway of the tent of meeting to the priest, and sacrifice them as sacrifices of peace offerings to the LORD. 







###### 6 



The priest shall sprinkle the blood on the altar of the LORD at the doorway of the tent of meeting, and offer up the fat in smoke as a soothing aroma to the LORD. 







###### 7 



And they shall no longer offer their sacrifices to the [^c]goat demons with which they play the prostitute. This shall be a permanent statute to them throughout their generations."' 







###### 8 



"Then you shall say to them, 'Anyone from the house of Israel, or from the strangers who reside among them, who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice, 







###### 9 



and does not bring it to the doorway of the tent of meeting to [^d]offer it to the LORD, that person also shall be cut off from his people. 







###### 10 



'And anyone from the house of Israel, or from the strangers who reside among them, who eats any blood, I will set My face against that person who eats the blood, and will cut him off from among his people. 







###### 11 



For the [^e]life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you on the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is the blood by reason of the [^f]life that makes atonement.' 







###### 12 



Therefore I said to the sons of Israel, 'No person among you may eat blood, nor may any stranger who resides among you eat blood.' 







###### 13 



So when anyone from the sons of Israel, or from the strangers who reside among them, [^g]while hunting catches an animal or a bird which may be eaten, he shall pour out its blood and cover it with dirt. 







###### 14 



"For _as for the_ [^h]life of all flesh, its blood is _identified_ with its [^i]life. Therefore I said to the sons of Israel, 'You are not to eat the blood of any flesh, for the [^j]life of all flesh is its blood; whoever eats it shall be cut off.' 







###### 15 



And any person who eats an animal which dies or is torn _by animals_, whether he is a native or a stranger, shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and remain unclean until evening; then he will become clean. 







###### 16 



But if he does not wash _his clothes_ and bathe his body, then he shall bear _the responsibility for_ his [^k]guilt." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

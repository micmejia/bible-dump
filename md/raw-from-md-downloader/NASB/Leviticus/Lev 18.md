# Leviticus 18

***








###### 1 



Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 







###### 2 



"Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, 'I am the LORD your God. 







###### 3 



You shall not do [^a]what is done in the land of Egypt where you lived, nor are you to do [^b]what is done in the land of Canaan where I am bringing you; you shall not walk in their statutes. 







###### 4 



You are to perform My judgments and keep My statutes, [^c]to live in accord with them; I am the LORD your God. 







###### 5 



So you shall keep My statutes and My judgments, which, _if_ [^d]a person [^e]follows them, then he will live by them; I am the LORD. 







###### 6 



'None _of you_ shall approach any blood relative [^f]of his to uncover nakedness; I am the LORD. 







###### 7 



You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father, that is, the nakedness of your mother. She is your mother; you are not to uncover her nakedness. 







###### 8 



You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's wife; it is your father's nakedness. 







###### 9 



_As for_ the nakedness of your sister, _either_ your father's daughter or your mother's daughter, _whether_ born in the household or born outside _the household_, you shall not uncover their nakedness. 







###### 10 



The nakedness of your son's daughter or your daughter's daughter, their nakedness you shall not uncover; for [^g]their nakedness is yours. 







###### 11 



The nakedness of your father's wife's daughter, born to your father, she is your sister; you shall not uncover her nakedness. 







###### 12 



You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's sister; she is your father's blood relative. 







###### 13 



You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother's sister, for she is your mother's blood relative. 







###### 14 



You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's brother. You shall not approach his wife; she is your aunt. 







###### 15 



You shall not uncover the nakedness of your daughter-in-law. She is your son's wife; you shall not uncover her nakedness. 







###### 16 



You shall not uncover the nakedness of your brother's wife; it is your brother's nakedness. 







###### 17 



You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and of her daughter, nor shall you take her son's daughter or her daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness; they are blood relatives. It is an outrageous sin. 







###### 18 



And you shall not [^h]marry a woman in addition to her sister [^i]as a second wife while she is alive, to uncover her nakedness. 







###### 19 



'Also you shall not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness during her menstrual impurity. 







###### 20 



And you shall not have sexual intercourse with your neighbor's wife, to be defiled with her. 







###### 21 



You shall not give any of your children to [^j]offer them to Molech, nor shall you profane the name of your God; I am the LORD. 







###### 22 



You shall not sleep with a male as [^k]one sleeps with a female; it is an abomination. 







###### 23 



Also you shall not have sexual intercourse with any animal to be defiled with it, nor shall any woman stand before an animal to [^l]mate with it; it is a perversion. 







###### 24 



'Do not defile yourselves by any of these things; for by all these things the nations which I am driving out from you have become defiled. 







###### 25 



For the land has become defiled, therefore I have brought its punishment upon it, so the land has vomited out its inhabitants. 







###### 26 



But as for you, you are to keep My statutes and My judgments, and you shall not do any of these abominations, _neither_ the native, nor the stranger who resides among you 







###### 27 



(for the people of the land who were _there_ before you did all these abominations, and the land has become defiled), 







###### 28 



so that the land will not vomit you out should you defile it, as it has vomited out the nation which was _there_ before you. 







###### 29 



For whoever does any of these abominations, those persons who do _so_ shall be cut off from among their people. 







###### 30 



So you are to keep your [^m]commitment to Me not to practice any of the abominable customs which have been practiced before you, so that you do not defile yourselves with them; I am the LORD your God.'" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

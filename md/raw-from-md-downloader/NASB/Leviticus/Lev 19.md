# Leviticus 19

***








###### 1 



Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying: 







###### 2 



"Speak to all the congregation of the sons of Israel and say to them, 'You shall be holy, for I the LORD your God am holy. 







###### 3 



Every one of you shall revere his mother and his father, and you shall keep My Sabbaths; I am the LORD your God. 







###### 4 



Do not turn to idols or make for yourselves cast metal gods; I am the LORD your God. 







###### 5 



'Now when you offer a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD, you shall offer it so that you may be accepted. 







###### 6 



It shall be eaten on the same day you offer _it_, and on the next day; but what remains until the third day shall be burned with fire. 







###### 7 



So if it is eaten at all on the third day, it is unclean; it will not be accepted. 







###### 8 



And everyone who eats it will bear _the consequences for_ his guilt, because he has profaned the holy thing of the LORD; and that person shall be cut off from his people. ## Various Laws 







###### 9 



'Now when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not reap to the very edges of your field, nor shall you gather the gleanings of your harvest. 







###### 10 



And you shall not glean your vineyard, nor shall you gather the fallen grapes of your vineyard; you shall leave them for the needy and for the stranger. I am the LORD your God. 







###### 11 



'You shall not steal, nor deal falsely, nor lie to one another. 







###### 12 



And you shall not swear falsely by My name, so as to profane the name of your God; I am the LORD. 







###### 13 



'You shall not oppress your neighbor, nor rob _him_. The wages of a hired worker are not to remain with you all night until morning. 







###### 14 



You shall not curse a person who is deaf, nor put a stumbling block before a person who is blind, but you shall revere your God; I am the LORD. 







###### 15 



'You shall not do injustice in judgment; you shall not show partiality to the poor nor give preference to the great, but you are to judge your neighbor fairly. 







###### 16 



You shall not go about as a slanderer among your people; _and_ you are not to [^a]jeopardize the [^b]life of your neighbor. I am the LORD. 







###### 17 



'You shall not hate your fellow countryman in your heart; you may certainly rebuke your neighbor, but you are not to incur sin because of him. 







###### 18 



You shall not take vengeance, nor hold any grudge against the sons of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself; I am the LORD. 







###### 19 



'You are to keep My statutes. You shall not cross-breed two kinds of your cattle; you shall not sow your field with two kinds of seed, nor wear a garment of two kinds of material mixed together. 







###### 20 



'Now if a man has sexual relations with a woman who is a slave acquired for _another_ man, but who has in no way been redeemed nor given her freedom, there shall be punishment; they shall not, _however_, be put to death, because she was not free. 







###### 21 



He shall bring his guilt offering to the LORD to the doorway of the tent of meeting, a ram as a guilt offering. 







###### 22 



The priest shall also make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering before the LORD for his sin which he has committed, and the sin which he has committed will be forgiven him. 







###### 23 



'Now when you enter the land and plant all kinds of trees for food, then you shall count their fruit as [^c]forbidden. For three years it shall be [^d]forbidden to you; _it_ shall not be eaten. 







###### 24 



And in the fourth year all its fruit shall be holy, an offering of praise to the LORD. 







###### 25 



But in the fifth year you shall eat its fruit, so that its yield may increase for you; I am the LORD your God. 







###### 26 



'You shall not eat _any meat_ with the blood. You shall not practice divination nor soothsaying. 







###### 27 



You shall not round off the [^e]hairline of your heads, nor trim the edges of your beard. 







###### 28 



You shall not make any cuts in your [^f]body for the [^g]dead, nor make any tattoo marks on yourselves: I am the LORD. 







###### 29 



'Do not profane your daughter by making her a prostitute, so that the land does not fall into prostitution, and the land _does not_ become full of outrageous sin. 







###### 30 



You shall keep My Sabbaths and revere My sanctuary; I am the LORD. 







###### 31 



'Do not turn to [^h]mediums or spiritists; do not seek them out to be defiled by them. I am the LORD your God. 







###### 32 



'You shall stand up in the presence of the grayheaded and honor [^i]elders, and you shall [^j]fear your God; I am the LORD. 







###### 33 



'When a stranger resides with you in your land, you shall not [^k]do him wrong. 







###### 34 



The stranger who resides with you shall be to you as the native among you, and you shall love him as yourself, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt; I am the LORD your God. 







###### 35 



'You shall do no wrong in judgment, in measurement of weight, or volume. 







###### 36 



You shall have accurate balances, accurate weights, an accurate [^l]ephah, and an accurate [^m]hin; I am the LORD your God, who brought you out from the land of Egypt. 







###### 37 



So you shall keep all My statutes and all My ordinances, and do them; I am the LORD.'" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

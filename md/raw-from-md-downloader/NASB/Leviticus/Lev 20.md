# Leviticus 20

***








###### 1 



Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 







###### 2 



"You shall also say to the sons of Israel: 'Anyone from the sons of Israel or from the strangers residing in Israel who gives any of his [^a]children to Molech, shall certainly be put to death; the people of the land shall stone him with stones. 







###### 3 



I will also set My face against that man and will cut him off from among his people, because he has given some of his [^b]children to Molech, so as to defile My sanctuary and to profane My holy name. 







###### 4 



If the people of the land, however, [^c]should ever disregard that man when he gives any of his [^d]children to Molech, so as not to put him to death, 







###### 5 



then I Myself will set My face against that man and against his family, and I will cut off from among their people both him and all those who play the prostitute with him, by playing the prostitute with Molech. 







###### 6 



'As for the person who turns to [^e]mediums and to spiritists, to play the prostitute with them, I will also set My face against that person and will cut him off from among his people. 







###### 7 



You shall consecrate yourselves therefore and be holy, for I am the LORD your God. 







###### 8 



So you shall keep My statutes and practice them; I am the LORD who sanctifies you. 







###### 9 



'If _there is_ anyone who curses his father or his mother, he shall certainly be put to death. He has cursed his father or his mother, _and has brought_ his [^f]own death upon himself. 







###### 10 



'If _there is_ a man who commits adultery with another man's wife, one who commits adultery with his friend's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress must be put to death. 







###### 11 



If _there is_ a man who sleeps with his father's wife, he has uncovered his father's nakedness. Both of them must be put to death, _they have brought_ their [^g]own deaths upon themselves. 







###### 12 



If _there is_ a man who sleeps with his daughter-in-law, both of them must be put to death. They have committed [^h]incest, _and have brought_ their [^i]own deaths upon themselves. 







###### 13 



If _there is_ a man who sleeps with a male as those who sleep with a woman, both of them have committed a detestable act; they must be put to death. _They have brought_ their [^j]own deaths upon themselves. 







###### 14 



If _there is_ a man who [^k]marries a woman and her mother, it is an outrageous sin; both he and they shall be burned with fire, so that there will be no _such_ outrageous sin in your midst. 







###### 15 



If _there is_ a man who has sexual intercourse with an animal, he must be put to death; you shall also kill the animal. 







###### 16 



If _there is_ a woman who approaches any animal to [^l]mate with it, you shall kill the woman and the animal; they must be put to death. _They have brought_ their [^m]own deaths upon themselves. 







###### 17 



'If _there is_ a man who takes his sister, his father's daughter or his mother's daughter, so that he sees her nakedness and she sees his nakedness, it is a disgrace; and they shall be cut off in the sight of the sons of their people. He has uncovered his sister's nakedness; he bears his guilt. 







###### 18 



If _there is_ a man who sleeps with a menstruous woman and uncovers her nakedness, he has exposed her flow, and she has uncovered the flow of her blood; so both of them shall be cut off from among their people. 







###### 19 



You shall also not uncover the nakedness of your mother's sister or of your father's sister, for _such a one_ has uncovered his [^n]blood relative; they will bear their guilt. 







###### 20 



If _there is_ a man who sleeps with his uncle's wife, he has uncovered his uncle's nakedness; they will bear their sin. They will die childless. 







###### 21 



If _there is_ a man who takes his brother's wife, it is [^o]detestable; he has uncovered his brother's nakedness. They will be childless. 







###### 22 



'You are therefore to keep all My statutes and all My ordinances, and do them, so that the land to which I am bringing you to [^p]live will not vomit you out. 







###### 23 



Furthermore, you shall not [^q]follow the customs of the nation which I am going to drive out before you, because they did all these things; therefore I have felt disgust for them. 







###### 24 



So I have said to you, "You are to take possession of their land, and I Myself will give it to you to possess, a land flowing with milk and honey." I am the LORD your God, who has singled you out from the peoples. 







###### 25 



You are therefore to make a distinction between the clean animal and the unclean, and between the unclean bird and the clean; and you shall not make [^r]yourselves detestable by animal or by bird, or by anything [^s]that crawls on the ground, which I have distinguished for you as unclean. 







###### 26 



So you are to be holy to Me, for I the LORD am holy; and I have singled you out from the peoples to be Mine. 







###### 27 



'Now a man or a woman who is a medium or a spiritist [^t]must be put to death. They shall be stoned with stones; _they have brought_ their [^u]own deaths upon themselves.'" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Leviticus 21

***








###### 1 



Then the LORD said to Moses, "Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron, and say to them: 'No one shall defile himself for a _dead_ person among his people, 







###### 2 



except for his relatives who are nearest to him, his mother, his father, his son, his daughter, and his brother, 







###### 3 



also for his virgin sister who is near to him [^a]because she has not had a husband; for her, he may defile himself. 







###### 4 



He shall not defile himself as a [^b]relative by marriage among his people, so as to profane himself. 







###### 5 



They shall not shave any area on their heads bald, nor shave off the edges of their beards, nor make any cuts in their flesh. 







###### 6 



They shall be holy to their God and not profane the name of their God, because they present the offerings by fire [^c]to the LORD, the food of their God; so they shall be holy. 







###### 7 



They shall not take a woman who is a prostitute and [^d]profaned, nor shall they take a woman divorced from her husband; for he is holy to his God. 







###### 8 



You shall consecrate him, therefore, because he offers the food of your God. He shall be holy to you; for I the LORD, who sanctifies you, am holy. 







###### 9 



Also the daughter of any priest, if she profanes herself by prostitution, she profanes her father; she shall be burned with fire. 







###### 10 



'The priest who is [^e]highest among his brothers, on whose head the anointing oil has been poured and [^f]who has been consecrated to wear the garments, shall not [^g]uncover his head nor tear his clothes; 







###### 11 



nor shall he approach any dead person, nor defile himself _even_ for his father or his mother; 







###### 12 



nor shall he leave the sanctuary nor profane the sanctuary of his God, for the consecration of the anointing oil of his God is on him; I am the LORD. 







###### 13 



He shall take a wife in her virginity. 







###### 14 



A widow, or a divorced woman, or one who is profaned by prostitution, these he shall not take; but rather he is to [^h]marry a virgin of his own people, 







###### 15 



so that he will not profane his [^i]children among his people; for I am the LORD who sanctifies him.'" 







###### 16 



Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 







###### 17 



"Speak to Aaron, saying, 'None of your [^j]descendants throughout their generations who has an impairment shall approach to offer the food of his God. 







###### 18 



For no one who has an impairment shall approach: a man who is blind, or one who limps, or one who has a slit nose, or one with _any_ conspicuous feature, 







###### 19 



or someone who has a broken foot or broken hand, 







###### 20 



or a contorted back, or _one who is_ a dwarf, or _has_ a spot in his eye, or a festering rash or scabs, or crushed testicles. 







###### 21 



No man among the [^k]descendants of Aaron the priest who has an impairment is to come forward to offer the LORD's offerings by fire; _since_ he has an impairment, he shall not come forward to offer the food of his God. 







###### 22 



He may eat the food of his God, _both_ of the most holy and of the holy, 







###### 23 



only he shall not come up to the veil or approach the altar, since he has an impairment, so that he does not profane My sanctuaries. For I am the LORD who sanctifies them.'" 







###### 24 



So Moses spoke to Aaron and to his sons and to all the sons of Israel. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

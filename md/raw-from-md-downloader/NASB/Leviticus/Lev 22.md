# Leviticus 22

***








###### 1 



Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 







###### 2 



"Tell Aaron and his sons to be careful with the holy _gifts_ of the sons of Israel, which they dedicate to Me, so as not to profane My holy name; I am the LORD. 







###### 3 



Say to them, 'Any man among all your [^a]descendants throughout your generations who approaches the holy _gifts_ which the sons of Israel consecrate to the LORD, while he has an uncleanness, that person shall be cut off from My presence; I am the LORD. 







###### 4 



No man of the [^b]descendants of Aaron, who has [^c]leprosy or has a discharge, may eat of the holy _gifts_ until he is clean. And one who touches anything made unclean by a corpse, or a man who has a seminal emission, 







###### 5 



or a man who touches any swarming things by which he is made unclean, or _touches_ any person by whom he is made unclean, whatever his uncleanness; 







###### 6 



a [^d]person who touches any such thing shall be unclean until evening, and shall not eat of the holy _gifts_ unless he has bathed his [^e]body in water. 







###### 7 



But when the sun sets, he will be clean, and afterward he may eat of the holy _gifts_, for it is his [^f]food. 







###### 8 



He shall not eat _an animal_ which dies or is torn _by animals_, becoming unclean by it; I am the LORD. 







###### 9 



They shall therefore perform _their_ duty to Me, so that they do not bear sin because of it and die by it because they profane it; I am the LORD who sanctifies them. 







###### 10 



'No [^g]layman, however, is to eat the holy _gift_; a foreign resident with the priest or a hired worker shall not eat the holy _gift_. 







###### 11 



But if a priest buys a [^h]slave as _his_ property with his money, [^i]that person may eat of it, and those who are born in his house may eat of his [^j]food. 







###### 12 



If a priest's daughter is married to a [^k]layman, she shall not eat of the [^l]offering of the holy _gifts_. 







###### 13 



But if a priest's daughter becomes a widow or divorced, and has no child and returns to her father's house as in her youth, she may eat of her father's [^m]food; but no [^n]layman shall eat of it. 







###### 14 



If, however, someone eats a holy _food_ unintentionally, then he shall add to it a fifth of it and shall give the holy _food_ to the priest. 







###### 15 



And they shall not profane the holy _gifts_ of the sons of Israel, which they offer to the LORD, 







###### 16 



and _thereby_ bring upon them [^o]punishment for guilt by eating their holy _gifts_; for I am the LORD who sanctifies them.'" ## Flawless Animals for Sacrifice 







###### 17 



Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 







###### 18 



"Speak to Aaron and to his sons, and to all the sons of Israel, and say to them, 'Anyone of the house of Israel or of the strangers in Israel who presents his offering, whether it is any of their [^p]vows or any of their [^q]voluntary offerings, which they present to the LORD as a burnt offering-- 







###### 19 



for you to be accepted--_it must be_ a male without defect [^r]from the cattle, the sheep, or the goats. 







###### 20 



Whatever has a defect, you shall not offer, for it will not be accepted for you. 







###### 21 



When someone offers a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD to fulfill a special vow or for a [^s]voluntary offering, [^t]of the herd or [^u]of the flock, it must be without defect to be accepted; there shall be no defect in it. 







###### 22 



_Those that are_ blind, fractured, maimed, or _have_ a wart, a festering rash, or scabs, you shall not offer to the LORD, nor make of them an offering by fire on the altar to the LORD. 







###### 23 



Now _as for_ an ox or a lamb which has an [^v]overgrown or stunted _member_, you may present it as a [^w]voluntary offering, but for a vow it will not be accepted. 







###### 24 



Also anything _with its testicles_ squashed, crushed, torn off, or cut off, you shall not offer to the LORD, nor [^x]sacrifice in your land, 







###### 25 



nor shall you offer any of these _animals taken_ from the hand of a [^y]foreigner as the [^z]food of your God; for their deformity is in them, they have an impairment. They will not be accepted for you.'" 







###### 26 



Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 







###### 27 



"When an ox or a sheep or a goat is born, it shall [^aa]remain seven days [^ab]with its mother, and from the eighth day on it will be considered acceptable as a sacrifice of an offering by fire to the LORD. 







###### 28 



But, _whether_ it is an ox or a sheep, you shall not slaughter _both_ it and its young in one day. 







###### 29 



When you sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving to the LORD, you shall sacrifice it so that you may be accepted. 







###### 30 



It shall be eaten on the same day; you shall leave none of it until morning. I am the LORD. 







###### 31 



So you shall keep My commandments, and do them; I am the LORD. 







###### 32 



"And you shall not profane My holy name, but I will be sanctified among the sons of Israel; I am the LORD who sanctifies you, 







###### 33 



who brought you out from the land of Egypt, to be your God; I am the LORD." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

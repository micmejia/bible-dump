# Leviticus 23

***








###### 1 



The LORD spoke again to Moses, saying, 







###### 2 



"Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, 'The LORD's appointed times which you shall proclaim as holy convocations--My appointed times are these: 







###### 3 



'For six days work may be done, but on the seventh day there is a Sabbath of complete rest, a holy convocation. You shall not do any work; it is a Sabbath to the LORD in all your dwellings. 







###### 4 



'These are the appointed times of the LORD, holy convocations which you shall proclaim at the times appointed for them. 







###### 5 



In the [^a]first month, on the fourteenth day of the month [^b]at twilight is the LORD's Passover. 







###### 6 



Then on the fifteenth day of the same month there is the Feast of Unleavened Bread to the LORD; for seven days you shall eat unleavened bread. 







###### 7 



On the first day you shall have a holy convocation; you shall not do any laborious work. 







###### 8 



But for seven days you shall present an offering by fire to the LORD. On the seventh day is a holy convocation; you shall not do any laborious work.'" 







###### 9 



Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 







###### 10 



"Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, 'When you enter the land which I am going to give to you and you gather its harvest, then you shall bring in the sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest to the priest. 







###### 11 



He shall wave the sheaf before the LORD for you to be accepted; on the day after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it. 







###### 12 



Now on the day when you wave the sheaf, you shall offer a male lamb one year old without defect as a burnt offering to the LORD. 







###### 13 



Its grain offering shall then be [^c]two-tenths _of an ephah_ of fine flour mixed with oil, an offering by fire to the LORD _for_ a soothing aroma, with its drink offering, a [^d]fourth of a hin of wine. 







###### 14 



Until this very day, until you have brought in the offering of your God, you shall eat neither bread nor roasted grain nor new produce. It is to be a permanent statute throughout your generations in all your dwelling places. 







###### 15 



'You shall also count for yourselves from the day after the Sabbath, from the day when you brought in the sheaf of the wave offering; there shall be seven complete Sabbaths. 







###### 16 



You shall count fifty days to the day after the seventh Sabbath; then you shall present a new grain offering to the LORD. 







###### 17 



You shall bring in from your dwelling places two _loaves_ of bread as a wave offering, _made of_ [^e]two-tenths _of an ephah_; they shall be of a fine flour, baked with leaven as first fruits to the LORD. 







###### 18 



Along with the bread you shall present seven one-year-old male lambs without defect, and a bull of the herd and two rams; they are to be a burnt offering to the LORD, with their grain offering and their drink offerings, an offering by fire of a soothing aroma to the LORD. 







###### 19 



You shall also offer one male goat as a [^f]sin offering, and two male lambs one year old as a sacrifice of peace offerings. 







###### 20 



The priest shall then wave them with the bread of the first fruits as a wave offering with two lambs before the LORD; they are to be holy to the LORD for the priest. 







###### 21 



On this very day you shall make a proclamation as well; you are to have a holy convocation. You shall do no laborious work. It is to be a permanent statute in all your dwelling places throughout your generations. 







###### 22 



'When you reap the harvest of your land, moreover, you shall not reap to the very edges of your field nor gather the gleaning of your harvest; you are to leave them for the needy and the stranger. I am the LORD your God.'" 







###### 23 



Again the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 







###### 24 



"Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, 'In the [^g]seventh month on the first of the month you shall have a [^h]rest, a reminder by blowing _of trumpets_, a holy convocation. 







###### 25 



You shall not do any laborious work, but you shall present an offering by fire to the LORD.'" ## The Day of Atonement 







###### 26 



Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 







###### 27 



"On exactly the tenth day of this seventh month is the Day of Atonement; it shall be a holy convocation for you, and you shall humble [^i]yourselves and present an offering by fire to the LORD. 







###### 28 



You shall not do any work on this very day, for it is a Day of Atonement, to make atonement on your behalf before the LORD your God. 







###### 29 



If there is any [^j]person who does not humble himself on this very day, he shall be cut off from his people. 







###### 30 



As for any person who does any work on this very day, that person I will eliminate from among his people. 







###### 31 



You shall not do any work. It is to be a permanent statute throughout your generations in all your dwelling places. 







###### 32 



It _is to be_ a Sabbath of complete rest for you, and you shall humble [^k]yourselves; on the ninth of the month at evening, from evening until evening, you shall keep your Sabbath." 







###### 33 



Again the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 







###### 34 



"Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, 'On the fifteenth of this [^l]seventh month is the Feast of Booths for seven days to the LORD. 







###### 35 



On the first day is a holy convocation; you shall not do any laborious work. 







###### 36 



For seven days you shall present an offering by fire to the LORD. On the eighth day you shall have a holy convocation and present an offering by fire to the LORD; it is an assembly. You shall not do any laborious work. 







###### 37 



'These are the appointed times of the LORD which you shall proclaim as holy convocations, to present offerings by fire to the LORD--burnt offerings and grain offerings, sacrifices and drink offerings, _each_ day's matter on its own day-- 







###### 38 



besides _those of_ the Sabbaths of the LORD, and besides your gifts and besides all your [^m]vowed and [^n]voluntary offerings, which you give to the LORD. 







###### 39 



'On exactly the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the crops of the land, you shall celebrate the feast of the LORD for seven days, with a [^o]rest on the first day and a [^p]rest on the eighth day. 







###### 40 



Now on the first day you shall take for yourselves the [^q]foliage of beautiful trees, palm branches and branches of trees with thick branches and willows of the brook, and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God for seven days. 







###### 41 



So you shall celebrate it _as_ a feast to the LORD for seven days in the year. _It shall be_ a permanent statute throughout your generations; you shall celebrate it in the seventh month. 







###### 42 



You shall live in booths for seven days; all the native-born in Israel shall live in booths, 







###### 43 



so that your generations may know that I had the sons of Israel live in booths when I brought them out from the land of Egypt. I am the LORD your God.'" 







###### 44 



So Moses declared to the sons of Israel the appointed times of the LORD. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

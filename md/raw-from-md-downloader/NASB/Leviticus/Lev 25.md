# Leviticus 25

***








###### 1 



The LORD then spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai, saying, 







###### 2 



"Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, 'When you come into the land which I am going to give you, then the land shall have a Sabbath to the LORD. 







###### 3 



For six years you shall sow your field, and for six years you shall prune your vineyard and gather in its produce, 







###### 4 



but during the seventh year the land shall have a Sabbath rest, a Sabbath to the LORD; you shall not sow your field nor prune your vineyard. 







###### 5 



You shall not reap your harvest's [^a]aftergrowth, and you shall not gather your grapes of untrimmed vines; the land shall have a sabbatical year. 







###### 6 



_All of_ you shall have the Sabbath _produce_ of the land as food; for yourself, your male and female slaves, and your hired worker and your foreign resident, those who live as strangers among you. 







###### 7 



Even your cattle and the animals that are in your land shall have all its produce to eat. 







###### 8 



'You are also to count off seven Sabbaths of years for yourself, seven times seven years, so that you have the time of the seven Sabbaths of years, _that is_, forty-nine years. 







###### 9 



You shall then sound a ram's horn [^b]abroad on the tenth day of the seventh month; on the Day of Atonement you shall sound a horn all through your land. 







###### 10 



So you shall consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim [^c]a release throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you, [^d]and each of you shall return to his own property, [^e]and each of you shall return to his family. 







###### 11 



You shall have the fiftieth year as a jubilee; you shall not sow, nor harvest its aftergrowth, nor gather grapes _from_ its untrimmed vines. 







###### 12 



For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy to you. You shall eat its produce from the field. 







###### 13 



'On this year of jubilee each of you shall return to his own property. 







###### 14 



Furthermore, if you make a sale to your friend, or buy from your friend's hand, you shall not [^f]wrong one another. 







###### 15 



Corresponding to the number of years after the jubilee, you shall buy from your [^g]friend; he is to sell to you according to the number of years of crops. 







###### 16 



In proportion to [^h]a greater number of years you shall increase its price, and in proportion to [^i]fewer years you shall decrease its price, because _it is_ the number of crops _that_ he is selling to you. 







###### 17 



So you shall not [^j]wrong one another, but you shall [^k]fear your God; for I am the LORD your God. 







###### 18 



'You shall therefore [^l]follow My statutes and keep My judgments so as to carry them out, so that you may live securely on the land. 







###### 19 



Then the land will yield its produce, so that you can eat your fill and live securely on it. 







###### 20 



But if you say, "What are we going to eat in the seventh year if we do not sow nor gather in our produce?" 







###### 21 



then I will so order My blessing for you in the sixth year that it will bring forth the produce for three years. 







###### 22 



When you are sowing the eighth year, you can still eat old things from the produce, eating _the old_ until the ninth year when its produce comes in. ## The Law of Redemption 







###### 23 



'The land, moreover, shall not be sold permanently, because the land is Mine; for you are _only_ strangers and residents with Me. 







###### 24 



So for every [^m]piece of your property, you are to provide for the redemption of the land. 







###### 25 



'If a fellow countryman of yours becomes so poor that he sells part of his property, then his closest [^n]redeemer is to come and buy back what his relative has sold. 







###### 26 



Or in case someone has no redeemer, but [^o]recovers to find sufficient means for its redemption, 







###### 27 



then he shall calculate the years since its sale and refund the balance to the man to whom he sold it, and so return to his property. 







###### 28 



But if [^p]he has not found sufficient means to get it back for himself, then what he has sold shall remain in the hands of its purchaser until the year of jubilee; but at the jubilee it shall [^q]revert, so that he may return to his property. 







###### 29 



'Likewise, if a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city, then his redemption right remains _valid_ until a full year after its sale; his right of redemption lasts a full year. 







###### 30 



But if it is not bought back for him within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city passes permanently to its purchaser throughout his generations; it does not [^r]revert in the jubilee. 







###### 31 



The houses of the villages, however, which have no surrounding wall, shall be regarded [^s]as open fields; they have redemption rights and [^t]revert in the jubilee. 







###### 32 



As for the cities of the Levites, the Levites have a permanent right of redemption for the houses of the cities which are their possession. 







###### 33 



What, therefore, [^u]belongs to the Levites may be redeemed, and a house sale [^v]in the city of this possession [^w]reverts in the jubilee, because the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the sons of Israel. 







###### 34 



But pasture fields of their cities shall not be sold, for that is their permanent possession. ## Of Poor Countrymen 







###### 35 



'Now in case a countryman of yours becomes poor and his [^x]means among you falter, then you are to sustain him, _like_ a stranger or a resident, so that he may live with you. 







###### 36 



Do not take [^y]_any kind of_ interest from him, but [^z]fear your God, so that your countryman may live with you. 







###### 37 



You shall not give him your silver at interest, nor your food [^aa]for profit. 







###### 38 



I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan, _and_ to be your God. 







###### 39 



'Now if a countryman of yours becomes so poor with regard to you that he sells himself to you, you shall not subject him to a slave's service. 







###### 40 



He shall be with you as a hired worker, as _if he were_ a foreign resident; he shall serve with you up to the year of jubilee. 







###### 41 



He shall then leave you, he and his sons with him, and shall go back to his family, so that he may return to the property of his forefathers. 







###### 42 



For they are My servants whom I brought out from the land of Egypt; they are not to be sold _in_ a slave sale. 







###### 43 



You shall not rule over him with [^ab]severity, but are to revere your God. 







###### 44 



As for your male and female slaves whom you may have--you may acquire male and female slaves from the _pagan_ nations that are around you. 







###### 45 



You may also acquire _them_ from the sons of the foreign residents who reside among you, and from their families who are with you, whom they will have produced in your land; they also may become your possession. 







###### 46 



You may also pass them on as an inheritance to your sons after you, to receive as a possession; you can use them as permanent slaves. But in respect to your countrymen, the sons of Israel, you shall not rule with [^ac]severity over one another. ## Of Redeeming a Person Who Is Poor 







###### 47 



'Now if the [^ad]means of a stranger or of a foreign resident with you becomes sufficient, and a countryman of yours becomes poor in relation to him and sells himself to a stranger who is residing with you, or to the descendants of a stranger's family, 







###### 48 



then he shall have redemption right after he has been sold. One of his brothers may redeem him, 







###### 49 



or his uncle, or his uncle's son may redeem him, or one of his blood relatives from his family may redeem him; or [^ae]if he prospers, he may redeem himself. 







###### 50 



He then, with his purchaser, shall calculate from the year when he sold himself to him up to the year of jubilee; and the price of his sale shall correspond to the number of years _calculated. It is_ like the days of a hired worker _that_ he will be with him. 







###### 51 



If there are still many years _remaining_, he shall refund part of his purchase price in proportion to them for his own redemption; 







###### 52 



but if few years remain until the year of jubilee, he shall so calculate with him. In proportion to his years he is to refund _the amount for_ his redemption. 







###### 53 



He shall be with him like a worker hired year by year; he shall not rule over him with [^af]severity in your sight. 







###### 54 



Even if he is not redeemed by [^ag]these means, he shall still leave in the year of jubilee, he and his sons with him. 







###### 55 



For the sons of Israel are My servants; they are My servants whom I brought out from the land of Egypt. I am the LORD your God. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

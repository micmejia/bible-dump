# Leviticus 6

***








###### 1 



[^a]Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 







###### 2 



"When a person sins and acts unfaithfully against the LORD, and disavows _the rightful claim of_ his neighbor regarding a deposit or a security entrusted _to him_, or regarding robbery, or he has extorted from his neighbor, 







###### 3 



or has found what was lost and lied about it and sworn falsely, so that he sins regarding any of the things that people do; 







###### 4 



then it shall be, when he sins and becomes guilty, that he shall restore what he took by robbery or acquired by extortion, or the deposit which was [^b]entrusted to him, or the lost property which he found, 







###### 5 



or anything about which he swore falsely; he shall make restitution for it [^c]in full and add to it a fifth more. He shall give it to the one to whom it belongs on the day _he presents_ his guilt offering. 







###### 6 



Then he shall bring to the priest his guilt offering to the LORD, a ram without defect from the flock, according to your assessment, as a guilt offering, 







###### 7 



and the priest shall make atonement for him before the LORD, and he will be forgiven for any one of the things which he may have done to incur guilt." ## The Priest's Part in the Offerings 







###### 8 



[^d]Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 







###### 9 



"Command Aaron and his sons, saying, 'This is the law for the burnt offering: the burnt offering itself _shall remain_ on the hearth on the altar all night until the morning, and the fire on the altar is to be kept burning on it. 







###### 10 



The priest is to put on his linen robe, and he shall put on linen undergarments next to his [^e]body; and he shall take up the fatty ashes _to_ which the fire [^f]reduces the burnt offering on the altar and place them beside the altar. 







###### 11 



Then he shall take off his garments and put on other garments, and carry the fatty ashes outside the camp to a clean place. 







###### 12 



The fire on the altar shall be kept burning on it. It shall not go out, but the priest shall burn wood on it every morning; and he shall lay out the burnt offering on it, and offer up in smoke the fat portions of the peace offerings on it. 







###### 13 



Fire shall be kept burning continually on the altar; it is not to go out. 







###### 14 



'Now this is the law of the grain offering: the sons of Aaron shall present it before the LORD in front of the altar. 







###### 15 



Then one _of them_ shall lift up from it a handful of the fine flour of the grain offering, [^g]with its oil and all the incense that is on the grain offering, and he shall offer _it_ up in smoke on the altar, a soothing aroma, as its memorial offering to the LORD. 







###### 16 



And Aaron and his sons are to eat what is left of it. It shall be eaten as unleavened cakes in a holy place; they are to eat it in the courtyard of the tent of meeting. 







###### 17 



It shall not be baked with leaven. I have given it as their share from My offerings by fire; it is most holy, like the sin offering and the guilt offering. 







###### 18 



Every male among the sons of Aaron may eat it; it is a permanent ordinance throughout your generations, from the offerings by fire to the LORD. [^h]Whoever touches them [^i]will become consecrated.'" 







###### 19 



Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 







###### 20 



"This is the offering which Aaron and his sons are to present to the LORD on the day when he is anointed; the tenth of an [^j]ephah of fine flour as a [^k]regular grain offering, half of it in the morning and half of it in the evening. 







###### 21 



It shall be prepared with oil on a griddle. When it is _well_ stirred, you shall bring it. You shall present the grain offering in baked pieces as a soothing aroma to the LORD. 







###### 22 



The anointed priest who will be in his place [^l]among his sons shall [^m]offer it. By a permanent ordinance it shall be entirely offered up in smoke to the LORD. 







###### 23 



So every grain offering of the priest shall be burned entirely. It shall not be eaten." 







###### 24 



Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 







###### 25 



"Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, 'This is the law of the sin offering: in the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered, the sin offering shall be slaughtered before the LORD; it is most holy. 







###### 26 



The priest who offers it for sin shall eat it. It shall be eaten in a holy place, in the courtyard of the tent of meeting. 







###### 27 



[^n]Whoever touches its flesh [^o]will become consecrated; and when any of its blood spatters on a garment, you shall wash what spattered on it in a holy place. 







###### 28 



Also the earthenware vessel in which it was boiled shall be broken; and if it was boiled in a bronze vessel, then it shall be scoured and rinsed in water. 







###### 29 



Every male among the priests may eat it; it is most holy. 







###### 30 



But no sin offering of which any of the blood is brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the Holy Place shall be eaten; it shall be burned with fire. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Leviticus 9

***








###### 1 



Now it came about on the eighth day that Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel; 







###### 2 



and he said to Aaron, "Take for yourself a calf, a bull, as a sin offering and a ram as a burnt offering, _both_ without defect, and offer _them_ before the LORD. 







###### 3 



Then you shall speak to the sons of Israel, saying, 'Take a male goat as a sin offering, and a calf and a lamb, both one year old, without defect, as a burnt offering, 







###### 4 



and an ox and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD, and a grain offering mixed with oil; for today the LORD will appear to you.'" 







###### 5 



So they took what Moses had commanded to the front of the tent of meeting, and the whole congregation came near and stood before the LORD. 







###### 6 



And Moses said, "This is the thing which the LORD has commanded you to do, so that the glory of the LORD may appear to you." 







###### 7 



Moses then said to Aaron, "Come near to the altar and [^a]offer your sin offering and your burnt offering, so that you may make atonement for yourself and for the people; then make the offering [^b]for the people, so that you may make atonement for them, just as the LORD has commanded." 







###### 8 



So Aaron came near to the altar and slaughtered the calf of the sin offering which was for himself. 







###### 9 



Aaron's sons then presented the blood to him; and he dipped his finger in the blood and put _some_ on the horns of the altar, and poured out _the rest of_ the blood at the base of the altar. 







###### 10 



The fat and the kidneys and the [^c]lobe of the liver of the sin offering he then offered up in smoke on the altar, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. 







###### 11 



The flesh and the hide, however, he burned with fire outside the camp. 







###### 12 



Then he slaughtered the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons brought the blood to him, and he sprinkled it around on the altar. 







###### 13 



They brought the burnt offering to him in [^d]pieces, with the head, and he offered _them_ up in smoke on the altar. 







###### 14 



He also washed the entrails and the legs, and offered _them_ up in smoke with the burnt offering on the altar. 







###### 15 



Then he presented the people's offering, and took the goat of the sin offering which was for the people, and slaughtered it and offered it for sin, like the first. 







###### 16 



He also presented the burnt offering, and [^e]offered it according to the ordinance. 







###### 17 



Next he presented the grain offering, and filled his [^f]hand with some of it and offered _it_ up in smoke on the altar, besides the burnt offering of the morning. 







###### 18 



Then he slaughtered the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings which was for the people; and Aaron's sons brought the blood to him, and he sprinkled it around on the altar. 







###### 19 



As for the portions of fat from the ox and from the ram, the fat tail, the _fat_ covering, the kidneys, and the [^g]lobe of the liver, 







###### 20 



they now placed the portions of fat on the breasts; and he offered [^h]them up in smoke on the altar. 







###### 21 



But the breasts and the right thigh Aaron [^i]presented as a wave offering before the LORD, just as Moses had commanded. 







###### 22 



Then Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them, and he stepped down after making the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offerings. 







###### 23 



And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting. When they came out and blessed the people, the glory of the LORD appeared to all the people. 







###### 24 



Then fire went out from the LORD and consumed the burnt offering and the portions of fat on the altar; and when all the people saw _it_, they shouted and fell [^j]face downward. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

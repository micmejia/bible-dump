# Luke 11

***








###### 1 



It happened that while [^a]Jesus was praying in a certain place, when He had finished, one of His disciples said to Him, "Lord, teach us to pray, just as John also taught his disciples." 







###### 2 



And He said to them, "When you pray, say: '[^b]Father, [^c]hallowed be Your name. [^d]Your kingdom come. 







###### 3 



Give us each day our [^e]daily bread. 







###### 4 



And forgive us our sins, For we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us. And do not lead us into temptation.'" 







###### 5 



And He said to them, "[^f]Suppose one of you has a friend, and goes to him at midnight and says to him, 'Friend, lend me three loaves, 







###### 6 



because a friend of mine has come to me from a journey and I have nothing to serve him'; 







###### 7 



and from inside he answers and says, 'Do not bother me; the door has already been shut and my children [^g]and I are in bed; I cannot get up and give you _anything_.' 







###### 8 



I tell you, even if he will not get up and give him _anything just_ because he is his friend, yet because of his [^h]shamelessness he will get up and give him as much as he needs. 







###### 9 



"So I say to you, [^i]ask, and it will be given to you; [^j]seek, and you will find; [^k]knock, and it will be opened to you. 







###### 10 



For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks, it will be opened. 







###### 11 



Now [^l]which one of you fathers will his son ask for a [^m]fish, and instead of a fish, he will give him a snake? 







###### 12 



Or he will even ask for an egg, _and his father_ will give him a scorpion? 







###### 13 



So if you, _despite_ being [^n]evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will [^o]your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him?" ## Pharisees' Blasphemy 







###### 14 



And He was casting out a mute demon; when the demon had gone out, the man who was _previously_ unable to speak talked, and the crowds were amazed. 







###### 15 



But some of them said, "He casts out the demons by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons." 







###### 16 



Others, [^p]to test _Him_, were demanding of Him a [^q]sign from heaven. 







###### 17 



But He knew their thoughts and said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste; and a house _divided_ against [^r]itself falls. 







###### 18 



And if Satan also has been divided against himself, how will his kingdom [^s]stand? For you claim that I cast out the demons by Beelzebul. 







###### 19 



Yet if by Beelzebul I cast out the demons, by whom do your sons cast _them_ out? Therefore, they will be your judges. 







###### 20 



But if I cast out the demons by [^t]the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. 







###### 21 



When [^u]a strong _man_, fully armed, guards his own house, his possessions are [^v]secure. 







###### 22 



But when _someone_ stronger than he attacks him and overpowers him, _that man_ takes away his armor on which he had relied and distributes his plunder. 







###### 23 



The one who is not with Me is against Me; and the one who does not gather with Me scatters. 







###### 24 



"When the unclean spirit comes out of [^w]a person, it passes through waterless places seeking rest, and not finding _any_, it then says, 'I will return to my house from which I came.' 







###### 25 



And when it comes, it finds it swept and put in order. 







###### 26 



Then it goes and brings along seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they come in and live there; and the last _condition_ of that person becomes worse than the first." 







###### 27 



While [^x]Jesus was saying these things, one of the women in the crowd raised her voice and said to Him, "Blessed is the womb that carried You, and the breasts at which You nursed!" 







###### 28 



But He said, "On the contrary, blessed are those who hear the word of God and follow it." ## The Sign of Jonah 







###### 29 



Now as the crowds were increasing, He began to say, "This generation is a wicked generation; it demands a [^y]sign, and _so_ no [^z]sign will be given to it except the [^aa]sign of Jonah. 







###### 30 



For just as Jonah became a [^ab]sign to the Ninevites, so will the Son of Man be to this generation. 







###### 31 



The Queen of the South will rise up with the men of this generation at the judgment and condemn them, because she came from the ends of the earth to listen to the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, _something_ greater than Solomon is here. 







###### 32 



The men of Nineveh will stand up with this generation at the judgment and condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, _something_ greater than Jonah is here. 







###### 33 



"No one lights a lamp and puts _it away_ in a cellar nor under a basket, but on the lampstand, so that those who enter may see the light. 







###### 34 



Your eye is the lamp of your body; when your eye is [^ac]clear, your whole body also is full of light; but when it is [^ad]bad, your body also is full of darkness. 







###### 35 



So watch out that the light in you is not darkness. 







###### 36 



Therefore if your whole body is full of light, without any dark part, it will be wholly illuminated, as when the lamp illuminates you with its light." ## Woes upon the Pharisees 







###### 37 



Now when He had spoken, a Pharisee *asked Him to have lunch with him; and He went in and reclined _at the table_. 







###### 38 



When the Pharisee saw _this_, he was surprised that _Jesus_ had not first [^ae]ceremonially washed before the [^af]meal. 







###### 39 



But the Lord said to him, "Now you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and of the dish; but your inside is full of greed and wickedness. 







###### 40 



You foolish ones, did He who made the outside not make the inside also? 







###### 41 



But give that which is within as a charitable gift, and [^ag]then all things are clean for you. 







###### 42 



"But woe to you Pharisees! For you pay tithes of mint, rue, and every _kind of_ garden herb, and _yet_ you [^ah]ignore justice and the love of God; but these are the things you should have done without neglecting the others. 







###### 43 



Woe to you Pharisees! For you love the seat of honor in the synagogues and personal greetings in the marketplaces. 







###### 44 



Woe to you! For you are like [^ai]unseen tombs, and the people who walk over _them_ are unaware _of it_." 







###### 45 



One of the [^aj]lawyers *said to Him in reply, "Teacher, when You say these things, You insult us too." 







###### 46 



But He said, "Woe to you lawyers as well! For you load people with burdens that are hard to bear, [^ak]while you yourselves will not even [^al]touch the burdens with one of your fingers. 







###### 47 



Woe to you! For you build the [^am]tombs of the prophets, and _it was_ your fathers _who_ killed them. 







###### 48 



So you are witnesses and you approve of the deeds of your fathers; because _it was_ they _who_ killed them, and you build _their_ [^an]_tombs_. 







###### 49 



For this reason also, the wisdom of God said, 'I will send them prophets and apostles, and _some_ of them they will kill, and _some_ they will [^ao]persecute, 







###### 50 



so that the blood of all the prophets, shed since the foundation of the world, may be charged [^ap]against this generation, 







###### 51 



from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the house _of God_; yes, I tell you, it shall be charged [^aq]against this generation.' 







###### 52 



Woe to you [^ar]lawyers! For you have taken away the key of knowledge; you yourselves did not enter, and you hindered those who were entering." 







###### 53 



When He left that place, the scribes and the Pharisees began to be very hostile and to interrogate Him about many _subjects_, 







###### 54 



plotting against Him to catch [^as]Him in something He might say. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

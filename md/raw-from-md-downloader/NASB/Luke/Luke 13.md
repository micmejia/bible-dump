# Luke 13

***








###### 1 



Now on that very occasion there were some present who reported to Him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had [^a]mixed with their sacrifices. 







###### 2 



And Jesus responded and said to them, "Do you think that these Galileans were _worse_ sinners than all the _other_ Galileans _just_ because they have suffered this _fate_? 







###### 3 



No, I tell you, but unless you [^b]repent, you will all likewise perish. 







###### 4 



Or do you think that those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them were _worse_ [^c]offenders than all the _other_ people who live in Jerusalem? 







###### 5 



No, I tell you, but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish." 







###### 6 



And He _began_ telling this parable: "A man had a fig tree which had been planted in his vineyard; and he came looking for fruit on it and did not find _any_. 







###### 7 



And he said to the vineyard-keeper, 'Look! For three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree [^d]without finding any. Cut it down! Why does it even use up the ground?' 







###### 8 



But he answered and said to him, 'Sir, leave it alone for this year too, until I dig around it and put in fertilizer; 







###### 9 



and if it bears fruit next _year, fine_; but if not, cut it down.'" ## Healing on the Sabbath 







###### 10 



Now _Jesus_ was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath. 







###### 11 



And [^e]there was a woman who for eighteen years had had a [^f]sickness caused by a spirit; and she was bent over double, and could not straighten up at all. 







###### 12 



When Jesus saw her, He called her over and said to her, "Woman, you are freed from your sickness." 







###### 13 



And He laid His hands on her; and immediately she stood up straight again, and _began_ glorifying God. 







###### 14 



But the synagogue leader, indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, _began_ saying to the crowd in response, "There are six days during which work should be done; so come during them and get healed, and not on the Sabbath day." 







###### 15 



But the Lord answered him and said, "You hypocrites, does each of you on the Sabbath not untie his ox or donkey from the stall and lead it away to water _it_? 







###### 16 



And this woman, a daughter of Abraham as she is, whom Satan has bound for [^g]eighteen long years, should she not have been released from this restraint on the Sabbath day?" 







###### 17 



And as He said this, all His opponents were being [^h]humiliated; and the entire crowd was rejoicing over all the glorious things being done by Him. ## Parables of Mustard Seed and Leaven 







###### 18 



So He was saying, "What is the kingdom of God like, and to what shall I compare it? 







###### 19 



It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and threw into his own garden; and it grew and became a tree, and the birds of the sky nested in its branches." 







###### 20 



And again He said, "To what shall I compare the kingdom of God? 







###### 21 



It is like [^i]leaven, which a woman took and hid in three [^j]sata of flour until it was all leavened." ## Teaching in the Villages 







###### 22 



And He was passing through one city and village after another, teaching, and proceeding on His way to Jerusalem. 







###### 23 



And someone said to Him, "Lord, are there _just_ a few who are being saved?" And He said to them, 







###### 24 



"Strive to enter through the narrow door; for many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able. 







###### 25 



Once the head of the house gets up and shuts the door, and you begin standing outside and knocking on the door, saying, 'Lord, open up to us!' and He _then_ will answer and say to you, 'I do not know where you are from.' 







###### 26 



Then you will begin saying, 'We ate and drank in Your presence, and You taught in our streets!' 







###### 27 



And _yet_ He will [^k]say, 'I do not know where you are from; leave Me, all you [^l]evildoers.' 







###### 28 



In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but yourselves being thrown out. 







###### 29 



And they will come from east and west, and from north and south, and will recline _at the table_ in the kingdom of God. 







###### 30 



And behold, _some_ are last who will be first, and _some_ are first who will be last." 







###### 31 



At that very time some Pharisees approached, saying to Him, "Go away and leave this place, because Herod wants to kill You." 







###### 32 



And He said to them, "Go and tell that [^m]fox, 'Behold, I am casting out demons and performing healings today and tomorrow, and on the third _day_ I [^n]reach My goal.' 







###### 33 



Nevertheless I must go on My journey today and tomorrow and the next _day_; for it cannot be that a prophet would perish outside Jerusalem. 







###### 34 



Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the _city_ that kills the prophets and stones those who have been sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, just as a hen _gathers_ her [^o]young under her wings, and you were unwilling! 







###### 35 



Behold, your house is left to you _desolate_; and I say to you, you will not see Me until you say, 'Blessed is the One who comes in the name of the Lord!'" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Luke 15

***








###### 1 



Now all the tax collectors and [^a]sinners were coming near [^b]Jesus to listen to Him. 







###### 2 



And both the Pharisees and the scribes _began_ to complain, saying, "This man receives sinners and eats with them." 







###### 3 



And _so_ He told them this parable, saying, 







###### 4 



"What man among you, if he has a hundred sheep and has lost one of them, does not leave the _other_ ninety-nine in the [^c]open pasture and go after the one that is lost, until he finds it? 







###### 5 



And when he has found it, he puts it on his shoulders, rejoicing. 







###### 6 



And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, because I have found my sheep that was lost!' 







###### 7 



I tell you that in the same way, there will be _more_ joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who have no need of repentance. ## The Lost Coin 







###### 8 



"Or what woman, if she has ten [^d]silver coins and loses one coin, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and search carefully until she finds _it_? 







###### 9 



And when she has found _it_, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, 'Rejoice with me, because I have found the coin which I had lost!' 







###### 10 



In the same way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents." ## The Prodigal Son 







###### 11 



And He said, "A man had two sons. 







###### 12 



The younger of them said to his father, 'Father, give me the share of the estate that [^e]is coming to me.' And _so_ he divided his [^f]wealth between them. 







###### 13 



And not many days later, the younger son gathered everything together and went on a journey to a distant country, and there he squandered his estate in [^g]wild living. 







###### 14 



Now when he had [^h]spent everything, a severe famine occurred in that country, and he began doing without. 







###### 15 



So he went and [^i]hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed pigs. 







###### 16 



And he longed to have his fill of the carob pods that the pigs were eating, and no one was giving him _anything_. 







###### 17 



But when he came to [^j]his senses, he said, 'How many of my father's hired laborers have more than enough bread, but I am dying here [^k]from hunger! 







###### 18 



I will set out and go to my father, and will say to him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven, and [^l]in your sight; 







###### 19 



I am no longer worthy to be called your son; treat me as one of your hired laborers."' 







###### 20 



So he set out and came to [^m]his father. But when he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt compassion _for him_, and ran and [^n]embraced him and kissed him. 







###### 21 



And the son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and [^o]in your sight; I am no longer worthy to be called your son.' 







###### 22 



But the father said to his slaves, 'Quickly bring out the best robe and put it on him, and [^p]put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet; 







###### 23 



and bring the fattened calf, slaughter it, and let's eat and celebrate; 







###### 24 



for this son of mine was dead and has come to life again; he was lost and has been found.' And they began to celebrate. 







###### 25 



"Now his older son was in the field, and when he came and approached the house, he heard music and dancing. 







###### 26 



And he summoned one of the servants and _began_ inquiring what these things could be. 







###### 27 



And he said to him, 'Your brother has come, and your father has slaughtered the fattened calf because he has received him back safe and sound.' 







###### 28 



But he became angry and was not willing to go in; and his father came out and _began_ pleading with him. 







###### 29 



But he answered and said to his father, 'Look! For so many years I have been serving you and I have never [^q]neglected a command of yours; and _yet_ you never gave me a young goat, so that I might celebrate with my friends; 







###### 30 



but when this son of yours came, who has devoured your [^r]wealth with prostitutes, you slaughtered the fattened calf for him.' 







###### 31 



And he said to him, 'Son, you [^s]have always been with me, and all that is mine is yours. 







###### 32 



But we had to celebrate and rejoice, because this brother of yours was dead and _has begun_ to live, and _was_ lost and has been found.'" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

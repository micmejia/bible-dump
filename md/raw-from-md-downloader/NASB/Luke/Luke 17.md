# Luke 17

***








###### 1 



Now He said to His disciples, "It is inevitable that [^a]stumbling blocks come, but woe to one through whom they come! 







###### 2 



It is better for him if a millstone is hung around his neck and he [^b]is thrown into the sea, than that he may cause one of these little ones to [^c]sin. 







###### 3 



[^d]Be on your guard! If your brother sins, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him. 







###### 4 



And if he sins against you seven times a day, and returns to you seven times, saying, 'I repent,' you shall forgive him." 







###### 5 



The apostles said to the Lord, "Increase our faith!" 







###### 6 



But the Lord said, "If you [^e]had faith [^f]the size of a mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted and be planted in the sea'; and it would [^g]obey you. 







###### 7 



"Now which of you, having a slave plowing or tending sheep, will say to him after he comes in from the field, 'Come immediately and recline _at the table_ to eat'? 







###### 8 



On the contrary, will he not say to him, 'Prepare something for me to eat, and _properly_ [^h]clothe yourself and serve me while I eat and drink; and [^i]afterward you [^j]may eat and drink'? 







###### 9 



He does not thank the slave because he did the things which were commanded, does he? 







###### 10 



So you too, when you do all the things which were commanded you, say, 'We are [^k]unworthy slaves; we have done _only_ that which we ought to have done.'" ## Ten Men with Leprosy Healed 







###### 11 



While He was on the way to Jerusalem, He was passing [^l]between Samaria and Galilee. 







###### 12 



And as He entered a village, ten men with leprosy who stood at a distance met Him; 







###### 13 



and they raised their voices, saying, "Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!" 







###### 14 



When He saw _them_, He said to them, "Go and show yourselves to the priests." And as they were going, they were cleansed. 







###### 15 



Now one of them, when he saw that he had been healed, turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice, 







###### 16 



and he fell on his face at His feet, giving thanks to Him. And he was a Samaritan. 







###### 17 



But Jesus responded and said, "Were there not ten cleansed? But the nine--where _are they_? 







###### 18 



[^m]Was no one found who returned to give glory to God, except this foreigner?" 







###### 19 



And He said to him, "Stand up and go; your faith has [^n]made you well." ## Second Coming Foretold 







###### 20 



Now He was questioned by the Pharisees as to when the kingdom of God was coming, and He answered them and said, "The kingdom of God is not coming with [^o]signs that can be observed; 







###### 21 



nor will they say, 'Look, here _it is_!' or, 'There _it is_!' For behold, the kingdom of God is [^p]in your midst." 







###### 22 



And He said to the disciples, "The days will come when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see _it_. 







###### 23 



And they will say to you, 'Look there,' or, 'Look here!' Do not leave, and do not run after _them_. 







###### 24 



For just like the lightning, when it flashes out of one part [^q]of the sky, shines to the other part [^r]of the sky, so will the Son of Man be in His day. 







###### 25 



But first He must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation. 







###### 26 



And just as it happened in the days of Noah, so will it also be in the days of the Son of Man: 







###### 27 



_people_ were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, _and_ they were being given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all. 







###### 28 



[^s]It was the same as happened in the days of Lot: they were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling, they were planting, _and_ they were building; 







###### 29 



but on the day that Lot left Sodom, it rained fire and [^t]brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all. 







###### 30 



It will be [^u]just the same on the day that the Son of Man is revealed. 







###### 31 



On that day, the one who will be on the [^v]housetop, [^w]with his goods in the house, must not go down to take them out; and likewise the one in the field must not turn back. 







###### 32 



Remember Lot's wife. 







###### 33 



Whoever strives to [^x]save his [^y]life will lose it, and whoever loses _his life_ will keep it. 







###### 34 



I tell you, on that night there will be two in one bed; one will be taken and the other will be left. 







###### 35 



There will be two women grinding at the same _place_; one will be taken and the other will be left. 







###### 36 



[[^z]Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other will be left."] 







###### 37 



And responding, they *said to Him, "Where, Lord?" And He said to them, "Where the body _is_, there also the [^aa]vultures will be gathered." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Luke 19

***








###### 1 



_Jesus_ entered Jericho and was passing through. 







###### 2 



And [^a]there was a man called by the name of Zaccheus; he was a chief tax collector and he was rich. 







###### 3 



_Zaccheus_ was trying to see who Jesus was, and he was unable due to the crowd, because he was short in stature. 







###### 4 



So he ran on ahead and climbed up a [^b]sycamore tree in order to see Him, because He was about to pass through that _way_. 







###### 5 



And when Jesus came to the place, He looked up and said to him, "Zaccheus, hurry and come down, for today I must stay at your house." 







###### 6 



And he hurried and came down, and received Him [^c]joyfully. 







###### 7 



When _the people_ saw _this_, they all _began_ to complain, saying, "He has gone in [^d]to be the guest of a man who is a sinner!" 







###### 8 



But Zaccheus stopped and said to the Lord, "Behold, Lord, half of my possessions I am giving to the poor, and if I have extorted anything from anyone, I am giving back four times as much." 







###### 9 



And Jesus said to him, "Today salvation has come to this house, because he, too, is a son of Abraham. 







###### 10 



For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost." ## Parable of the Ten Minas 







###### 11 



Now while they were listening to these things, _Jesus_ went on to tell a parable, because He was near Jerusalem and they thought that the kingdom of God was going to appear immediately. 







###### 12 



So He said, "A nobleman went to a distant country to receive a kingdom for himself, and _then_ to return. 







###### 13 



And he called ten of his own slaves and gave them ten [^e]minas, and said to them, 'Do business _with this money_ [^f]until I come _back_.' 







###### 14 



But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, 'We do not want this man to reign over us.' 







###### 15 



When he returned after receiving the kingdom, he ordered that these slaves, to whom he had given the money, be summoned to him so that he would learn how much they had made by the business they had done. 







###### 16 



The first _slave_ appeared, saying, '[^g]Master, your [^h]mina has made ten minas more.' 







###### 17 



And he said to him, 'Well done, good slave; since you have been faithful in a very little thing, you are to have authority over ten cities.' 







###### 18 



The second one came, saying, 'Your [^i]mina, [^j]master, has made five minas.' 







###### 19 



And he said to him also, 'And you are to be over five cities.' 







###### 20 



And _then_ another came, saying, 'Master, here is your mina, which I kept tucked away in a handkerchief; 







###### 21 



for I was afraid of you, because you are a demanding man; you take up what you did not lay down, and reap what you did not sow.' 







###### 22 



He *said to him, '[^k]From your own lips I will judge you, you worthless slave. Did you know that I am a demanding man, taking up what I did not lay down, and reaping what I did not sow? 







###### 23 



And _so_ why did you not put my money in the bank, and when I came _back_, I would have collected it with interest?' 







###### 24 



And _then_ he said to the _other slaves_ who were present, 'Take the mina away from him and give it to the one who has the ten minas.' 







###### 25 



And they said to him, 'Master, he _already_ has ten minas.' 







###### 26 



'I tell you that to everyone who has, _more_ shall be given, but from the one who does not have, even what he does have shall be taken away. 







###### 27 



But as for these enemies of mine who did not want me to reign over them, bring _them_ here and slaughter them in my presence.'" ## Triumphal Entry 







###### 28 



After _Jesus_ said these things, He was going on ahead, going up to Jerusalem. 







###### 29 



When He approached Bethphage and Bethany, near the [^l]mountain that is called Olivet, He sent two of the disciples, 







###### 30 



saying, "Go into the village [^m]ahead of _you_; there, as you enter, you will find a colt tied, on which no one yet has ever sat; untie it and bring it _here_. 







###### 31 



And if anyone asks you, 'Why are you untying _it_?' you shall say this: '[^n]The Lord has need of it.'" 







###### 32 



So those who were sent left and found _it_ just as He had told them. 







###### 33 



And as they were untying the colt, its [^o]owners said to them, "Why are you untying the colt?" 







###### 34 



They said, "[^p]The Lord has need of it." 







###### 35 



And they brought it to Jesus, and they threw their cloaks on the colt and put Jesus _on it_. 







###### 36 



Now as He was going, they were spreading their cloaks on the road. 







###### 37 



And as soon as He was approaching, near the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of the disciples began to praise God [^q]joyfully with a loud voice for all the [^r]miracles which they had seen, 







###### 38 



[^s]shouting: "Blessed is the King, the One who comes in the name of the Lord; Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!" 







###### 39 



And _yet_ some of the Pharisees [^t]in the crowd said to Him, "Teacher, rebuke Your disciples!" 







###### 40 



Jesus replied, "I tell you, if these stop speaking, the stones will cry out!" 







###### 41 



When He approached _Jerusalem_, He saw the city and wept over it, 







###### 42 



saying, "If you had known on this day, even you, the _conditions_ for peace! But now they have been hidden from your eyes. 







###### 43 



For the days will come upon you [^u]when your enemies will put up a [^v]barricade against you, and surround you and hem you in on every side, 







###### 44 



and they will level you to the ground, and _throw down_ your children within you, and they will not leave in you one stone upon [^w]another, because you did not recognize the time of your visitation." ## Traders Driven from the Temple 







###### 45 



And Jesus entered the temple _grounds_ and began to drive out those who were selling, 







###### 46 



saying to them, "It is written: 'And My house will be a house of prayer,' but you have made it a den of robbers." 







###### 47 



And He was teaching daily in the temple; but the chief priests and the scribes and the leading men among the people were trying to put Him to death, 







###### 48 



and _yet_ they could not find [^x]anything that they might do, for all the people were hanging on to [^y]every word He said. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

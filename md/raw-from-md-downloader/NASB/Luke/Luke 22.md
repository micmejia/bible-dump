# Luke 22

***








###### 1 



Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which is called the Passover, was approaching. 







###### 2 



And the chief priests and the scribes were trying to find [^a]a way to put Him to death, since they were afraid of the people. 







###### 3 



And Satan entered Judas, the one called Iscariot, [^b]who belonged to the number of the twelve. 







###### 4 



And he left and discussed with the chief priests and officers how he was to betray Him to them. 







###### 5 



And they were delighted, and agreed to give him money. 







###### 6 



And _so_ he consented, and _began_ looking for a good opportunity to betray Him to them [^c]away from the crowd. 







###### 7 



Now the _first_ day of Unleavened Bread came, on which the Passover _lamb_ had to be sacrificed. 







###### 8 



And _so Jesus_ sent Peter and John, saying, "Go and prepare the Passover for us, so that we may eat _it_." 







###### 9 



They said to Him, "Where do You want us to prepare _it_?" 







###### 10 



And He said to them, "When you have entered the city, a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you; follow him into the house that he enters. 







###### 11 



And you shall say to the owner of the house, 'The Teacher says to you, "Where is the guest room in which I may eat the Passover with My disciples?"' 







###### 12 



And he will show you a large, furnished upstairs room; prepare _it_ there." 







###### 13 



And they left and found _everything_ just as He had told them; and they prepared the Passover. ## The Lord's Supper 







###### 14 



When the hour came, He reclined _at the table_, and the apostles with Him. 







###### 15 



And He said to them, "I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer; 







###### 16 



for I say to you, I shall not eat it _again_ until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God." 







###### 17 



And when He had taken a cup _and_ given thanks, He said, "Take this and share it among yourselves; 







###### 18 



for I say to you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine from now on until the kingdom of God comes." 







###### 19 



And when He had taken _some_ bread _and_ given thanks, He broke it and gave it to them, saying, "This is My body, which is being given for you; do this in remembrance of Me." 







###### 20 



And in the same way _He took_ the cup after they had eaten, saying, "This cup, which is poured out for you, is the new covenant in My blood. 







###### 21 



But behold, the hand of the one betraying Me is with [^d]Mine on the table. 







###### 22 



For indeed, the Son of Man is going as it has been determined; but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed!" 







###### 23 



And they began to debate among themselves which one of them it was who was going to do this. ## Who Is Greatest 







###### 24 



And a dispute also developed among them _as to_ which one of them was regarded as being the greatest. 







###### 25 



And He said to them, "The kings of the Gentiles domineer over them; and those who have authority over them are called 'Benefactors.' 







###### 26 



But _it is_ not this way for you; rather, the one who is the greatest among you must become like the youngest, and the leader like the servant. 







###### 27 



For who is greater, the one who reclines _at the table_ or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines _at the table_? But I am among you as the one who serves. 







###### 28 



"You are the ones who have stood by Me in My trials; 







###### 29 



and just as My Father has granted Me a kingdom, I grant you 







###### 30 



that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom, and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel. 







###### 31 



"Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has [^e]demanded to sift you _men_ like wheat; 







###### 32 



but I have prayed for [^f]you, that [^g]your faith will not fail; and [^h]you, when you have [^i]turned back, strengthen your brothers." 







###### 33 



But he said to Him, "Lord, I am ready to go with You both to prison and to death!" 







###### 34 



But He said, "I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow today until you have denied three times that you know Me." 







###### 35 



And He said to them, "When I sent you out without money belt and bag and sandals, you did not lack anything, did you?" They said, "_No_, nothing." 







###### 36 



And He said to them, "But now, [^j]whoever has a money belt is to take it along, likewise also a bag, and [^k]whoever has no sword is to sell his [^l]cloak and buy _one_. 







###### 37 



For I tell you that this which is written must be fulfilled in Me: 'And He was counted with wrongdoers'; for that which refers to Me has _its_ [^m]fulfillment." 







###### 38 



They said, "Lord, look, here are two swords." And He said to them, "It is enough." ## The Garden of Gethsemane 







###### 39 



And He came out and went, as was His habit, to the Mount of Olives; and the disciples also followed Him. 







###### 40 



Now when He arrived at the place, He said to them, "Pray that you do not come into temptation." 







###### 41 



And He withdrew from them about a stone's throw, and He knelt down and _began_ to pray, 







###### 42 



saying, "Father, if You are willing, remove this cup from Me; yet not My will, but Yours be done." 







###### 43 



[[^n]Now an angel from heaven appeared to Him, strengthening Him. 







###### 44 



And being in agony, He was praying very fervently; and His sweat became like drops of blood, falling down upon the ground]. 







###### 45 



When He rose from prayer, He came to the disciples and found them sleeping from sorrow, 







###### 46 



and He said to them, "Why are you sleeping? Get up and pray that you do not come into temptation." ## Jesus Betrayed by Judas 







###### 47 



While He was still speaking, behold, a crowd _came_, and the one called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading the way for them; and he approached Jesus to kiss Him. 







###### 48 



But Jesus said to him, "Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?" 







###### 49 



When those who were around Him saw what was going to happen, they said, "Lord, shall we strike with the sword?" 







###### 50 



And one of them struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his right ear. 







###### 51 



But Jesus responded and said, "[^o]Stop! No more of this." And He touched his ear and healed him. 







###### 52 



And Jesus said to the chief priests and officers of the temple and elders who had come against Him, "Have you come out with swords and clubs as _you would_ against a man inciting a revolt? 







###### 53 



While I was with you daily in the temple, you did not lay hands on Me; but [^p]this hour and the power of darkness are yours." ## Jesus' Arrest 







###### 54 



Now they arrested Him and led _Him away_, and brought _Him_ to the house of the high priest; but Peter was following at a distance. 







###### 55 



After they kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter was sitting among them. 







###### 56 



And a slave woman, seeing him as he sat in the firelight, and staring at him, said, "This man was with Him as well." 







###### 57 



But he denied _it_, saying, "I do not know Him, woman!" 







###### 58 



And a little later, another person saw him and said, "You are _one_ of them too!" But Peter said, "Man, I am not!" 







###### 59 



And after about an hour had passed, some other man _began_ to insist, saying, "Certainly this man also was with Him, for he, too, is a Galilean." 







###### 60 



But Peter said, "Man, I do not know what you are talking about!" And immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed. 







###### 61 



And _then_ the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had told him, "Before a rooster crows today, you will deny Me three times." 







###### 62 



And he went out and wept bitterly. 







###### 63 



The men who were holding [^q]Jesus in custody _began_ mocking Him and beating Him, 







###### 64 



and they blindfolded Him and _repeatedly_ asked Him, saying, "Prophesy, who is the one who hit You?" 







###### 65 



And they were saying many other things against Him, blaspheming. ## Jesus before the Sanhedrin 







###### 66 



When it was day, the [^r]Council of elders of the people assembled, both chief priests and scribes, and they led Him away to their council chamber, saying, 







###### 67 



"If You are the [^s]Christ, tell us." But He said to them, "If I tell you, you will not believe; 







###### 68 



and if I ask a question, you will not answer. 







###### 69 



But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God." 







###### 70 



And they all said, "So You are the Son of God?" And He said to them, "You say _correctly_ that I am." 







###### 71 



And _then_ they said, "What further need do we have of testimony? For we have heard _it_ ourselves from His _own_ mouth!" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

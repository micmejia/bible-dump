# Luke 23

***








###### 1 



Then the entire assembly of them set out and brought Him before Pilate. 







###### 2 



And they began to bring charges against Him, saying, "We found this man misleading our nation and forbidding _us_ to pay taxes to Caesar, and saying that He Himself is [^a]Christ, a King." 







###### 3 



Now Pilate asked Him, saying, "_So_ You are the King of the Jews?" And He answered him and said, "_It is as_ you say." 







###### 4 



But Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, "I find no grounds for charges in _the case of_ this man." 







###### 5 



But they kept on insisting, saying, "He is stirring up the people, teaching all over Judea, starting from Galilee, as far as this place!" 







###### 6 



Now when Pilate heard _this_, he asked whether the man was a Galilean. 







###### 7 



And when he learned that He belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod, [^b]since he also was in Jerusalem [^c]at this time. ## Jesus before Herod 







###### 8 



Now Herod was overjoyed when he saw Jesus; for he had wanted to see Him for a long time, because he had been hearing about Him and was hoping to see some [^d]sign performed by Him. 







###### 9 



And he questioned Him [^e]at some length; but He offered him no answer at all. 







###### 10 



Now the chief priests and the scribes stood _there_, vehemently charging Him. 







###### 11 



And Herod, together with his soldiers, treated Him with contempt and mocked Him, dressing Him in a brightly shining robe, and sent Him back to Pilate. 







###### 12 



And _so_ Herod and Pilate became friends with one another that very day; for previously, they had been enemies toward each other. ## Pilate Seeks Jesus' Release 







###### 13 



Now Pilate summoned to himself the chief priests, the [^f]rulers, and the people, 







###### 14 



and he said to them, "You brought this man to me on the ground that he is inciting the people to revolt; and behold, after examining _Him_ before you, I have found no basis at all in _the case of_ this man for the charges which you are bringing against Him. 







###### 15 



No, nor has Herod, for he sent Him back to us; and behold, nothing deserving death has been done by Him. 







###### 16 



Therefore I will [^g]punish Him and release Him." 







###### 17 



[[^h]Now he was obligated to release to them at the feast one _prisoner_.] 







###### 18 



But they cried out all together, saying, "Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas!" 







###### 19 



(_He was_ one who had been thrown into prison for a revolt that took place in the city, and for murder.) 







###### 20 



But Pilate, wanting to release Jesus, addressed them again, 







###### 21 



but they kept on crying out, saying, "Crucify, crucify Him!" 







###### 22 



And he said to them a third time, "Why, what has this man done wrong? I have found [^i]in His case no grounds for _a sentence of_ death; therefore I will [^j]punish Him and release Him." 







###### 23 



But they were insistent, with loud voices, demanding that He be crucified. And their voices _began_ to prevail. 







###### 24 



And _so_ Pilate decided to have their demand carried out. 







###### 25 



And he released the man for whom they were asking, who had been thrown into prison for a revolt and murder; but he handed Jesus over to their will. ## Simon Carries the Cross 







###### 26 



And when they led Him away, they seized a man, Simon of Cyrene, as he was coming in from the country, and placed on him the cross to carry behind Jesus. 







###### 27 



Now following Him was a large crowd of the people, and of women who were [^k]mourning and grieving for Him. 







###### 28 



But Jesus turned to them and said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, stop weeping for Me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. 







###### 29 



For behold, days are coming when they will say, 'Blessed are those who cannot bear, and the wombs that have not given birth, and the breasts that have not nursed.' 







###### 30 



Then they will begin to say to the mountains, 'Fall on us,' and to the hills, 'Cover us.' 







###### 31 



For if they do these things [^l]when the tree is green, what will happen [^m]when it is dry?" 







###### 32 



Now two others, who were criminals, were also being led away to be put to death with Him. ## The Crucifixion 







###### 33 



And when they came to the place called [^n]The Skull, there they crucified Him and the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left. 







###### 34 



[[^o]But Jesus was saying, "Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing."] And they cast lots, dividing His garments among themselves. 







###### 35 



And the people stood by, watching. And even the rulers were sneering at Him, saying, "He saved others; let Him save Himself if this is the [^p]Christ of God, His Chosen One." 







###### 36 



The soldiers also ridiculed Him, coming up to Him, offering Him sour wine, 







###### 37 



and saying, "If You are the King of the Jews, save Yourself!" 







###### 38 



Now there was also an inscription above Him, "THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS." 







###### 39 



One of the criminals who were hanged _there_ was [^q]hurling abuse at Him, saying, "Are You not the [^r]Christ? Save Yourself and us!" 







###### 40 



But the other responded, and rebuking him, said, "Do you not even fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? 







###### 41 



And we indeed _are suffering_ justly, for we are receiving [^s]what we deserve for our crimes; but this man has done nothing wrong." 







###### 42 



And he was saying, "Jesus, remember me when You come into Your kingdom!" 







###### 43 



And He said to him, "Truly I say to you, today you will be with Me in Paradise." 







###### 44 



It was now about [^t]the sixth hour, and darkness came over the entire land until [^u]the ninth hour, 







###### 45 



[^v]because the sun stopped shining; and the veil of the temple was torn [^w]in two. 







###### 46 



And Jesus, crying out with a loud voice, said, "Father, into Your hands I entrust My spirit." And having said this, He [^x]died. 







###### 47 



Now when the centurion saw what had happened, he _began_ praising God, saying, "This man was in fact [^y]innocent." 







###### 48 



And all the crowds who came together for this spectacle, after watching what had happened, _began_ to return _home_, [^z]beating their chests. 







###### 49 



And all His acquaintances and the women who accompanied Him from Galilee were standing at a distance, seeing these things. ## Jesus Is Buried 







###### 50 



And a man named Joseph, who was a member of the Council, a good and righteous man 







###### 51 



(he had not consented to their plan and action), _a man_ from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who was waiting for the kingdom of God-- 







###### 52 



this man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. 







###### 53 



And he took it down and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid Him in a tomb cut into the rock, where no one had ever lain. 







###### 54 



It was a [^aa]preparation day, and a Sabbath was about to [^ab]begin. 







###### 55 



Now the women who had come with Him from Galilee followed, and they saw the tomb and how His body was laid. 







###### 56 



And _then_ they returned and prepared spices and perfumes. And on the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

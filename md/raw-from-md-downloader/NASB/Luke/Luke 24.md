# Luke 24

***








###### 1 



But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came to the tomb bringing the spices which they had prepared. 







###### 2 



And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb, 







###### 3 



but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. 







###### 4 



While they were perplexed about this, behold, two men _suddenly_ stood near them in gleaming clothing; 







###### 5 



and as [^a]the women were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground, _the men_ said to them, "Why are you seeking the living One among the dead? 







###### 6 



He is not here, but He has [^b]risen. Remember how He spoke to you while He was still in Galilee, 







###### 7 



saying that the Son of Man must be handed over to sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise _from the dead_." 







###### 8 



And they remembered His words, 







###### 9 



and returned from the tomb and reported all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest. 







###### 10 



Now _these women_ were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Mary the _mother_ of James; also the other women with them were telling these things to the apostles. 







###### 11 



But these words appeared [^c]to them as nonsense, and they would not believe [^d]the women. 







###### 12 



Nevertheless, Peter got up and ran to the tomb; and when he stooped and looked in, he *saw the linen wrappings [^e]only; and he went away to his [^f]home, marveling at what had happened. ## The Road to Emmaus 







###### 13 



And behold, on that very day two of them were going to a village named Emmaus, which was [^g]sixty stadia from Jerusalem. 







###### 14 



And they were talking with each other about all these things which had taken place. 







###### 15 



While they were talking and discussing, Jesus Himself approached and _began_ traveling with them. 







###### 16 



But their eyes were kept from recognizing Him. 







###### 17 



And He said to them, "What are these words that you are exchanging with one another as you are walking?" And they came to a stop, looking sad. 







###### 18 



One _of them_, named Cleopas, answered and said to Him, "Are You _possibly_ the only one living near Jerusalem [^h]who does not know about the things that happened here in these days?" 







###### 19 



And He said to them, "What sort of things?" And they said to Him, "Those about Jesus the Nazarene, who proved to be a prophet mighty in deed and word in the sight of God and all the people, 







###### 20 



and how the chief priests and our rulers handed Him over to be sentenced to death, and crucified Him. 







###### 21 



But we [^i]were hoping that it was He who was going to redeem Israel. Indeed, besides all this, it is _now_ the third day since these things happened. 







###### 22 



But also some women among us left us bewildered. When they were at the tomb early in the morning, 







###### 23 



and did not find His body, they came, saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said that He was alive. 







###### 24 



And _so_ some of those who were with us went to the tomb, and found it just exactly as the women also had said; but Him they did not see." 







###### 25 



And _then_ He said to them, "[^j]You foolish men and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken! 







###### 26 



Was it not necessary for the [^k]Christ to suffer these things and to come into His glory?" 







###### 27 



Then beginning [^l]with Moses and [^m]with all the Prophets, He explained to them the things _written_ about Himself in all the Scriptures. 







###### 28 



And they approached the village where they were going, and He gave the impression that He was going farther. 







###### 29 



And _so_ they strongly urged Him, saying, "Stay with us, for it is _getting_ toward evening, and the day [^n]is now nearly over." So He went in to stay with them. 







###### 30 



And it came about, when He had reclined _at the table_ with them, that He took the bread and blessed _it_, and He broke _it_ and _began_ giving _it_ to them. 







###### 31 



And _then_ their eyes were opened and they recognized Him; and He vanished from [^o]their sight. 







###### 32 



They said to one another, "[^p]Were our hearts not burning within us when He was speaking to us on the road, while He was [^q]explaining the Scriptures to us?" 







###### 33 



And they got up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together and those who were with them, 







###### 34 



saying, "The Lord has really risen and has appeared to Simon!" 







###### 35 



They _began_ to relate [^r]their experiences on the road, and how He was recognized by them at the breaking of the bread. ## Other Appearances 







###### 36 



Now while they were telling these things, _Jesus_ Himself _suddenly_ stood in their midst and *said to them, "Peace _be_ to you." 







###### 37 



But they were startled and frightened, and thought that they were looking at a spirit. 







###### 38 



And He said to them, "Why are you frightened, and why are doubts arising in your [^s]hearts? 







###### 39 



See My hands and My feet, that [^t]it is I Myself; touch Me and see, because a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you _plainly_ see that I have." 







###### 40 



And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and His feet. 







###### 41 



While they still [^u]could not believe _it_ because of their joy and astonishment, He said to them, "Have you anything here to eat?" 







###### 42 



They served Him a piece of broiled fish; 







###### 43 



and He took it and ate _it_ in front of them. 







###### 44 



Now He said to them, "These are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all the things that are written about Me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled." 







###### 45 



Then He opened their [^v]minds to understand the Scriptures, 







###### 46 



and He said to them, "So it is written, that the [^w]Christ would suffer and rise from the dead on the third day, 







###### 47 



and that repentance [^x]for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed [^y]in His name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem. 







###### 48 



You are witnesses of these things. 







###### 49 



And behold, I am sending the promise of My Father upon you; but you are to stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high." ## The Ascension 







###### 50 



And He led them out as far as Bethany, and He lifted up His hands and blessed them. 







###### 51 



While He was blessing them, He parted from them and was carried up into heaven. 







###### 52 



And they, after worshiping Him, returned to Jerusalem with great joy, 







###### 53 



and were continually in the temple [^z]praising God. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

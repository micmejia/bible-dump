# Luke 7

***








###### 1 



When He had completed all His [^a]teaching in the hearing of the people, He went to Capernaum. 







###### 2 



Now a centurion's slave, who was highly regarded by him, was sick and about to die. 







###### 3 



When he heard about Jesus, he sent some [^b]Jewish elders to Him, asking Him to come and save the life of his slave. 







###### 4 



When they came to Jesus, they strongly urged Him, saying, "He is worthy for You to grant this to him; 







###### 5 



for he loves our nation, and it was he who built us our synagogue." 







###### 6 



Now Jesus _started_ on His way with them; but already, when He was not _yet_ far from the house, the centurion sent friends, saying to Him, "[^c]Lord, do not trouble Yourself _further_, for I am not worthy for You to enter under my roof; 







###### 7 



for that reason I did not even consider myself worthy to come to You; but _just_ [^d]say the word, and my servant [^e]shall be healed. 







###### 8 



For I also am a man placed under authority, with soldiers under myself; and I say to this one, 'Go!' and he goes, and to another, 'Come!' and he comes, and to my slave, 'Do this!' and he does _it_." 







###### 9 



Now when Jesus heard this, He was amazed at him, and turned and said to the crowd that was following Him, "I say to you, not even in Israel have I found such great faith." 







###### 10 



And when those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the slave in good health. 







###### 11 



Soon afterward _Jesus_ went to a city called Nain; and His disciples were going along with Him, [^f]accompanied by a large crowd. 







###### 12 



Now as He approached the gate of the city, [^g]a dead man was being carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow; and a sizeable crowd from the city was with her. 







###### 13 



When the Lord saw her, He felt compassion for her and said to her, "Do not go on weeping." 







###### 14 



And He came up and touched the coffin; and the bearers came to a halt. And He said, "Young man, I say to you, arise!" 







###### 15 



And the dead man sat up and began to speak. And _Jesus_ gave him _back_ to his mother. 







###### 16 



Fear gripped them all, and they _began_ glorifying God, saying, "A great prophet has appeared among us!" and, "God has [^h]visited His people!" 







###### 17 



And this report about Him spread throughout Judea and in all the surrounding region. ## The Messengers from John 







###### 18 



The disciples of John also reported to him about all these things. 







###### 19 



And after summoning [^i]two of his disciples, John sent them to the Lord, saying, "Are You the Coming One, or are we to [^j]look for another?" 







###### 20 



When the men came to Him, they said, "John the Baptist has sent us to You, [^k]to ask, 'Are You the Coming One, or are we to [^l]look for another?'" 







###### 21 



At that _very_ [^m]time He cured many _people_ of diseases and afflictions and evil spirits; and He gave sight to many _who were_ blind. 







###### 22 



And He answered and said to them, "Go and report to John what you have seen and heard: people who were blind receive sight, people who limped walk, people with leprosy are cleansed and people who were deaf hear, dead people are raised up, _and_ people who are poor have the gospel preached to them. 







###### 23 



And blessed is [^n]anyone who does not take offense at Me." 







###### 24 



When the messengers of John had left, He began to speak to the crowds about John: "What did you go out into the [^o]wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? 







###### 25 



[^p]But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Those who are splendidly clothed and live in luxury are _found_ in royal palaces! 







###### 26 



But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and one who is more than a prophet. 







###### 27 



This is the one about whom it is written: 'Behold, I am sending My messenger [^q]ahead of You, Who will prepare Your way before You.' 







###### 28 



I say to you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John; yet the one who is [^r]least in the kingdom of God is greater than he." 







###### 29 



When all the people and the tax collectors heard _this_, they acknowledged God's justice, having been baptized with the baptism of John. 







###### 30 



But the Pharisees and the [^s]lawyers rejected God's purpose for themselves, not having been baptized by [^t]John. 







###### 31 



"To what then shall I compare the people of this generation, and what are they like? 







###### 32 



They are like children who sit in the marketplace and call to one another, and say, 'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a song of mourning, and you did not weep.' 







###### 33 



For John the Baptist has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, 'He has a demon!' 







###### 34 



The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, 'Behold, a gluttonous man and a [^u]heavy drinker, a friend of tax collectors and [^v]sinners!' 







###### 35 



And _yet_ wisdom is vindicated by all her children." ## The Anointing in Galilee 







###### 36 



Now one of the Pharisees was requesting Him to eat with him, and He entered the Pharisee's house and reclined _at the table_. 







###### 37 



And there was a woman in the city who was a [^w]sinner; and when she learned that He was reclining _at the table_ in the Pharisee's house, she brought an alabaster vial of perfume, 







###### 38 



and standing behind _Him_ at His feet, weeping, she began to wet His feet with her tears, and she wiped them with the hair of her head, and _began_ kissing His feet and anointing them with the perfume. 







###### 39 



Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw _this_, he said to himself, "If this man were a prophet He would know who and what sort of person this woman _is_ who is touching Him, that she is a [^x]sinner!" ## Parable of Two Debtors 







###### 40 



And Jesus responded and said to him, "Simon, I have something to say to you." And he [^y]replied, "Say it, Teacher." 







###### 41 



"A moneylender had two debtors: the one owed five hundred [^z]denarii, and the other, fifty. 







###### 42 



When they were unable to repay, he canceled the debts of both. So which of them will love him more?" 







###### 43 



Simon answered and said, "I assume the one for whom he canceled the greater debt." And He said to him, "You have judged correctly." 







###### 44 



And turning toward the woman, He said to Simon, "Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave Me no water for My feet, but she has wet My feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. 







###### 45 



You [^aa]gave Me no kiss; but she has not stopped kissing My feet since the time I came in. 







###### 46 



You did not [^ab]anoint My head with oil, but she anointed My feet with perfume. 







###### 47 



For this reason I say to you, her sins, which are many, have been forgiven, for she loved much; but the one who is forgiven little, loves little." 







###### 48 



And He said to her, "Your sins have been forgiven." 







###### 49 



And _then_ those who were reclining _at the table_ with Him began saying [^ac]to themselves, "Who is this _man_ who even forgives sins?" 







###### 50 



And He said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you; go in peace." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

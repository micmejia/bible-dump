# Luke 9

***








###### 1 



Now He called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all the demons, and _the power_ to heal diseases. 







###### 2 



And He sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to perform healing. 







###### 3 



And He said to them, "Take nothing for _your_ journey, neither a staff, nor a [^a]bag, nor bread, nor money; and do not _even_ have two [^b]tunics. 







###### 4 



And whatever house you enter, stay there [^c]until you leave that city. 







###### 5 



And as for all who do not receive you, when you leave that city, shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them." 







###### 6 



And as they were leaving, they _began_ going [^d]throughout the villages, preaching the gospel and healing everywhere. 







###### 7 



Now Herod the tetrarch heard _about_ all that was happening; and he was greatly perplexed, because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead, 







###### 8 



and by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the prophets of old had risen. 







###### 9 



Herod said, "I myself had John beheaded; but who is this man about whom I hear such things?" And he kept trying to see Him. 







###### 10 



When the apostles returned, they gave an account to Him of all that they had done. And taking them with Him, He withdrew privately to a city called Bethsaida. 







###### 11 



But the crowds were aware _of this_ and followed Him; and He welcomed them and _began_ speaking to them about the kingdom of God, and curing those who had need of healing. ## Five Thousand Men Fed 







###### 12 



Now the day [^e]was ending, and the twelve came up and said to Him, "Dismiss the crowd, so that they may go into the surrounding villages and countryside and find lodging and get [^f]something to eat; because here, we are in a secluded place." 







###### 13 



But He said to them, "You give them _something_ to eat!" But they said, "We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless perhaps we go and buy food for all these people." 







###### 14 



(For there were about five thousand men.) But He said to His disciples, "Have them recline _to eat_ in groups of about fifty each." 







###### 15 



They did so, and had them all recline. 







###### 16 



And He took the five loaves and the two fish, and, looking up to heaven, He blessed them and broke _them_, and gave _them_ to the disciples _again and again_, to serve the crowd. 







###### 17 



And they all ate and were satisfied; and [^g]the broken pieces which they had left over were picked up, twelve baskets _full_. ## Peter Says Jesus is The Christ 







###### 18 



And it happened that while He was praying alone, the disciples were with Him, and He questioned them, saying, "Who do the [^h]people say that I am?" 







###### 19 



They answered and said, "John the Baptist, and others _say_ Elijah; but others, that one of the prophets of old has risen." 







###### 20 



And He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?" And Peter answered and said, "The [^i]Christ of God." 







###### 21 



But He [^j]warned them and instructed _them_ not to tell this to anyone, 







###### 22 



saying, "The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed and be raised on the third day." 







###### 23 



And He was saying to _them_ all, "If anyone wants to come after Me, he must deny himself, take up his cross daily, and follow Me. 







###### 24 



For whoever wants to save his [^k]life will lose it, but whoever loses his [^l]life for My sake, this is the one who will save it. 







###### 25 



For what good does it do a person if he gains the whole world, but loses or forfeits himself? 







###### 26 



For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when He comes in His glory and _the glory_ of the Father and the holy angels. 







###### 27 



But I say to you truthfully, there are some of those standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God." ## The Transfiguration 







###### 28 



About eight days after these sayings, He took along Peter, John, and James, and went up on the mountain to pray. 







###### 29 



And while He was praying, the appearance of His face became different, and His clothing _became_ white _and_ [^m]gleaming. 







###### 30 



And behold, two men were talking with Him; and they were Moses and Elijah, 







###### 31 



who, appearing in [^n]glory, were speaking of His departure, which He was about to accomplish at Jerusalem. 







###### 32 



Now Peter and his companions had been overcome with sleep; but when they were fully awake, they saw His glory and the two men who were standing with Him. 







###### 33 



And as [^o]these _two men_ were leaving Him, Peter said to Jesus, "Master, it is good that we are here; and let's make three [^p]tabernacles: one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah"--not realizing what he was saying. 







###### 34 



But while he was saying this, a cloud [^q]formed and _began_ to overshadow them; and they were afraid as they entered the cloud. 







###### 35 



And _then_ a voice came from the cloud, saying, "This is My Son, _My_ Chosen One; listen to Him!" 







###### 36 



And when the voice [^r]had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent, and reported to no one in those days any of the things which they had seen. 







###### 37 



On the next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met Him. 







###### 38 



And a man from the crowd shouted, saying, "Teacher, I beg You to look at my son, because he is my only _son_, 







###### 39 



and a spirit seizes him and he suddenly screams, and it throws him into a convulsion with foaming _at the mouth_; and only with difficulty does it leave him, mauling him _as it leaves_. 







###### 40 



And I begged Your disciples to cast it out, and they could not." 







###### 41 



And Jesus answered and said, "You unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and put up with you? Bring your son here." 







###### 42 



Now while he was still approaching, the demon slammed him to the ground and threw him into a convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy and gave him back to his father. 







###### 43 



And they were all amazed at the [^s]greatness of God. But while everyone was astonished at all that He was doing, He said to His disciples, 







###### 44 



"As for you, let these words sink into your ears: for the Son of Man is going to be [^t]handed over to men." 







###### 45 



But they [^u]did not understand this statement, and it was concealed from them so that they would not comprehend it; and they were afraid to ask Him about this statement. ## The Test of Greatness 







###### 46 



Now an argument [^v]started among them as to which of them might be the greatest. 







###### 47 



But Jesus, knowing [^w]what they were thinking in their hearts, took a child and had him stand by His side, 







###### 48 



and He said to them, "Whoever receives this child in My name receives Me, and whoever receives Me receives Him who sent Me; for the one who is least among all of you, this is the one who is great." 







###### 49 



John answered and said, "Master, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name; and we _tried to_ prevent him, because he does not follow along with us." 







###### 50 



But Jesus said to him, "Do not hinder _him_; for the one who is not against you is [^x]for you." 







###### 51 



When the days were approaching for His [^y]ascension, He [^z]was determined to go to Jerusalem; 







###### 52 



and He sent messengers on ahead of Him, and they went and entered a village of the Samaritans to [^aa]make arrangements for Him. 







###### 53 



And they did not receive Him, because [^ab]He was traveling toward Jerusalem. 







###### 54 



When His disciples James and John saw _this_, they said, "Lord, do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?" 







###### 55 



But He turned and rebuked them.[^ac] 







###### 56 



And they went on to another village. ## Exacting Discipleship 







###### 57 



As they were going on the road, someone said to Him, "I will follow You wherever You go." 







###### 58 



And Jesus said to him, "The foxes have holes and the birds of the sky _have_ nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head." 







###### 59 



And He said to another, "Follow Me." But he said, "Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father." 







###### 60 



But He said to him, "Allow the dead to bury their own dead; but as for you, go and proclaim everywhere the kingdom of God." 







###### 61 



Another also said, "I will follow You, Lord; but first permit me to say goodbye to those at my home." 







###### 62 



But Jesus said to him, "No one, after putting his hand to the plow and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

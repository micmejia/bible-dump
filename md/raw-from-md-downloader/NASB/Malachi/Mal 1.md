***








###### 1 



The pronouncement of the word of the LORD to Israel through [^a]Malachi: 







###### 2 



"I have loved you," says the LORD. But you say, "How have You loved us?" "_Was_ Esau not Jacob's brother?" declares the LORD. "Yet I have loved Jacob; 







###### 3 



but I have hated Esau, and I have made his mountains a desolation and _given_ his inheritance to the jackals of the wilderness." 







###### 4 



Though Edom says, "We have been beaten down, but we will [^b]return and build up the ruins"; this is what the LORD of armies says: "They may build, but I will tear down; and _people_ will call them the [^c]territory of wickedness, and the people [^d]with whom the LORD is indignant forever." 







###### 5 



And your eyes will see _this_, and you will say, "The LORD [^e]be exalted beyond the [^f]border of Israel!" ## Sin of the Priests 







###### 6 



"'A son honors _his_ father, and a servant his master. Then if I am a father, where is My honor? And if I am a master, where is My [^g]respect?' says the LORD of armies to you, the priests who despise My name! But you say, 'How have we despised Your name?' 







###### 7 



_You are_ presenting defiled [^h]food upon My altar. But you say, 'How have we defiled You?' In that you say, 'The table of the LORD is to be despised.' 







###### 8 



And when you present a blind _animal_ for sacrifice, is it not evil? Or when you present a lame or sick _animal_, is it not evil? So offer it to your governor! Would he be pleased with you, or would he receive you kindly?" says the LORD of armies. 







###### 9 



"But now, do indeed plead for God's favor, so that He will be gracious to us. [^i]With such an offering on your part, will He receive any of you kindly?" says the LORD of armies. 







###### 10 



"If only there were one among you who would shut the [^j]gates, so that you would not kindle _fire on_ My altar for nothing! I am not pleased with you," says the LORD of armies, "nor will I accept an offering from your hand. 







###### 11 



For from the rising of the sun even to its setting, My name _shall be_ great among the nations, and in every place frankincense is going to be offered to My name, and a grain offering _that is_ pure; for My name _shall be_ great among the nations," says the LORD of armies. 







###### 12 



"But you are profaning it by your saying, 'The table of the Lord is defiled, and as for its fruit, its food is to be despised.' 







###### 13 



You also say, 'See, [^k]how tiresome it is!' And you view it as trivial," says the LORD of armies, "and you bring what was taken by robbery and _what is_ lame or sick; so you bring the offering! Should I accept it from your hand?" says the LORD. 







###### 14 



"But cursed be the swindler who has a male in his flock and vows _it_, but sacrifices a blemished _animal_ to the Lord, for I am a great King," says the LORD of armies, "and My name is [^l]feared among the [^m]nations." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

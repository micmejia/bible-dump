# Malachi 2

***








###### 1 



"And now, this commandment is for you, the priests. 







###### 2 



If you do not listen, and if you do not take it to heart to give honor to My name," says the LORD of armies, "then I will send the curse upon you and I will curse your blessings; and indeed, I have cursed them _already_, because you are not taking _it_ to heart. 







###### 3 



Behold, I am going to rebuke your [^a]descendants, and I will spread [^b]dung on your faces, the [^c]dung of your feasts; and you will be taken away [^d]with it. 







###### 4 



Then you will know that I have sent this commandment to you, [^e]so that My covenant may [^f]continue with Levi," says the LORD of armies. 







###### 5 



"My covenant with him was _one of_ life and peace, and I gave them to him _as an object of_ [^g]reverence; so he [^h]revered Me and was in awe of My name. 







###### 6 



[^i]True instruction was in his mouth and injustice was not found on his lips; he walked with Me in peace and justice, and he turned many back from wrongdoing. 







###### 7 



For the lips of a priest should maintain knowledge, and _people_ should seek [^j]instruction from his mouth; for he is the messenger of the LORD of armies. 







###### 8 



But as for you, you have turned aside from the way; you have caused many to stumble [^k]by the instruction; you have ruined the covenant of Levi," says the LORD of armies. 







###### 9 



"So I also have made you despised and of low reputation [^l]in the view of all the people, since you are not keeping My ways but are showing partiality in the [^m]instruction." ## Sin in the Family 







###### 10 



Do we not all have one Father? Is it not one God _who_ has created us? Why do we deal treacherously, each against his brother so as to profane the covenant of our fathers? 







###### 11 



Judah has dealt treacherously, and an abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the sanctuary of the LORD [^n]which He loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign god. 







###### 12 



_As_ for the man who does this, may the LORD eliminate from the tents of Jacob _everyone_ who is awake and answers, or who presents [^o]an offering to the LORD of armies. 







###### 13 



And this is [^p]another thing you do: you cover the altar of the LORD with tears, with weeping and sighing, because He no longer gives attention to the [^q]offering or accepts _it with_ favor from your hand. 







###### 14 



Yet you say, "For what reason?" Because the LORD has been a witness between you and the wife of your youth, against whom you have dealt treacherously, though she is your marriage companion and your wife by covenant. 







###### 15 



[^r]But not one has done _so_ who has a remnant of the Spirit. And [^s]why the one? He was seeking a godly offspring. Be careful then about your spirit, and _see that_ none _of you_ deals treacherously against the wife of your youth. 







###### 16 



"For [^t]I hate [^u]divorce," says the LORD, the God of Israel, "and [^v]him who covers his garment with violence," says the LORD of armies. "So be careful about your spirit, that you do not deal treacherously." 







###### 17 



You have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet you say, "How have we wearied _Him_?" In that you say, "Everyone who does evil is good in the sight of the LORD, and He delights in them," or, "Where is the God of justice?" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

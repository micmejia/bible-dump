# Mark 1

***








###### 1 



The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, 







###### 2 



just as it is written in Isaiah the prophet: "Behold, I am sending My messenger [^a]before You, Who will prepare Your way; 







###### 3 



The voice of one calling [^b]out in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way of the Lord, Make His paths straight!'" 







###### 4 



John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, [^c]preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. 







###### 5 



And all the country of Judea was going out to him, and all the people of Jerusalem; and they were being baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins. 







###### 6 



John was clothed with camel's hair and _wore_ a leather belt around his waist, and [^d]his diet was locusts and wild honey. 







###### 7 



And he was [^e]preaching, saying, "After me One is coming who is mightier than I, and I am not fit to bend down and untie the straps of His sandals. 







###### 8 



I baptized you [^f]with water; but He will baptize you [^g]with the Holy Spirit." ## The Baptism of Jesus 







###### 9 



In those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. 







###### 10 



And immediately coming up out of the water, He saw the heavens [^h]opening, and the Spirit, like a dove, descending upon Him; 







###### 11 



and a voice came from the heavens: "You are My beloved Son; in You I [^i]am well pleased." 







###### 12 



And immediately the Spirit *brought Him out into the wilderness. 







###### 13 



And He was in the wilderness for forty days, being tempted by Satan; and He was with the wild animals, and the angels were serving Him. ## Jesus Preaches in Galilee 







###### 14 



Now after John was [^j]taken into custody, Jesus came into Galilee, [^k]preaching the gospel of God, 







###### 15 



and saying, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God [^l]is at hand; repent and [^m]believe in the gospel." 







###### 16 



As He was going along the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew, the brother of Simon, casting a net in the sea; for they were fishermen. 







###### 17 



And Jesus said to them, "Follow Me, and I will have you become fishers of people." 







###### 18 



Immediately they left their nets and followed Him. 







###### 19 



And going on a little farther, He saw [^n]James the son of Zebedee, and his brother John, [^o]who were also in the boat mending the nets. 







###### 20 



Immediately He called them; and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men, and went away [^p]to follow Him. 







###### 21 



They *went into Capernaum; and immediately on the Sabbath _Jesus_ entered the synagogue and _began_ to teach. 







###### 22 



And they were amazed at His teaching; for He was teaching them as _one_ having authority, and not as the scribes. 







###### 23 



Just then there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit; and he cried out, 







###### 24 



saying, "What [^q]business do you have with us, Jesus [^r]of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are: the Holy One of God!" 







###### 25 



And Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be quiet, and come out of him!" 







###### 26 



After throwing him into convulsions and crying out with a loud voice, the unclean spirit came out of him. 







###### 27 



And they were all amazed, so they debated among themselves, saying, "What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him." 







###### 28 



Immediately the news about Him spread everywhere into all the surrounding region of Galilee. ## Crowds Healed 







###### 29 



And immediately after they left the synagogue, they entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with [^s]James and John. 







###### 30 



Now Simon's mother-in-law was lying sick with a fever; and they immediately *spoke to [^t]Jesus about her. 







###### 31 



And He came to her and raised her up, taking _her by_ the hand, and the fever left her, and she served them. 







###### 32 



Now when evening came, after the sun had set, they _began_ bringing to Him all who were ill and those who were demon-possessed. 







###### 33 



And the whole city had gathered at the door. 







###### 34 



And He healed many who were ill with various diseases, and cast out many demons; and He would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew [^u]who He was. 







###### 35 



And in the early morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left _the house_, and went away to a secluded place, and prayed there _for a time_. 







###### 36 



Simon and his companions eagerly searched for Him; 







###### 37 



and they found Him and *said to Him, "Everyone is looking for You." 







###### 38 



He *said to them, "Let's go somewhere else to the towns nearby, so that I may also [^v]preach there; for this is why I came." 







###### 39 



And He went into their synagogues [^w]preaching throughout Galilee, and casting out the demons. 







###### 40 



And a man with [^x]leprosy *came to [^y]Jesus, imploring Him and kneeling down, and saying to Him, "If You are willing, You can make me clean." 







###### 41 



Moved with compassion, _Jesus_ reached out with His hand and touched him, and *said to him, "I am willing; be cleansed." 







###### 42 



And immediately the leprosy left him, and he was cleansed. 







###### 43 



And He sternly warned him and immediately sent him away, 







###### 44 



and He *said to him, "See that you say nothing to anyone; but go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." 







###### 45 



But he went out and began to proclaim it [^z]freely and to spread the news around, to such an extent that [^aa]Jesus could no longer publicly enter a city, but [^ab]stayed out in unpopulated areas; and they were coming to Him from everywhere. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

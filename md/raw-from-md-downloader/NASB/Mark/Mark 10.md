# Mark 10

***








###### 1 



Setting out from there, _Jesus_ *went to the region of Judea and beyond the Jordan; crowds *gathered to Him again, and, as He was accustomed, He once more _began_ to teach them. 







###### 2 



And _some_ Pharisees came up to Jesus, testing Him, and _began_ questioning Him whether it was lawful for a man to [^a]divorce _his_ wife. 







###### 3 



And He answered and said to them, "What did Moses command you?" 







###### 4 



They said, "Moses permitted _a man_ to write a [^b]certificate of divorce and [^c]send _his wife_ away." 







###### 5 



But Jesus said to them, "[^d]Because of your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment. 







###### 6 



But from the beginning of creation, _God_ created them male and female. 







###### 7 



For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother[^e], 







###### 8 



and the two shall become one flesh; so they are no longer two, but one flesh. 







###### 9 



Therefore, what God has joined together, no person is to separate." 







###### 10 



And in the house the disciples again _began_ questioning Him about this. 







###### 11 



And He *said to them, "Whoever [^f]divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her; 







###### 12 



and if she herself [^g]divorces her husband and marries another man, she is committing adultery." ## Jesus Blesses Little Children 







###### 13 



And they were bringing children to Him so that He would touch them; but the disciples rebuked them. 







###### 14 



But when Jesus saw _this_, He was indignant and said to them, "Allow the children to come to Me; do not [^h]forbid them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. 







###### 15 



Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child will not enter it at all." 







###### 16 



And He took them in His arms and _began_ blessing them, laying His hands on them. ## The Rich Young Ruler 







###### 17 



As He was setting out on a journey, a man ran up to Him and knelt before Him, and asked Him, "Good Teacher, what shall I do so that I may inherit eternal life?" 







###### 18 



But Jesus said to him, "Why do you call Me good? No one is good except God alone. 







###### 19 



You know the commandments: 'Do not murder, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not give false testimony, Do not defraud, Honor your father and mother.'" 







###### 20 



And he said to Him, "Teacher, I have kept all these things from my youth." 







###### 21 



Looking at him, Jesus showed love to him and said to him, "One thing you lack: go and sell all you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me." 







###### 22 



But he [^i]was deeply dismayed by [^j]these words, and he went away grieving; for he was one who owned much property. 







###### 23 



And Jesus, looking around, *said to His disciples, "How hard it will be for those who are wealthy to enter the kingdom of God!" 







###### 24 



And the disciples were amazed at His words. But Jesus responded again and *said to them, "Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God! 







###### 25 



It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God." 







###### 26 



And they were even more astonished, and said to Him, "[^k]Then who can be saved?" 







###### 27 



Looking at them, Jesus *said, "With people it is impossible, but not with God; for all things are possible with God." 







###### 28 



Peter began to say to Him, "Behold, we have left everything and have followed You." 







###### 29 



Jesus said, "Truly I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or farms, for My sake and for the gospel's sake, 







###### 30 



[^l]but that he will receive a hundred times as much now in [^m]the present age, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and farms, along with persecutions; and in the age to come, eternal life. 







###### 31 



But many _who are_ first will be last, and the last, first." ## Jesus' Sufferings Foretold 







###### 32 



Now they were on the road going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking on ahead of them; and they were amazed, and those who followed were fearful. And again He took the twelve aside and began to tell them what was going to happen to Him, 







###### 33 



_saying_, "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be [^n]handed over to the chief priests and the scribes; and they will condemn Him to death and will [^o]hand Him over to the Gentiles. 







###### 34 



And they will mock Him and spit on Him, and flog Him and kill _Him_; and three days later He will rise _from the dead_." 







###### 35 



[^p]James and John, the two sons of Zebedee, *came up to [^q]Jesus, saying to Him, "Teacher, we want You to do for us whatever we ask of You." 







###### 36 



And He said to them, "What do you want Me to do for you?" 







###### 37 



They said to Him, "[^r]Grant that we may sit, one on Your right and one on _Your_ left, in Your glory." 







###### 38 



But Jesus said to them, "You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?" 







###### 39 



They said to Him, "We are able." And Jesus said to them, "The cup that I drink you shall drink; and you shall be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized. 







###### 40 



But to sit on My right or on _My_ left is not Mine to give; but _it is_ for those for whom it has been prepared." 







###### 41 



Hearing _this_, the _other_ ten began to feel indignant with [^s]James and John. 







###### 42 



Calling them to Himself, Jesus *said to them, "You know that those who are recognized as rulers of the Gentiles domineer over them; and their [^t]people in high position exercise authority over them. 







###### 43 



But it is not this way among you; rather, whoever wants to become [^u]prominent among you shall be your servant; 







###### 44 



and whoever wants to be first among you shall be slave of all. 







###### 45 



For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His [^v]life as a ransom for many." ## Bartimaeus Receives His Sight 







###### 46 



Then they *came to Jericho. And _later_, as He was leaving Jericho with His disciples and a large crowd, a beggar who was blind _named_ Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, was sitting by the road. 







###### 47 



And when he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out and say, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!" 







###### 48 



Many were sternly telling him to be quiet, but he kept crying out all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me!" 







###### 49 



And Jesus stopped and said, "Call him _here_." So they *called the man who was blind, saying to him, "Take courage, stand up! He is calling for you." 







###### 50 



And throwing off his cloak, he jumped up and came to Jesus. 







###### 51 



And replying to him, Jesus said, "What do you want Me to do for you?" And the man who was blind said to Him, "[^w]Rabboni, _I want_ to regain my sight!" 







###### 52 



And Jesus said to him, "Go; your faith has [^x]made you well." And immediately he regained his sight and _began_ following Him on the road. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

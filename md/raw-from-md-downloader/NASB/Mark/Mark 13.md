# Mark 13

***








###### 1 



As He was going out of the temple, one of His disciples *said to Him, "Teacher, look! [^a]What wonderful stones and [^b]what wonderful buildings!" 







###### 2 



And Jesus said to him, "Do you see these great buildings? Not one stone will be left upon another, which will not be torn down." 







###### 3 



As He was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, [^c]James, John, and Andrew were questioning Him privately, 







###### 4 



"Tell us, when will these things come about, and what _will be_ the [^d]sign when all these things are going to be fulfilled?" 







###### 5 



And Jesus began to say to them, "See to it that no one misleads you. 







###### 6 



Many will come in My name, saying, 'I am _He!'_ and they will mislead many. 







###### 7 



When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed; _those things_ must take place; but _that is_ not yet the end. 







###### 8 



For nation will rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there will be earthquakes in various places; there will _also_ be famines. These things are _only_ the beginning of birth pains. 







###### 9 



"But [^e]be on your guard; for they will hand you over to _the_ [^f]courts, and you will be flogged in _the_ synagogues, and you will stand before governors and kings for My sake, as a testimony to them. 







###### 10 



And the gospel must first be preached to all the nations. 







###### 11 



And when they [^g]arrest you and hand you over, do not worry beforehand about what you are to say, but say whatever is given you at that time; for you are not the ones speaking, but _it is_ the Holy Spirit. 







###### 12 



And brother will betray brother to death, and a father _his_ child; and children will rise up against parents and [^h]have them put to death. 







###### 13 



And you will be hated by everyone because of My name, but it is the one who has endured to the end who will be saved. 







###### 14 



"Now when you see the abomination of desolation standing where it should not be--[^i]let the [^j]reader understand--then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains. 







###### 15 



[^k]Whoever is on the [^l]housetop must not go down, nor go in to get anything out of his house. 







###### 16 



And [^m]whoever is in the field must not turn back to get his cloak. 







###### 17 



But woe to those women who are pregnant, and to those who are nursing babies in those days! 







###### 18 



Moreover, pray that it will not happen in winter. 







###### 19 



For those days will be such a _time of_ tribulation as has not occurred since the beginning of the creation which God created until now, and never will _again_. 







###### 20 



And if the Lord had not shortened _those_ days, no [^n]life would have been saved; but for the sake of the [^o]elect, whom He chose, He shortened the days. 







###### 21 



And then if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the [^p]Christ'; _or_, 'Look, there _He is_'; do not believe _it_; 







###### 22 



for false christs and false prophets will arise, and will provide signs and wonders, in order to mislead, if possible, the elect. 







###### 23 



But beware; I have told you everything in advance. ## The Return of Christ 







###### 24 



"But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light, 







###### 25 



and the stars will be falling from heaven, and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken. 







###### 26 



And then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory. 







###### 27 



And then He will send forth the angels, and will gather together His [^q]elect from the four winds, from the end of the earth to the end of heaven. 







###### 28 



"Now learn the parable from the fig tree: as soon as its branch has become tender and sprouts its leaves, you know that summer is near. 







###### 29 



So you too, when you see these things happening, [^r]recognize that [^s]He is near, _right_ at the [^t]door. 







###### 30 



Truly I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place. 







###### 31 



Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away. 







###### 32 



But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father _alone_. 







###### 33 



"Watch out, stay alert; for you do not know when the _appointed_ time is. 







###### 34 



_It is_ like a man away on a journey, _who_ upon leaving his house and [^u]putting his slaves in charge, _assigning_ to each one his task, also commanded the doorkeeper to stay alert. 







###### 35 



Therefore, stay alert--for you do not know when the [^v]master of the house is coming, whether in the evening, at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or in the morning-- 







###### 36 



so that he does not come suddenly and find you asleep. 







###### 37 



What I say to you I say to all: 'Stay alert!'" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Mark 14

***








###### 1 



Now the Passover and _Festival of_ Unleavened Bread were two days away; and the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to arrest Him covertly and kill _Him_; 







###### 2 



for they were saying, "Not during the festival, otherwise there will be a riot of the people." 







###### 3 



While He was in Bethany at the home of Simon [^a]the Leper, He was reclining _at the table_, and a woman came with an alabaster vial of very expensive perfume of pure [^b]nard. She broke the vial and poured _the perfume_ over His head. 







###### 4 



But there were some indignantly _remarking_ to one another, "Why has this perfume been wasted? 







###### 5 



For this perfume could have been sold for over three hundred [^c]denarii, and _the money_ given to the poor." And they were scolding her. 







###### 6 



But Jesus said, "Leave her alone! Why are you bothering her? She has done a good deed for Me. 







###### 7 



For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want, you can do good to them; but you do not always have Me. 







###### 8 



She has done what she could; she has anointed My body beforehand for the burial. 







###### 9 



Truly I say to you, wherever the gospel is preached in the entire world, what this woman has done will also be told in memory of her." 







###### 10 



Then Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went off to the chief priests in order to [^d]betray Him to them. 







###### 11 



They were delighted when they heard _this_, and promised to give him money. And he _began_ seeking how to betray Him at an opportune time. ## The Last Passover 







###### 12 



On the first day of [^e]Unleavened Bread, when [^f]the Passover _lamb_ was being sacrificed, His disciples *said to Him, "Where do You want us to go and prepare for You to eat the Passover?" 







###### 13 



And He *sent two of His disciples and *said to them, "Go into the city, and a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you; follow him; 







###### 14 



and wherever he enters, say to the owner of the house, 'The Teacher says, "Where is My guest room in which I may eat the Passover with My disciples?"' 







###### 15 



And he himself will show you a large upstairs room furnished _and_ ready; prepare for us there." 







###### 16 



The disciples left and came to the city, and found _everything_ just as He had told them; and they prepared the Passover. 







###### 17 



When it was evening He *came with the twelve. 







###### 18 



And as they were reclining _at the table_ and eating, Jesus said, "Truly I say to you that one of you will [^g]betray Me--[^h]one who is eating with Me." 







###### 19 



They began to be grieved and to say to Him one by one, "Surely not I?" 







###### 20 



But He said to them, "_It is_ one of the twelve, the one who dips _bread_ with Me in the bowl. 







###### 21 



For the Son of Man is going away just as it is written about Him; but woe to that man [^i]by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! _It would have been_ good [^j]for that man if he had not been born." ## The Lord's Supper 







###### 22 



While they were eating, He took _some_ bread, and [^k]after a blessing He broke _it_, and gave _it_ to them, and said, "Take _it_; this is My body." 







###### 23 



And when He had taken a cup _and_ given thanks, He gave _it_ to them, and they all drank from it. 







###### 24 



And He said to them, "This is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many. 







###### 25 



Truly I say to you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine again, until that day when I drink it, new, in the kingdom of God." 







###### 26 



And after singing a [^l]hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. 







###### 27 



And Jesus *said to them, "You will all [^m]fall away, because it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.' 







###### 28 



But after I am raised, I will go ahead of you to Galilee." 







###### 29 



But Peter said to Him, "Even if they all [^n]fall away, yet I _will_ not!" 







###### 30 



And Jesus *said to him, "Truly I say to you, that [^o]this very night, before a rooster crows twice, you yourself will deny Me three times." 







###### 31 



But [^p]Peter _repeatedly_ said insistently, "_Even_ if I have to die with You, I will not deny You!" And they all were saying the same thing as well. ## Jesus in Gethsemane 







###### 32 



They *came to a place named [^q]Gethsemane; and He *said to His disciples, "Sit here until I have prayed." 







###### 33 



And He *took with Him Peter, [^r]James, and John, and began to be very distressed and troubled. 







###### 34 



And He *said to them, "My soul is deeply grieved, to the point of death; remain here and [^s]keep watch." 







###### 35 



And He went a little beyond _them_, and fell to the ground and _began_ praying that if it were possible, the hour might [^t]pass Him by. 







###### 36 



And He was saying, "Abba! [^u]Father! All things are possible for You; remove this cup from Me; yet not what I will, but what You _will_." 







###### 37 



And He *came and *found them sleeping, and *said to Peter, "Simon, are you asleep? Could you not [^v]keep watch for one hour? 







###### 38 



[^w]Keep watching and praying, so that you will not come into temptation; the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak." 







###### 39 



And again He went away and prayed, saying the same [^x]words. 







###### 40 



And again He came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy; and they did not know what to say in reply to Him. 







###### 41 



And He *came the third time, and *said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? That is enough. The hour has come; behold, the Son of Man is being [^y]betrayed into the hands of sinners. 







###### 42 



Get up, let's go; behold, the one who is betraying Me is near!" ## Betrayal and Arrest 







###### 43 



And immediately, while He was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, *came up, [^z]accompanied by a crowd with swords and clubs _who were_ from the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders. 







###### 44 



Now he who was betraying Him had given them a signal, saying, "Whomever I kiss, He is the one; arrest Him and lead Him away [^aa]under guard." 







###### 45 



And after coming, Judas immediately went to Him and *said, "Rabbi!" and kissed Him. 







###### 46 



And they laid hands on Him and arrested Him. 







###### 47 



But one of those who stood by drew his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest and [^ab]cut off his ear. 







###### 48 



And Jesus said to them, "Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest Me, as _you would_ against a man inciting a revolt? 







###### 49 



Every day I was with you within the temple _grounds_ teaching, and you did not arrest Me; but _this has taken place_ so that the Scriptures will be fulfilled." 







###### 50 



And [^ac]His disciples all left Him and fled. 







###### 51 



A young man was following Him, wearing _nothing but_ a linen sheet over _his_ naked _body_; and they *seized him. 







###### 52 



But he [^ad]pulled free of the linen sheet and escaped naked. ## Jesus before His Accusers 







###### 53 



They led Jesus away to the high priest; and all the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes *gathered together. 







###### 54 



And Peter had followed Him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest; and he was sitting with the [^ae]officers and warming himself at the [^af]fire. 







###### 55 



Now the chief priests and the entire [^ag]Council were trying to obtain testimony against Jesus to put Him to death, and they were not finding any. 







###### 56 



For many people were giving false testimony against Him, and _so_ their testimonies were not consistent. 







###### 57 



And _then_ some stood up and _began_ giving false testimony against Him, saying, 







###### 58 



"We heard Him say, 'I will destroy this [^ah]temple that was made by hands, and in three days I will build another, made without hands.'" 







###### 59 



And not even in this respect was their testimony consistent. 







###### 60 



And _then_ the high priest stood up _and came_ forward and questioned Jesus, saying, "Do You not offer any answer for what these men are testifying against You?" 







###### 61 



But He kept silent and did not offer any answer. Again the high priest was questioning Him, and *said to Him, "Are You the [^ai]Christ, the Son of [^aj]the Blessed _One_?" 







###### 62 



And Jesus said, "I am; and you shall see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of power, and coming with the clouds of heaven." 







###### 63 



Tearing his clothes, the high priest *said, "What further need do we have of witnesses? 







###### 64 



You have heard the blasphemy; how does it seem to you?" And they all condemned Him as deserving of death. 







###### 65 



And some began to spit on Him, and [^ak]to blindfold Him, and to beat Him with their fists and say to Him, "Prophesy!" Then the officers took custody of Him [^al]and slapped Him _in the face_. ## Peter's Denials 







###### 66 



And while Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the slave women of the high priest *came, 







###### 67 



and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him and *said, "You were with Jesus the Nazarene as well." 







###### 68 



But he denied _it_, saying, "I neither know nor understand what you are talking about." And he went out onto the [^am]porch.[^an] 







###### 69 



The slave woman saw him, and began once more to say to the bystanders, "This man is _one_ of them!" 







###### 70 



But again he denied it. And after a little while the bystanders were again saying to Peter, "You really are _one_ of them, for you are a Galilean as well." 







###### 71 



But he began to [^ao]curse _himself_ and to swear, "I do not know this man of whom you speak!" 







###### 72 



And immediately a rooster crowed a second time. And Peter remembered how Jesus had made the remark to him, "Before a rooster crows twice, you will deny Me three times." And [^ap]he hurried on and _began to_ weep. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

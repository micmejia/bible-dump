# Mark 15

***








###### 1 



Early in the morning the chief priests with the elders, scribes, and the entire [^a]Council immediately held a consultation; and they bound Jesus and led Him away, and turned Him over to Pilate. 







###### 2 



Pilate questioned Him: "_So_ You are the King of the Jews?" And He answered him, "_It is as_ you say." 







###### 3 



And the chief priests _started_ accusing Him [^b]of many things. 







###### 4 



But Pilate questioned Him again, saying, "Do You offer nothing in answer? See how many charges they are bringing against You!" 







###### 5 



But Jesus said nothing further in answer, so Pilate was amazed. 







###### 6 



Now at _the Passover_ Feast he used to release for them _any_ one prisoner whom they requested. 







###### 7 



And the one named Barabbas had been imprisoned with the rebels who had committed murder in the revolt. 







###### 8 



And the crowd went up and began asking _Pilate to do_ as he had been accustomed to do for them. 







###### 9 



Pilate answered them, saying, "Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?" 







###### 10 



For he was aware that the chief priests had handed Him over because of envy. 







###### 11 



But the chief priests stirred up the crowd _to ask him_ to release Barabbas for them instead. 







###### 12 



And responding again, Pilate said to them, "Then what shall I do with Him whom you call the King of the Jews?" 







###### 13 



They shouted [^c]back, "Crucify Him!" 







###### 14 



But Pilate said to them, "Why, what [^d]evil has He done?" But they shouted all the more, "Crucify Him!" 







###### 15 



Intent on satisfying the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas for them, and after having Jesus flogged, he handed Him over to be crucified. ## Jesus Is Mocked 







###### 16 



Now the soldiers took Him away into the [^e]palace (that is, the Praetorium), and they *called together the whole _Roman_ [^f]cohort. 







###### 17 



And they *dressed Him in [^g]purple, and after twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on Him; 







###### 18 



and they began saluting Him: "Hail, King of the Jews!" 







###### 19 



And they _repeatedly_ beat His head with a [^h]reed and spit on Him, and kneeling, they bowed down before Him. 







###### 20 



And after they had mocked Him, they took the [^i]purple _cloak_ off Him and put His _own_ garments on Him. And they *led Him out to crucify Him. 







###### 21 



And they *compelled a passer-by coming from the country, Simon of Cyrene (the father of Alexander and Rufus), to carry His cross. ## The Crucifixion 







###### 22 



Then they *brought Him to the place Golgotha, which is translated, Place of a Skull. 







###### 23 



And they tried to give Him wine mixed with myrrh; but He did not take _it_. 







###### 24 



And they *crucified Him, and *divided up His garments among themselves, casting [^j]lots for them _to decide_ [^k]what each man would take. 







###### 25 



Now it was the [^l]third hour [^m]when they crucified Him. 







###### 26 



The inscription of the charge against Him [^n]read, "THE KING OF THE JEWS." 







###### 27 



And they *crucified two [^o]rebels with Him, one on His right and one on His left.[^p] 







###### 29 



Those passing by were [^q]hurling abuse at Him, shaking their heads and saying, "Ha! You who _are going to_ destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, 







###### 30 



save Yourself by coming down from the cross!" 







###### 31 



In the same way the chief priests also, along with the scribes, were mocking _Him_ among themselves and saying, "He saved others; [^r]He cannot save Himself! 







###### 32 



Let _this_ Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, so that we may see and believe!" Those who were crucified with Him were also insulting Him. 







###### 33 



When the [^s]sixth hour came, darkness [^t]fell over the whole land until the [^u]ninth hour. 







###### 34 



At the [^v]ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lema sabaktanei?" which is translated, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" 







###### 35 



And when some of the bystanders heard _Him_, they _began_ saying, "Look! He is calling for Elijah!" 







###### 36 



And someone ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on a reed, and gave Him a drink, saying, "[^w]Let us see if Elijah comes to take Him down." 







###### 37 



But Jesus let out a loud cry, and [^x]died. 







###### 38 



And the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. 







###### 39 



And when the centurion, who was standing [^y]right in front of Him, saw that He [^z]died in this way, he said, "Truly this man was [^aa]the Son of God!" 







###### 40 



Now there were also _some_ women watching from a distance, among whom _were_ Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of [^ab]James the [^ac]Less and Joses, and Salome. 







###### 41 



When He was in Galilee, they used to follow Him and serve Him; and _there were_ many other women who came up with Him to Jerusalem. ## Jesus Is Buried 







###### 42 



When evening had already come, since it was the preparation day, that is, the day before the Sabbath, 







###### 43 



Joseph of Arimathea came, a prominent member of the Council, who was himself also waiting for the kingdom of God; and he gathered up courage and went in before Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. 







###### 44 



Now Pilate wondered if He was dead by this time, and summoning the centurion, he questioned him as to whether He was already dead. 







###### 45 



And after learning this from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph. 







###### 46 



Joseph bought a linen cloth, took Him down, wrapped Him in the linen cloth, and laid Him in a tomb which had been cut out in the rock; and he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb. 







###### 47 



Mary Magdalene and Mary the _mother_ of Joses were watching _to see_ where He was laid. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Mark 3

***








###### 1 



He entered a synagogue again; and a man was there whose hand was withered. 







###### 2 



And they were watching Him [^a]closely _to see_ if He would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse Him. 







###### 3 



He *said to the man with the withered hand, "[^b]Get up and come forward!" 







###### 4 



And He *said to them, "Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath or to do harm, to save a life or to kill?" But they kept silent. 







###### 5 



After looking around at them with anger, grieved at their hardness of heart, He *said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored. 







###### 6 



The Pharisees went out and immediately _began_ [^c]conspiring with the Herodians against Him, _as to_ how they might put Him to death. 







###### 7 



Jesus withdrew to the sea with His disciples; and a large multitude from Galilee followed, and _also_ from Judea, 







###### 8 



and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and beyond the Jordan, and the vicinity of Tyre and Sidon, a great number of people heard about everything that He was doing and came to Him. 







###### 9 



And He told His disciples _to see_ that a boat would be ready for Him because of the [^d]masses, so that they would not crowd Him; 







###### 10 



for He had healed many, with the result that all those who had diseases pushed in around Him in order to touch Him. 







###### 11 



And whenever the unclean spirits saw Him, they would fall down before Him and shout, "You are the Son of God!" 







###### 12 



And He strongly warned them not to [^e]reveal who He was. ## The Twelve Are Chosen 







###### 13 



And He *went up on the mountain and *summoned those whom He Himself wanted, and they came to Him. 







###### 14 



And He appointed twelve, so that they would be with Him and that He _could_ send them out to preach, 







###### 15 



and to have authority to cast out the demons. 







###### 16 



And He appointed the twelve: Simon (to whom He gave the name Peter), 







###### 17 



[^f]James the _son_ of Zebedee and John the brother of [^g]James (to them He gave the name Boanerges, which means, "Sons of Thunder"); 







###### 18 



and Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, [^h]James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, and Simon the [^i]Zealot; 







###### 19 



and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him. 







###### 20 



And He *came [^j]home, and the crowd *gathered again, to such an extent that they could not even eat [^k]a meal. 







###### 21 



And when His own [^l]people heard _about this_, they came out to take custody of Him; for they were saying, "He has lost His senses." 







###### 22 



The scribes who came down from Jerusalem were saying, "He [^m]is possessed by [^n]Beelzebul," and "He casts out the demons by the ruler of the demons." 







###### 23 



And _so_ He called them to Himself and _began_ speaking to them in parables: "How can Satan cast out Satan? 







###### 24 



And if a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. 







###### 25 



If a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand. 







###### 26 



And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but [^o]he is finished! 







###### 27 



But no one can enter the strong man's house and plunder his property unless he first ties up the strong man, and then he will plunder his house. 







###### 28 



"Truly I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the sons _and daughters_ of men, and whatever blasphemies they commit; 







###### 29 



but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin"-- 







###### 30 



because they were saying, "He has an unclean spirit." 







###### 31 



Then His mother and His brothers *came, and while standing outside they sent _word_ to Him, calling _for_ Him. 







###### 32 



And a crowd was sitting around Him, and they *said to Him, "Behold, Your mother and Your brothers are outside looking for You." 







###### 33 



Answering them, He *said, "Who are My mother and My brothers?" 







###### 34 



And looking around at those who were sitting around Him, He *said, "Here are My mother and My brothers! 







###### 35 



For whoever does the will of God, this is My brother, and sister, and mother." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

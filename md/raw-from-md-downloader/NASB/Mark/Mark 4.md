# Mark 4

***








###### 1 



Again He began to teach by the sea. And such a very large crowd gathered to Him that He got into a boat on the sea and sat down; and the whole crowd was by the sea on the land. 







###### 2 



And He was teaching them many things in parables, and was saying to them in His teaching, 







###### 3 



"Listen _to this_! Behold, the sower went out to sow; 







###### 4 



as he was sowing, some _seed_ fell beside the road, and the birds came and ate it up. 







###### 5 



Other _seed_ fell on the rocky _ground_ where it did not have much soil; and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of soil. 







###### 6 



And when the sun had risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away. 







###### 7 



Other _seed_ fell among the thorns, and the thorns came up and choked it, and it yielded no crop. 







###### 8 



Other _seeds_ fell into the good soil, and as they grew up and increased, they yielded a crop and produced thirty, sixty, and a hundred _times as much_." 







###### 9 



And He was saying, "He who has ears to hear, [^a]let him hear." 







###### 10 



As soon as He was alone, [^b]His followers, along with the twelve _disciples, began_ asking Him _about_ the parables. 







###### 11 



And He was saying to them, "To you has been given the mystery of the kingdom of God, but for those who are outside, everything comes in parables, 







###### 12 



so that while seeing they may see, and not perceive, and while hearing, they may hear, and not understand, otherwise they might return and it would be forgiven them." ## Explanation of the Parable 







###### 13 



And He *said to them, "Do you not understand this parable? How will you understand all the parables? 







###### 14 



The sower sows the word. 







###### 15 



These are the ones who are beside the road where the word is sown; and when they hear, immediately Satan comes and takes away the word which has been sown in them. 







###### 16 



And in a similar way these are the ones sown _with seed_ on the rocky _places_, who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy; 







###### 17 



and _yet_ they have no _firm_ root in themselves, but are _only_ temporary; then, when affliction or persecution occurs because of the word, immediately they [^c]fall away. 







###### 18 



And others are the ones sown _with seed_ among the thorns; these are the ones who have heard the word, 







###### 19 



but the worries of the [^d]world, and the deceitfulness of wealth, and the desires for other things enter and choke the word, and it [^e]becomes unfruitful. 







###### 20 



And those are the ones sown _with seed_ on the good soil; and they hear the word and accept _it_ and bear fruit, thirty, sixty, and a hundred _times as much_." 







###### 21 



And He was saying to them, "A lamp is not brought to be put under a [^f]basket, or under a bed, is it? Is it not _brought_ to be put on the lampstand? 







###### 22 



For nothing is hidden, except to be revealed; nor has _anything_ been secret, but that it would come to light. 







###### 23 



If anyone has ears to hear, [^g]let him hear." 







###### 24 



And He was saying to them, "Take care what you listen to. [^h]By your standard of measure it will be measured to you; and _more_ will be given you besides. 







###### 25 



For whoever has, to him _more_ will be given; and whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him." ## Parable of the Seed 







###### 26 



And He was saying, "The kingdom of God is like a man who casts seed upon the soil; 







###### 27 



and he goes to bed at night and gets up daily, and the seed sprouts and grows--how, he himself does not know. 







###### 28 



The soil produces crops by itself; first the stalk, then the head, then the mature grain in the head. 







###### 29 



Now when the crop permits, he immediately [^i]puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come." ## Parable of the Mustard Seed 







###### 30 



And He was saying, "How shall we [^j]picture the kingdom of God, or by what parable shall we present it? 







###### 31 



_It is_ like a mustard seed, which, when sown upon the soil, though it is the smallest of all the seeds that are upon the soil, 







###### 32 



yet when it is sown, it grows up and becomes larger than all the garden plants, and forms large branches, with the result that the birds of the sky can nest under its shade." 







###### 33 



And with many such parables He was speaking the word to them, so far as they were able to [^k]understand _it_; 







###### 34 



and He did not speak to them without a parable; but He was explaining everything privately to His own disciples. ## Jesus Stills the Sea 







###### 35 



On that day, when evening came, He *said to them, "Let's go over to the other side." 







###### 36 



After dismissing the crowd, they *took Him along with them in the boat, just as He was; and other boats were with Him. 







###### 37 



And a fierce gale of wind *developed, and the waves were breaking over the boat so much that the boat was already filling _with water_. 







###### 38 



And _yet Jesus_ Himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion; and they *woke Him and *said to Him, "Teacher, do You not care that we are perishing?" 







###### 39 



And He got up and rebuked the wind and said to the sea, "Hush, be still." And the wind died down and [^l]it became perfectly calm. 







###### 40 



And He said to them, "Why are you [^m]afraid? Do you still have no faith?" 







###### 41 



They became very much afraid and said to one another, "Who, then, is this, that even the wind and the sea obey Him?" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Mark 5

***








###### 1 



They came to the other side of the sea, into the region of the Gerasenes. 







###### 2 



When He got out of the boat, immediately a man from the tombs with an unclean spirit met Him. 







###### 3 



He lived among the tombs; and no one was able to bind him anymore, not even with a chain, 







###### 4 



because he had often been bound with shackles and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him and the shackles broken in pieces; and no one was strong enough to subdue him. 







###### 5 



Constantly, night and day, he was screaming among the tombs and in the mountains, and cutting himself with stones. 







###### 6 



Seeing Jesus from a distance, he ran up and bowed down before Him; 







###### 7 



and shouting with a loud voice, he *said, "[^a]What business do You have with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I implore You by God, do not torment me!" 







###### 8 



For He had _already_ been saying to him, "Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!" 







###### 9 



And He was asking him, "What is your name?" And he *said to Him, "My name is Legion, for we are many." 







###### 10 



And he begged Him earnestly not to send them out of the region. 







###### 11 



Now there was a large herd of pigs feeding [^b]nearby on the mountain. 







###### 12 



And _the demons_ begged Him, saying, "Send us into the pigs so that we may enter them." 







###### 13 



_Jesus_ gave them permission. And coming out, the unclean spirits entered the pigs; and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea, about two thousand _of them_; and they were drowned in the sea. 







###### 14 



Their herdsmen ran away and reported _it_ in the city and in the countryside. And _the people_ came to see what it was that had happened. 







###### 15 



And _then_ they *came to Jesus and *saw the man who had been demon-possessed sitting down, clothed and in his right mind, the _very_ man who had _previously_ had the "legion"; and they became frightened. 







###### 16 



Those who had seen _it_ described to them how it had happened to the demon-possessed man, and _all_ about the pigs. 







###### 17 



And they began to beg Him to leave their region. 







###### 18 



And as He was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed was begging Him that he might [^c]accompany Him. 







###### 19 



And He did not let him, but He *said to him, "Go home to your people and report to them [^d]what great things the Lord has done for you, and _how_ He had mercy on you." 







###### 20 



And he went away and began to proclaim in Decapolis [^e]what great things Jesus had done for him; and everyone was amazed. ## Miracles and Healing 







###### 21 



When Jesus had crossed over again in the boat to the other side, a large crowd gathered around Him; and He [^f]stayed by the seashore. 







###### 22 



And one of the synagogue [^g]officials, named Jairus, *came, and upon seeing Him, *fell at His feet 







###### 23 



and *pleaded with Him earnestly, saying, "My little daughter is at the point of death; _please_ come and lay Your hands on her, so that she will [^h]get well and live." 







###### 24 



And He went off with him; and a large crowd was following Him and pressing in on Him. 







###### 25 



A woman who had had a hemorrhage for twelve years, 







###### 26 



and had endured much at the hands of many physicians, and had spent all that she had and was not helped at all, but instead had become worse-- 







###### 27 



after hearing about Jesus, she came up in the crowd behind _Him_ and touched His [^i]cloak. 







###### 28 



For she had been saying _to herself_, "If I just touch His garments, I will [^j]get well." 







###### 29 



And immediately the flow of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease. 







###### 30 



And immediately Jesus, perceiving in Himself that power from Him had gone out, turned around in the crowd and said, "Who touched My garments?" 







###### 31 



And His disciples said to Him, "You see the crowd pressing in on You, and You say, 'Who touched Me?'" 







###### 32 



And He looked around to see the woman who had done this. 







###### 33 



But the woman, fearing and trembling, aware of what had happened to her, came and fell down before Him and told Him the whole truth. 







###### 34 



And He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has [^k]made you well; go in peace and be cured of your disease." 







###### 35 



While He was still speaking, _people_ *came from _the house of_ the synagogue official, saying, "Your daughter has died; why bother the Teacher further?" 







###### 36 



But Jesus, overhearing what was being spoken, *said to the synagogue official, "Do not be afraid, only [^l]believe." 







###### 37 



And He allowed no one to accompany Him except Peter, [^m]James, and John the brother of [^n]James. 







###### 38 



They *came to the house of the synagogue official, and He *saw a commotion, and _people_ loudly weeping and wailing. 







###### 39 



And after entering, He *said to them, "Why are you making a commotion and weeping? The child has not died, but is asleep." 







###### 40 



And they _began_ laughing at Him. But putting them all outside, He *took along the child's father and mother and His own companions, and *entered _the room_ where the child was _in bed_. 







###### 41 



And taking the child by the hand, He *said to her, "Talitha, kum!" (which translated means, "Little girl, I say to you, get up!"). 







###### 42 



And immediately the girl got up and _began_ to walk, for she was twelve years old. And immediately they were completely astonished. 







###### 43 



And He gave them strict orders that no one was to know about this, and He told _them_ to have _something_ given her to eat. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

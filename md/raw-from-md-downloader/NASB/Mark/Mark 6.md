# Mark 6

***








###### 1 



Jesus went out from there and *came into [^a]His hometown; and His disciples *followed Him. 







###### 2 



And when the Sabbath came, He began to teach in the synagogue; and [^b]the many listeners were astonished, saying, "Where did this man _learn_ these things, and what is _this_ wisdom that has been given to Him, and such [^c]miracles as these performed by His hands? 







###### 3 



Is this not the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of [^d]James, Joses, Judas, and Simon? And are His sisters not here with us?" And they took offense at Him. 







###### 4 



Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not dishonored except in [^e]his hometown and among his _own_ relatives, and in his _own_ household." 







###### 5 



And He could not do any [^f]miracle there except that He laid His hands on a few sick people and healed _them_. 







###### 6 



And He was amazed at their unbelief. And He was going around the villages, teaching. ## The Twelve Sent Out 







###### 7 



And He *summoned the twelve and began to send them out in pairs, and gave them authority over the unclean spirits; 







###### 8 



and He instructed them that they were to take nothing for _their_ journey, except a mere staff--no bread, no [^g]bag, no money in their belt-- 







###### 9 



but [^h]_to_ wear sandals; and _He added_, "Do not wear two [^i]tunics." 







###### 10 



And He said to them, "Wherever you enter a house, stay there until you [^j]leave town. 







###### 11 



Any place that does not receive you or listen to you, as you go out from there, shake the dust [^k]off the soles of your feet as a testimony against them." 







###### 12 



And they went out and [^l]preached that _people_ are to repent. 







###### 13 



And they were casting out many demons and were anointing with oil many sick people and healing them. ## John's Fate Recalled 







###### 14 



And King Herod heard _about it_, for His name had become well known; and _people_ were saying, "John the Baptist has risen from the dead, and that is why these miraculous powers are at work in Him." 







###### 15 



But others were saying, "He is Elijah." And others were saying, "_He is_ a prophet, like one of the prophets _of old_." 







###### 16 



But when Herod heard _about it_, he kept saying, "John, whom I beheaded, has risen!" 







###### 17 



For Herod himself had sent _men_ and had John arrested and bound in prison on account of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip, because he had married her. 







###### 18 



For John had been saying to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife." 







###### 19 



And Herodias held a grudge against him and wanted to put him to death, and could not _do so_; 







###### 20 



for Herod was afraid of John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he had been protecting him. And when he heard him, he was very perplexed; and _yet_ he [^m]used to enjoy listening to him. 







###### 21 



An opportune day came when Herod, on his birthday, held a banquet for his nobles and military commanders, and the leading people of Galilee; 







###### 22 



and when the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced, she pleased Herod and [^n]his dinner guests; and the king said to the girl, "Ask me for whatever you want, and I will give it to you." 







###### 23 



And he swore to her, "Whatever you ask of me, I will give _it_ to you, up to half of my kingdom." 







###### 24 



And she went out and said to her mother, "What shall I ask for?" And she said, "The head of John the Baptist." 







###### 25 



Immediately she came in a hurry to the king and asked, saying, "I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter." 







###### 26 



And although the king was very sorry, because of his oaths and [^o]his dinner guests, he was unwilling to refuse her. 







###### 27 



Immediately the king sent an executioner and commanded _him_ to bring _back_ his head. And he went and beheaded him in the prison, 







###### 28 



and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to her mother. 







###### 29 



When his disciples heard _about this_, they came and carried away his body, and laid it in a tomb. 







###### 30 



The apostles *gathered together with Jesus; and they reported to Him all that they had done and taught. 







###### 31 



And He *said to them, "Come _away_ by yourselves to a secluded place and rest a little while." (For there were many _people_ coming and going, and they did not even have time to eat.) 







###### 32 



And they went away in the boat to a secluded place by themselves. ## Five Thousand Men Fed 







###### 33 



_The people_ saw them going, and many recognized _them_ and ran there together on foot from all the cities, and got there ahead of them. 







###### 34 



When Jesus went [^p]ashore, He saw a large crowd, and He felt compassion for them because they were like sheep without a shepherd; and He began to teach them many things. 







###### 35 



And when it was already late, His disciples came up to Him and said, "[^q]This place is secluded and it is already late; 







###### 36 



send them away so that they may go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves [^r]something to eat." 







###### 37 



But He answered them, "You give them _something_ to eat!" And they *said to Him, "Shall we go and spend two hundred [^s]denarii on bread, and give _it_ to them to eat?" 







###### 38 



But He *said to them, "How many loaves do you have? Go look!" And when they found out, they *said, "Five, and two fish." 







###### 39 



And He ordered them all to recline by groups on the green grass. 







###### 40 



They reclined in groups of hundreds and fifties. 







###### 41 



And He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up toward heaven, He blessed _the food_ and broke the loaves and He gave _them_ to the disciples _again and again_ to set before them; and He divided the two fish among them all. 







###### 42 



And they all ate and were satisfied; 







###### 43 



and they picked up twelve full baskets of the broken pieces _of bread_, and of the fish. 







###### 44 



There were five thousand [^t]men who ate the loaves. ## Jesus Walks on the Water 







###### 45 



And immediately Jesus had His disciples get into the boat and go ahead of _Him_ to the other side, to Bethsaida, while He Himself *dismissed the crowd. 







###### 46 



And after saying goodbye to them, He left for the mountain to pray. 







###### 47 



When it was evening, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and He was alone on the land. 







###### 48 



Seeing them [^u]straining at the oars--for the wind was against them--at about the [^v]fourth watch of the night, He *came to them, walking on the sea; and He intended to pass by them. 







###### 49 



But when they saw Him walking on the sea, they thought that it was a ghost, and they cried out; 







###### 50 



for they all saw Him and were [^w]terrified. But immediately He spoke with them and *said to them, "Take courage; it is I, do not be afraid." 







###### 51 



Then He got into the boat with them, and the wind stopped; and they were utterly astonished, 







###### 52 



for they [^x]had not gained any insight from _the incident of_ the loaves, but [^y]their hearts were hardened. ## Healing at Gennesaret 







###### 53 



When they had crossed over they came to land at Gennesaret, and moored at the shore. 







###### 54 



And when they got out of the boat, immediately _the people_ recognized Him, 







###### 55 



and ran about that entire country and began carrying here and there on their pallets those who were sick, [^z]to wherever they heard He was. 







###### 56 



And wherever He entered villages, or cities, or a countryside, they were laying the sick in the marketplaces and imploring Him that they might just touch the fringe of His cloak; and all who touched it were being [^aa]healed. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

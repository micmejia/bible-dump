# Mark 7

***








###### 1 



The Pharisees and some of the scribes *gathered to Him after they came from Jerusalem, 







###### 2 



and saw that some of His disciples were eating their bread with [^a]unholy hands, that is, unwashed. 







###### 3 



(For the Pharisees and all the _other_ Jews do not eat unless they [^b]carefully wash their hands, _thereby_ holding firmly to the tradition of the elders; 







###### 4 



and _when they come_ from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they [^c]completely cleanse themselves; and there are many other things which they have received _as traditions_ to firmly hold, _such as_ the [^d]washing of cups, pitchers, and copper pots.) 







###### 5 



And the Pharisees and the scribes *asked Him, "Why do Your disciples not walk in accordance with the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with [^e]unholy hands?" 







###### 6 



But He said to them, "Rightly did Isaiah prophesy about you hypocrites, as it is written: 'This people honors Me with their lips, But their heart is far away from Me. 







###### 7 



And in vain do they worship Me, Teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.' 







###### 8 



Neglecting the commandment of God, you hold to the tradition of men." 







###### 9 



He was also saying to them, "You are experts at setting aside the commandment of God in order to keep your tradition. 







###### 10 



For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother'; and, 'The one who speaks evil of father or mother, is [^f]certainly to be put to death'; 







###### 11 



but you say, 'If a person says to his father or his mother, whatever I have that would help you is Corban (that is, [^g]given _to God_),' 







###### 12 



you no longer allow him to do anything for _his_ father or _his_ mother; 







###### 13 



_thereby_ invalidating the word of God by your tradition which you have handed down; and you do many things such as that." ## The Heart of Man 







###### 14 



After He called the crowd to Him again, He _began_ saying to them, "Listen to Me, all of you, and understand: 







###### 15 



there is nothing outside the person which can defile him if it goes into him; but the things which come out of the person are what defile the person[^h]." 







###### 17 



And when He _later_ entered a house, away from the crowd, His disciples asked Him about the parable. 







###### 18 



And He *said to them, "Are you so lacking in understanding as well? Do you not understand that whatever goes into the person from outside cannot defile him, 







###### 19 



because it does not go into his heart, but into his stomach, and [^i]is eliminated?" (_Thereby_ He declared all foods clean.) 







###### 20 



And He was saying, "That which comes out of the person, that _is what_ defiles the person. 







###### 21 



For from within, out of the [^j]hearts of people, come the evil thoughts, _acts of_ sexual immorality, thefts, murders, _acts of_ adultery, 







###### 22 



deeds of greed, wickedness, deceit, indecent behavior, [^k]envy, slander, [^l]pride, _and_ foolishness. 







###### 23 



All these evil things come from within and defile the person." ## The Syrophoenician Woman 







###### 24 



Now Jesus got up and went from there to the region of Tyre[^m]. And when He had entered a house, He wanted no one to know _about it_; and _yet_ He could not escape notice. 







###### 25 



But after hearing about Him, a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit immediately came and fell at His feet. 







###### 26 



Now the woman was a [^n]Gentile, of Syrophoenician descent. And she _repeatedly_ asked Him to cast the demon out of her daughter. 







###### 27 



And He was saying to her, "Let the children be satisfied first, for it is not [^o]good to take the children's bread and throw it to the [^p]dogs." 







###### 28 



But she answered and *said to Him, "Yes, Lord, _but_ even the dogs under the table feed on the children's crumbs." 







###### 29 



And He said to her, "Because of this [^q]answer, go; the demon has gone out of your daughter." 







###### 30 



And after going back to her home, she found the child [^r]lying on the bed, and the demon gone. 







###### 31 



Again He left the region of Tyre and came through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, within the region of Decapolis. 







###### 32 



And they *brought to Him one who was deaf and had difficulty speaking, and they *begged Him to lay His hand on him. 







###### 33 



And _Jesus_ took him aside from the crowd, by himself, and put His fingers in his ears, and after spitting, He touched his tongue _with the saliva_; 







###### 34 



and looking up to heaven with a deep sigh, He *said to him, "Ephphatha!" that is, "Be opened!" 







###### 35 



And his ears were opened, and the [^s]impediment of his tongue was [^t]removed, and he _began_ speaking plainly. 







###### 36 



And He gave them orders not to tell anyone; but the more He ordered them, the more widely they continued to proclaim _it_. 







###### 37 



And they were utterly astonished, saying, "He has done all things well; He makes even those who are deaf hear, and those who are unable to talk, speak." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

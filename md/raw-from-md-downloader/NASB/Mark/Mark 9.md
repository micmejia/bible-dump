# Mark 9

***








###### 1 



And Jesus was saying to them, "Truly I say to you, there are some of those who are standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God when it has come with power." 







###### 2 



And six days later Jesus *took with Him Peter, [^a]James, and John, and *brought them up on a high mountain by themselves. And He was [^b]transfigured before them; 







###### 3 



and His garments became radiant and exceedingly white, as no launderer on earth can whiten them. 







###### 4 



And Elijah appeared to them along with Moses; and they were talking with Jesus. 







###### 5 



Peter responded and *said to Jesus, "Rabbi, it is good that we are here; let's make three [^c]tabernacles, one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah." 







###### 6 



For he did not know how to reply; for they became terrified. 







###### 7 



Then a cloud [^d]formed, overshadowing them, and a voice [^e]came out of the cloud: "This is My beloved Son; [^f]listen to Him!" 







###### 8 



And suddenly they looked around and saw no one with them anymore, except Jesus alone. 







###### 9 



As they were coming down from the mountain, He gave them orders not to relate to anyone what they had seen, [^g]until the Son of Man rose from the dead. 







###### 10 



They [^h]seized upon [^i]that statement, discussing with one another [^j]what rising from the dead meant. 







###### 11 



And they asked Him, saying, "_Why is it_ that the scribes say that Elijah must come first?" 







###### 12 



And He said to them, "Elijah does come first and he restores all things. And _yet_ how is it written of the Son of Man that He will suffer many things and be treated with contempt? 







###### 13 



But I say to you that Elijah has [^k]indeed come, and they did to him whatever they wanted, just as it is written of him." ## All Things Possible 







###### 14 



And when they came _back_ to the _other_ disciples, they saw a large crowd around them, and _some_ scribes arguing with them. 







###### 15 



Immediately, when the entire crowd saw Him, they were amazed and _began_ running up to greet Him. 







###### 16 



And He asked them, "What are you disputing with them?" 







###### 17 



And one _person_ from the crowd answered Him, "Teacher, I brought You my son, because he has a spirit _that makes him_ unable to speak; 







###### 18 



and [^l]whenever it seizes him, it slams him to the ground, and he foams _at the mouth_ and grinds his teeth and becomes stiff. And I told Your disciples so that they would cast it out, but they could not _do it_." 







###### 19 



And He answered them and *said, "O unbelieving generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring him to Me!" 







###### 20 



And they brought [^m]the boy to Him. When he saw Him, the spirit immediately threw him into convulsions, and falling to the ground, he _began_ rolling around and foaming _at the mouth_. 







###### 21 



And He asked his father, "How long has this been happening to him?" And he said, "From childhood. 







###### 22 



It has often thrown him both into the fire and into the water to kill him. But if You can do anything, take pity on us and help us!" 







###### 23 



But Jesus said to him, "'If You can?' All things are possible for the one who believes." 







###### 24 



Immediately the boy's father cried out and said, "I do believe; help my unbelief!" 







###### 25 



When Jesus saw that a crowd was [^n]rapidly gathering, He rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, "You mute and deaf spirit, I [^o]command you, come out of him and do not enter him [^p]again!" 







###### 26 



And after crying out and throwing him into terrible convulsions, it came out; and _the boy_ became so much like a corpse that most _of them_ said, "He is dead!" 







###### 27 



But Jesus took him by the hand and raised him, and he got up. 







###### 28 



When He came into _the_ house, His disciples _began_ asking Him privately, "_Why is it_ that we could not cast it out?" 







###### 29 



And He said to them, "This kind cannot come out by anything except prayer." ## Death and Resurrection Foretold 







###### 30 



And from there they went out and _began_ to go through Galilee, and He did not want anyone to know _about it_. 







###### 31 



For He was teaching His disciples and telling them, "The Son of Man is to be [^q]handed over to men, and they will kill Him; and when He has been killed, He will rise three days later." 







###### 32 



But they [^r]did not understand _this_ statement, and they were afraid to ask Him. 







###### 33 



They came to Capernaum; and when He was in the house, He _began_ to question them: "What were you discussing on the way?" 







###### 34 



But they kept silent, for on the way they had discussed with one another which _of them was_ the greatest. 







###### 35 



And sitting down, He called the twelve and *said to them, "If anyone wants to be first, he shall be last of all and servant of all." 







###### 36 



And He took a child and placed him among them, and taking him in His arms, He said to them, 







###### 37 



"Whoever [^s]receives [^t]one child like this in My name [^u]receives Me; and whoever [^v]receives Me does not [^w]receive Me, but Him who sent Me." ## Dire Warnings 







###### 38 



John said to Him, "Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name, and we tried to prevent him because he was not following us." 







###### 39 



But Jesus said, "Do not hinder him, for there is no one who will perform a miracle in My name, and be able soon _afterward_ to speak evil of Me. 







###### 40 



For the one who is not against us is [^x]for us. 







###### 41 



For whoever gives you a cup of water to drink [^y]because of your name as _followers_ of Christ, truly I say to you, he shall by no means lose his reward. 







###### 42 



"Whoever causes one of these [^z]little ones who believe in Me to [^aa]sin, it is better for him if a heavy millstone is hung around his neck and he [^ab]is thrown into the sea. 







###### 43 



And if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off; it is better for you to enter life maimed, than, having your two hands, to go into [^ac]hell, into the unquenchable fire.[^ad] 







###### 45 



And if your foot is causing you to sin, cut it off; it is better for you to enter life without a foot, than, having your two feet, to be thrown into [^ae]hell.[^af] 







###### 47 



And if your eye is causing you to sin, throw it away; it is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye, than, having two eyes, to be thrown into [^ag]hell, 







###### 48 



where their worm does not die, and the fire is not extinguished. 







###### 49 



For everyone will be salted with fire. 







###### 50 



Salt is good; but if the salt becomes unsalty, with what will you [^ah]make it salty _again_? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

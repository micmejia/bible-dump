So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; from David to the deportation to Babylon, fourteen generations; and from the deportation to Babylon to the [^o]Messiah, fourteen generations. ## Conception and Birth of Jesus 







###### 18 



Now the birth of Jesus the [^p]Messiah was as follows: when His mother Mary had been [^q]betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be pregnant by the Holy Spirit. 







###### 19 



And her husband Joseph, since he was a righteous man and did not want to disgrace her, planned to [^r]send her away secretly. 







###### 20 



But when he had thought this over, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife; for [^s]the Child who has been conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. 







###### 21 



She will give birth to a Son; and you shall name Him Jesus, for [^t]He will save His people from their sins." 







###### 22 



Now all this [^u]took place so that what was spoken by the Lord through [^v]the prophet would be fulfilled: 







###### 23 



"Behold, the virgin will [^w]conceive and give birth to a Son, and they shall name Him [^x]Immanuel," which translated means, "God with us." 







###### 24 



And Joseph awoke from his sleep and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took _Mary_ as his wife, 







###### 25 



[^y]but kept her a virgin until she gave birth to a Son; and he named Him Jesus. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

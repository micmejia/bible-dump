# Matthew 10

***








###### 1 



_Jesus_ summoned His twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every sickness. 







###### 2 



Now the names of the twelve apostles are these: The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and his brother Andrew; and [^a]James the son of Zebedee, and his brother [^b]John; 







###### 3 



Philip and [^c]Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; [^d]James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; 







###### 4 



Simon the [^e]Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, the one who also betrayed Him. 







###### 5 



These twelve Jesus sent out after instructing them, saying, "Do not go on a road [^f]to Gentiles, and do not enter a city of Samaritans; 







###### 6 



but rather go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. 







###### 7 



And as you go, [^g]preach, saying, 'The kingdom of heaven [^h]has come near.' 







###### 8 



Heal _the_ sick, raise _the_ dead, cleanse those with leprosy, cast out demons. Freely you received, freely give. 







###### 9 



Do not acquire gold, or silver, or copper for your money belts, 







###### 10 



or a [^i]bag for _your_ journey, or even two [^j]tunics, or sandals, or a staff; for the worker is deserving of his [^k]support. 







###### 11 



And whatever city or village you enter, inquire who is worthy in it, and stay [^l]at his house until you leave _that city_. 







###### 12 



As you enter the [^m]house, give it your [^n]greeting. 







###### 13 



If the house is worthy, _see that_ your _blessing of_ peace comes upon it. But if it is not worthy, [^o]take back your _blessing of_ peace. 







###### 14 



And whoever does not receive you nor listen to your words, as you leave that house or city, shake the dust off your feet. 







###### 15 



Truly I say to you, it will be more tolerable for _the_ land of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment, than for that city. ## A Hard Road Ahead of Them 







###### 16 



"Behold, I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves; so be as wary as serpents, and as innocent as doves. 







###### 17 



But be on guard against people, for they will hand you over to _the_ courts and flog you in their synagogues; 







###### 18 



and you will even be brought before governors and kings on My account, as a testimony to them and to the Gentiles. 







###### 19 



But when they hand you over, do not worry about how or what you are to say; for what you are to say will be given you in that hour. 







###### 20 



For it is not you who are speaking, but _it is_ the Spirit of your Father who is speaking [^p]in you. 







###### 21 



"Now brother will betray brother to death, and a father _his_ child; and children will rise up against parents and [^q]cause them to be put to death. 







###### 22 



And you will be hated by all because of My name, but it is the one who has endured to the end who will be saved. 







###### 23 



"But whenever they persecute you in [^r]one city, flee to the [^s]next; for truly I say to you, you will not finish _going through_ the cities of Israel until the Son of Man comes. ## The Meaning of Discipleship 







###### 24 



"A [^t]disciple is not above his teacher, nor a slave above his master. 







###### 25 



It is enough for the disciple that he may become like his teacher, and the slave like his master. If they have called the head of the house [^u]Beelzebul, how much more _will they insult_ the members of his household! 







###### 26 



"So do not fear them, for there is nothing concealed that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known. 







###### 27 



What I tell you in the darkness, tell in the light; and what you hear _whispered_ in _your_ ear, proclaim on the housetops. 







###### 28 



And do not be afraid of those who kill the body but are unable to kill the soul; but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in [^v]hell. 







###### 29 



Are two sparrows not sold for an [^w]assarion? And _yet_ not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father. 







###### 30 



But even the hairs of your head are all counted. 







###### 31 



So do not fear; you are more valuable than a great number of sparrows. 







###### 32 



"Therefore, everyone who [^x]confesses Me before people, I will also confess [^y]him before My Father who is in heaven. 







###### 33 



But whoever denies Me before people, I will also deny him before My Father who is in heaven. 







###### 34 



"Do not think that I came to [^z]bring peace on the earth; I did not come to [^aa]bring peace, but a sword. 







###### 35 



For I came to turn a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; 







###### 36 



and a person's enemies _will be_ the members of his household. 







###### 37 



"The one who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me; and the one who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me. 







###### 38 



And the one who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me. 







###### 39 



The one who has found his [^ab]life will lose it, and the one who has lost his [^ac]life on My account will find it. ## The Reward for Service 







###### 40 



"The one who [^ad]receives you [^ae]receives Me, and the one who [^af]receives Me [^ag]receives Him who sent Me. 







###### 41 



The one who [^ah]receives a prophet in _the_ name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and the one who [^ai]receives a righteous person in the name of a righteous person shall receive a righteous person's reward. 







###### 42 



And whoever gives one of these [^aj]little ones just a cup of cold _water_ to drink in the name of a disciple, truly I say to you, he shall by no means lose his reward." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Matthew 11

***








###### 1 



When Jesus had finished [^a]giving instructions to His twelve disciples, He went on from there to teach and [^b]preach in their cities. 







###### 2 



Now _while_ in prison, John heard about the works of Christ, and he sent _word_ by his disciples, 







###### 3 



and said to Him, "Are You the Coming One, or are we to [^c]look for someone else?" 







###### 4 



Jesus answered and said to them, "Go and report to John what you hear and see: 







###### 5 



_those who are_ blind receive sight and _those who_ limp walk, _those_ with leprosy are cleansed and _those who are_ deaf hear, _the_ dead are raised, and _the_ poor have the [^d]gospel preached to them. 







###### 6 



And blessed is [^e]any person who does not [^f]take offense at Me." ## Jesus' Tribute to John 







###### 7 



As these _disciples of John_ were going _away_, Jesus began speaking to the crowds about John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? 







###### 8 



[^g]But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft _clothing_? Those who wear soft _clothing_ are in kings' [^h]palaces! 







###### 9 



[^i]But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and _one who is_ more than a prophet. 







###### 10 



This is the one about whom it [^j]is written: 'Behold, I am sending My messenger [^k]ahead of You, Who will prepare Your way before You.' 







###### 11 



Truly I say to you, among those born of women there has not arisen _anyone_ greater than John the Baptist! Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. 







###### 12 



And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has been treated violently, and violent men take it by force. 







###### 13 



For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John. 







###### 14 



And if you are willing to accept _it, John_ himself is Elijah who [^l]was to come. 







###### 15 



The one who has ears to hear, [^m]let him hear. 







###### 16 



"But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces, who call out to the other _children_, 







###### 17 



and say, 'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a song of mourning, and you did not [^n]mourn.' 







###### 18 



For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon!' 







###### 19 



The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Behold, a gluttonous man and a [^o]heavy drinker, a friend of tax collectors and [^p]sinners!' And _yet_ wisdom is vindicated by her deeds." ## The Unrepenting Cities 







###### 20 



Then He began to reprimand the cities in which most of His [^q]miracles were done, because they did not repent. 







###### 21 



"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the [^r]miracles that occurred in you had occurred in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in [^s]sackcloth and ashes. 







###### 22 



Nevertheless I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on _the_ day of judgment than for you. 







###### 23 



And you, Capernaum, will not be exalted to heaven, will you? You will be brought down to Hades! For if the [^t]miracles that occurred in you had occurred in Sodom, it would have remained to this day. 







###### 24 



Nevertheless I say to you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom on _the_ day of judgment, than for you." ## Come to Me 







###### 25 



[^u]At that time Jesus said, "I praise You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things from _the_ wise and intelligent, and have revealed them to infants. 







###### 26 



Yes, Father, for this way was well pleasing in Your sight. 







###### 27 



All things have been handed over to Me by My Father; and no one knows the Son except the Father; nor does anyone know the Father except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son determines to reveal _Him_. 







###### 28 



"Come to Me, all [^v]who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. 







###### 29 



Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find [^w]rest for your souls. 







###### 30 



For My yoke is comfortable, and My burden is light." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Matthew 14

***








###### 1 



[^a]At that time [^b]Herod [^c]the tetrarch heard the news about Jesus, 







###### 2 



and said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist; he himself has been raised from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him." 







###### 3 



For when Herod had John arrested, he bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip. 







###### 4 



For John had been saying to him, "It is not lawful for you to have her." 







###### 5 



Although Herod wanted to put him to death, he feared the crowd, because they regarded [^d]John as a prophet. 







###### 6 



But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced [^e]before _them_ and pleased Herod, 







###### 7 



so _much_ that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked. 







###### 8 



And after being prompted by her mother, she *said, "Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter." 







###### 9 



And although he was grieved, the king commanded _it_ to be given because of his oaths and [^f]his dinner guests. 







###### 10 



He sent _word_ and had John beheaded in the prison. 







###### 11 



And his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought _it_ to her mother. 







###### 12 



[^g]John's disciples came and took away the body and buried [^h]it; and they went and reported to Jesus. ## Five Thousand Men Fed 







###### 13 



Now when Jesus heard _about John_, He withdrew from there in a boat to a secluded place by Himself; and when the [^i]people heard _about this_, they followed Him on foot from the cities. 







###### 14 



When He came [^j]ashore, He saw a large crowd, and felt compassion for them and healed their sick. 







###### 15 



Now when it was evening, the disciples came to Him and said, "This place is secluded and the hour is already past _to eat_; send the crowds away, so that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves." 







###### 16 



But Jesus said to them, "They do not need to go; you give them _something_ to eat!" 







###### 17 



They *said to Him, "We have nothing here except five loaves and two fish." 







###### 18 



And He said, "Bring them here to Me." 







###### 19 



And ordering the crowds to [^k]sit down on the grass, He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looked up toward heaven. He blessed _the food_ and breaking the loaves, He gave them to the disciples, and the disciples _gave them_ to the crowds. 







###### 20 



And they all ate and were satisfied, and they picked up what was left over of the broken pieces: twelve full baskets. 







###### 21 



There were about five thousand men who ate, besides women and children. ## Jesus Walks on the Water 







###### 22 



Immediately _afterward_ He compelled the disciples to get into the boat and to go ahead of Him to the other side, while He sent the crowds away. 







###### 23 



After He had sent the crowds away, He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray; and when it was evening, He was there alone. 







###### 24 



But the boat was already [^l]a long distance from the land, [^m]battered by the waves; for the wind was [^n]contrary. 







###### 25 



And in the [^o]fourth watch of the night He came to them, walking on the sea. 







###### 26 



When the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were terrified, and said, "It is a ghost!" And they cried out [^p]in fear. 







###### 27 



But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, "Take courage, [^q]it is I; do not be afraid." 







###### 28 



Peter responded and said to Him, "Lord, if [^r]it is You, command me to come to You on the water." 







###### 29 



And He said, "Come!" And Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water, and came toward Jesus. 







###### 30 



But seeing the wind, he became frightened, and when he began to sink, he cried out, saying, "Lord, save me!" 







###### 31 



Immediately Jesus reached out with His hand and took hold of him, and *said to him, "You of little faith, why did you doubt?" 







###### 32 



When they got into the boat, the wind stopped. 







###### 33 



And those who were in the boat worshiped Him, saying, "You are truly God's Son!" 







###### 34 



When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret. 







###### 35 



And when the men of that place [^s]recognized Him, they sent _word_ into all that surrounding region and brought to Him all who were sick; 







###### 36 



and they pleaded with Him that they might just touch the [^t]border of His cloak; and all who touched _it_ were cured. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Matthew 15

***








###### 1 



Then _some_ Pharisees and scribes *came to Jesus from Jerusalem and said, 







###### 2 



"Why do Your disciples break the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread." 







###### 3 



And He answered and said to them, "Why do you yourselves also break the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition? 







###### 4 



For God said, 'Honor your father and mother,' and, 'The one who speaks evil of father or mother is to [^a]be put to death.' 







###### 5 



But you say, 'Whoever says to _his_ father or mother, "Whatever I have that would help you has been [^b]given _to God_," 







###### 6 



he is not to [^c]honor his father _or mother_.' And _by this_ you have invalidated the word of God for the sake of your tradition. 







###### 7 



You hypocrites, rightly did Isaiah prophesy about you, by saying: 







###### 8 



'This people honors Me with their lips, But their heart is far away from Me. 







###### 9 



And in vain do they worship Me, Teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.'" 







###### 10 



After Jesus called the crowd to Him, He said to them, "Hear and understand! 







###### 11 



_It is_ not what enters the mouth _that_ defiles the person, but what comes out of the mouth, this defiles the person." 







###### 12 



Then the disciples came and *said to Him, "Do You know that the Pharisees were [^d]offended when they heard this statement?" 







###### 13 



But He answered and said, "Every plant which My heavenly Father did not plant will be uprooted. 







###### 14 



Leave them alone; they are blind guides [^e]of blind people. And if a person who is blind guides _another_ who is blind, both will fall into a pit." ## The Heart of Man 







###### 15 



Peter [^f]said to Him, "Explain the parable to us." 







###### 16 



[^g]Jesus said, "Are you also still lacking in understanding? 







###### 17 



Do you not understand that everything that goes into the mouth passes into the stomach, and is [^h]eliminated? 







###### 18 



But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and those things defile the person. 







###### 19 



For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, _acts of_ adultery, _other_ immoral sexual acts, thefts, false testimonies, _and_ [^i]slanderous statements. 







###### 20 



These are the things that defile the person; but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile the person." ## The Faith of a Canaanite Woman 







###### 21 



Jesus went away from there, and withdrew into the region of Tyre and Sidon. 







###### 22 



And a Canaanite woman from that region came out and _began_ to cry out, saying, "Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David; my daughter is severely demon-possessed." 







###### 23 



But He did not answer her _with even_ a word. And His disciples came up and urged Him, saying, "Send her away, because she keeps shouting [^j]at us!" 







###### 24 



But He answered and said, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel." 







###### 25 



But she came and _began_ [^k]to bow down before Him, saying, "Lord, help me!" 







###### 26 



Yet He answered and said, "It is not [^l]good to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs." 







###### 27 



And she said, "Yes, Lord; _but please help_, for even the dogs feed on the crumbs that fall from their masters' table." 







###### 28 



Then Jesus said to her, "O woman, your faith is great; it shall be done for you as you desire." And her daughter was healed [^m]at once. ## Healing Crowds 







###### 29 



Departing from there, Jesus went along the Sea of Galilee, and after going up on the mountain, He was sitting there. 







###### 30 



And [^n]large crowds came to Him bringing with them _those who were_ limping, had impaired limbs, _were_ blind, _or were_ unable to speak, and many others, and they laid them down at His feet; and He healed them. 







###### 31 



So the crowd was astonished as they saw those who were unable to speak talking, those with impaired limbs [^o]restored, those who were limping walking around, and those who were blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel. ## Four Thousand Men Fed 







###### 32 



Now Jesus called His disciples to Him and said, "I feel compassion for the [^p]people, because they [^q]have remained with Me now for three days and have nothing to eat; and I do not want to send them away hungry, for they might faint on the way." 







###### 33 



The disciples *said to Him, "Where would we get so many loaves in _this_ desolate place to satisfy such a large crowd?" 







###### 34 



And Jesus *said to them, "How many loaves do you have?" And they said, "Seven, and a few small fish." 







###### 35 



And He directed the [^r]people to [^s]sit down on the ground; 







###### 36 



and He took the seven loaves and the fish; and after giving thanks, He broke them and started giving them to the disciples, and the disciples _gave them_ to the crowds. 







###### 37 



And they all ate and were satisfied, and they picked up what was left over of the broken pieces, seven large baskets full. 







###### 38 



And those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children. 







###### 39 



And sending away the crowds, Jesus got into the boat and came to the region of Magadan. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

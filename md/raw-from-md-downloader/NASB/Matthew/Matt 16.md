# Matthew 16

***








###### 1 



The Pharisees and Sadducees came up, and putting _Jesus_ to the test, they asked Him to show them a [^a]sign from heaven. 







###### 2 



But He replied to them, "[^b]When it is evening, you say, '_It will be_ fair weather, for the sky is red.' 







###### 3 



And in the morning, '_There will be_ a storm today, for the sky is red and threatening.' You know how to discern the [^c]appearance of the sky, but are you unable _to discern_ the signs of the times? 







###### 4 



An evil and adulterous generation wants a [^d]sign; and _so_ a [^e]sign will not be given to it, except the sign of Jonah." And He left them and went away. 







###### 5 



And the disciples came to the other side _of the sea_, but they had forgotten to bring _any_ bread. 







###### 6 



And Jesus said to them, "Watch out and beware of the [^f]leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees." 







###### 7 



They began to discuss _this_ among themselves, saying, "_He said that_ because we did not bring _any_ bread." 







###### 8 



But Jesus, aware _of this_, said, "You men of little faith, why are you discussing among yourselves _the fact_ that you have no bread? 







###### 9 



Do you not yet understand nor remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets you picked up? 







###### 10 



Nor the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many large baskets you picked up? 







###### 11 



How _is it that_ you do not understand that I did not speak to you about bread? But beware of the [^g]leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees." 







###### 12 



Then they understood that He did not say to beware of the [^h]leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. ## Peter's Confession of Christ 







###### 13 



Now when Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi, He was asking His disciples, "Who do people say that the Son of Man is?" 







###### 14 



And they said, "Some _say_ John the Baptist; and others, [^i]Elijah; and _still_ others, [^j]Jeremiah, or one of the _other_ prophets." 







###### 15 



He *said to them, "But who do you yourselves say that I am?" 







###### 16 



Simon Peter answered, "You are the [^k]Christ, the Son of the living God." 







###### 17 



And Jesus said to him, "Blessed are you, Simon [^l]Barjona, because flesh and blood did not reveal _this_ to you, but My Father who is in heaven. 







###### 18 



And I also say to you that you are [^m]Peter, and upon this [^n]rock I will build My church; and the gates of Hades will not overpower it. 







###### 19 



I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever you [^o]bind on earth [^p]shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you [^q]loose on earth [^r]shall have been loosed in heaven." 







###### 20 



Then He gave the disciples strict orders that they were to tell no one that He was the [^s]Christ. ## Jesus Foretells His Death 







###### 21 



From that time [^t]Jesus began to [^u]point out to His disciples that it was necessary for Him to go to Jerusalem and to suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and to be killed, and to be raised up on the third day. 







###### 22 



And _yet_ Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, "[^v]God forbid it, Lord! This shall never [^w]happen to You!" 







###### 23 



But He turned and said to Peter, "Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me; for you are not setting your mind on [^x]God's purposes, but men's." ## Discipleship Is Costly 







###### 24 



Then Jesus said to His disciples, "If anyone wants to come after Me, he must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow Me. 







###### 25 



For whoever wants to save his [^y]life will lose it; but whoever loses his [^z]life for My sake will find it. 







###### 26 



For what good will it do a person if he gains the whole world, but [^aa]forfeits his soul? Or what will a person give in exchange for his soul? 







###### 27 



For the Son of Man is going to come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and will then repay every person according to his [^ab]deeds. 







###### 28

# Matthew 17

***








###### 1 



Six days later, Jesus *took with Him Peter and [^a]James, and his brother John, and *led them up on a high mountain by themselves. 







###### 2 



And He was transfigured before them; and His face shone like the sun, and His garments became as white as light. 







###### 3 



And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Him. 







###### 4 



Peter responded and said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good that we are here. If You want, I will make three [^b]tabernacles here: one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah." 







###### 5 



While he was still speaking, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and behold, a voice from the cloud said, "This is My beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to Him!" 







###### 6 



When the disciples heard _this_, they fell [^c]face down to the ground and were terrified. 







###### 7 



And Jesus came to _them_ and touched them and said, "Get up, and do not be afraid." 







###### 8 



And raising their eyes, they saw no one except Jesus Himself alone. 







###### 9 



When they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, "Tell the vision to no one until the Son of Man has risen from the dead." 







###### 10 



And His disciples asked Him, "Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?" 







###### 11 



And He answered and said, "Elijah is coming and will restore all things; 







###### 12 



but I say to you that Elijah already came, and they did not recognize him, but did [^d]to him whatever they wanted. So also the Son of Man is going to suffer [^e]at their hands." 







###### 13 



Then the disciples understood that He had spoken to them about John the Baptist. ## The Demon-possessed Boy 







###### 14 



When they came to the crowd, a man came up to [^f]Jesus, falling on his knees before Him and saying, 







###### 15 



"[^g]Lord, have mercy on my son, because he has seizures and suffers terribly; for he often falls into the fire and often into the water. 







###### 16 



And I brought him to Your disciples, and they could not cure him." 







###### 17 



And Jesus answered and said, "You unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring him here to Me." 







###### 18 



And Jesus rebuked him, and the demon came out of him, and the boy was healed [^h]at once. 







###### 19 



Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, "Why could we not cast it out?" 







###### 20 



And He *said to them, "Because of your meager faith; for truly I say to you, if you have faith [^i]the size of a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you.[^j]" 







###### 22 



And while they were gathering together in Galilee, Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be [^k]handed over to men; 







###### 23 



and they will kill Him, and He will be raised on the third day." And they were deeply grieved. ## The Temple Tax 







###### 24 



Now when they came to Capernaum, those who collected the [^l]two-drachma _tax_ came to Peter and said, "Does your teacher not pay the [^m]two-drachma _tax_?" 







###### 25 



He *said, "Yes." And when he came into the house, Jesus spoke to him first, saying, "What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth collect customs or [^n]poll-tax, from their sons or from strangers?" 







###### 26 



When _Peter_ said, "From strangers," Jesus said to him, "Then the sons are [^o]exempt. 







###### 27 



However, so that we do not offend them, go to the sea and throw in a hook, and take the first fish that comes up; and when you open its mouth, you will find a [^p]stater. Take that and give it to them for you and Me." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

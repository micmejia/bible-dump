# Matthew 18

***








###### 1 



At that [^a]time the disciples came to Jesus and said, "Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?" 







###### 2 



And He called a child to Himself and set him among them, 







###### 3 



and said, "Truly I say to you, unless you [^b]change and become like children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven. 







###### 4 



So whoever will humble himself like this child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. 







###### 5 



And whoever receives one such child in My name, receives Me; 







###### 6 



but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to [^c]sin, it is better for him that a [^d]heavy millstone be hung around his neck, and that he be drowned in the depths of the sea. ## Stumbling Blocks 







###### 7 



"Woe to the world because of _its_ [^e]stumbling blocks! For it is inevitable that [^f]stumbling blocks come; but woe to the person through whom the [^g]stumbling block comes! 







###### 8 



"And if your hand or your foot is causing you to sin, cut it off and throw it away from you; it is better for you to enter life maimed or without a foot, than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into the eternal fire. 







###### 9 



And if your eye is causing you to sin, tear it out and throw it away from you. It is better for you to enter life with one eye, than to have two eyes and be thrown into the [^h]fiery hell. 







###### 10 



"See that you do not look down on one of these little ones; for I say to you that their angels in heaven continually see the face of My Father who is in heaven.[^i] ## Ninety-nine Plus One 







###### 12 



"What do you think? If any man has a hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains, and go and search for the one that is lost? 







###### 13 



And if it turns out that he finds it, truly I say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that have not gone astray. 







###### 14 



So it is not _the_ will [^j]of your Father who is in heaven for one of these little ones to perish. ## Discipline and Prayer 







###### 15 



"Now if your brother sins[^k], go and [^l]show him his fault [^m]in private; if he listens to you, you have gained your brother. 







###### 16 



But if he does not listen _to you_, take one or two more with you, so that on the [^n]testimony of two or three witnesses every [^o]matter may be confirmed. 







###### 17 



And if he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, he is to be to you as [^p]a Gentile and [^q]a tax collector. 







###### 18 



Truly I say to you, whatever you [^r]bind on earth [^s]shall have been bound in heaven; and whatever you [^t]loose on earth [^u]shall have been loosed in heaven. 







###### 19 



"Again I say to you, that if two of you agree on earth about anything that they may ask, it shall be done for them [^v]by My Father who is in heaven. 







###### 20 



For where two or three have gathered together in My name, I am there in their midst." ## Forgiveness 







###### 21 



Then Peter came up and said to Him, "Lord, how many times shall my brother sin against me and I _still_ forgive him? Up to seven times?" 







###### 22 



Jesus *said to him, "I do not say to you, up to seven times, but up to [^w]seventy-seven times. 







###### 23 



"For this reason the kingdom of heaven [^x]is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his slaves. 







###### 24 



And when he had begun to settle _them_, one who owed him [^y]ten thousand talents was brought to him. 







###### 25 



But since he [^z]did not have _the means_ to repay, his master commanded that he be sold, along with his wife and children and all that he had, and repayment be made. 







###### 26 



So the slave fell _to the ground_ and prostrated himself before him, saying, 'Have patience with me and I will repay you everything.' 







###### 27 



And the master of that slave felt compassion, and he released him and forgave him the [^aa]debt. 







###### 28 



But that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred [^ab]denarii; and he seized him and _began_ to choke _him_, saying, 'Pay back what you owe!' 







###### 29 



So his fellow slave fell _to the ground_ and _began_ to plead with him, saying, 'Have patience with me and I will repay you.' 







###### 30 



But he was unwilling, [^ac]and went and threw him in prison until he would pay back what was owed. 







###### 31 



So when his fellow slaves saw what had happened, they were deeply grieved and came and reported to their master all that had happened. 







###### 32 



Then summoning him, his master *said to him, 'You wicked slave, I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me. 







###### 33 



Should you not also have had mercy on your fellow slave, in the same way that I had mercy on you?' 







###### 34 



And his master, moved with anger, handed him over to the [^ad]torturers until he would repay all that was owed him. 







###### 35 



My heavenly Father will also do the same to you, if each of you does not forgive his brother from your [^ae]heart." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Matthew 19

***








###### 1 



When Jesus had finished these words, He left Galilee and came into the region of Judea beyond the Jordan; 







###### 2 



and [^a]large crowds followed Him, and He healed them there. 







###### 3 



_Some_ Pharisees came to [^b]Jesus, testing Him and [^c]asking, "Is it lawful _for a man_ to [^d]divorce his wife for any reason _at all_?" 







###### 4 



And He answered and said, "Have you not read that He who created _them_ from the beginning made them male and female, 







###### 5 



and said, 'For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh'? 







###### 6 



So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has joined together, no person is to separate." 







###### 7 



They *said to Him, "Why, then, did Moses command to give _her_ a certificate of divorce and send her away?" 







###### 8 



He *said to them, "Because of your hardness of heart Moses permitted you to [^e]divorce your wives; but from the beginning it has not been this way. 







###### 9 



And I say to you, whoever [^f]divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman [^g]commits adultery[^h]." 







###### 10 



The disciples *said to Him, "If the relationship of the man with his wife is like this, it is better not to marry." 







###### 11 



But He said to them, "Not all men _can_ accept this statement, but _only_ those to whom it has been given. 







###### 12 



For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother's womb; and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by people; and there are _also_ eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. The one who is able to accept _this_, let him accept _it_." ## Jesus Blesses Little Children 







###### 13 



Then _some_ children were brought to Him so that He would lay His hands on them and pray; and the disciples rebuked them. 







###### 14 



But Jesus said, "[^i]Leave the children alone, and do not [^j]forbid them to come to Me; for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these." 







###### 15 



After laying His hands on them, He departed from there. ## The Rich Young Ruler 







###### 16 



And someone came to Him and said, "Teacher, what good thing shall I do so that I may obtain eternal life?" 







###### 17 



And He said to him, "Why are you asking Me about what is good? There is _only_ One who is good; but if you want to enter life, keep the commandments." 







###### 18 



_Then_ he *said to Him, "Which ones?" And Jesus said, "You shall not commit murder; You shall not commit adultery; You shall not steal; You shall not give false testimony; 







###### 19 



Honor your father and mother; and You shall love your neighbor as yourself." 







###### 20 



The young man *said to Him, "All these I have kept; what am I still lacking?" 







###### 21 



Jesus said to him, "If you want to be [^k]complete, go _and_ sell your possessions and give to _the_ poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me." 







###### 22 



But when the young man heard this statement, he went away grieving; for he was one who owned much property. 







###### 23 



And Jesus said to His disciples, "Truly I say to you, it will be hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven. 







###### 24 



And again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God." 







###### 25 



When the disciples heard _this_, they were very astonished and said, "Then who can be saved?" 







###### 26 



And looking at _them_, Jesus said to them, "With people this is impossible, but with God all things are possible." ## The Disciples' Reward 







###### 27 



Then Peter responded and said to Him, "Behold, we have left everything and followed You; what then will there be for us?" 







###### 28 



And Jesus said to them, "Truly I say to you, that you who have followed Me, in the [^l]regeneration when the Son of Man will sit on [^m]His glorious throne, you also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. 







###### 29 



And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother [^n]or children or farms on account of My name, will receive [^o]many times as much, and will inherit eternal life.

But many _who are_ first will be last; and _the_ last, first. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

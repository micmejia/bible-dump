# Matthew 2

***








###### 1 



Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, [^a]magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem, saying, 







###### 2 



"Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we saw His star in the east and have come to worship Him." 







###### 3 



When Herod the king heard _this_, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. 







###### 4 



And gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the [^b]Messiah was to be born. 







###### 5 



They said to him, "In Bethlehem of Judea; for this is what has been written [^c]by [^d]the prophet: 







###### 6 



'And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah, Are by no means least among the leaders of Judah; For from you will come forth a Ruler Who will shepherd My people Israel.'" 







###### 7 



Then Herod secretly called for the magi and determined from them the exact [^e]time the star appeared. 







###### 8 



And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and search carefully for the Child; and when you have found _Him_, report to me, so that I too may come and worship Him." 







###### 9 



After hearing the king, they went on their way; and behold, the star, which they had seen in the east, went on ahead of them until it came to a stop over _the place_ where the Child was _to be found_. 







###### 10 



When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy. 







###### 11 



And after they came into the house, they saw the Child with His mother Mary; and they fell down and [^f]worshiped Him. Then they opened their treasures and presented to Him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. 







###### 12 



And after being warned _by God_ in a dream not to return to Herod, _the magi_ left for their own country by another way. ## The Escape to Egypt 







###### 13 



Now when they had gone, behold, an angel of the Lord *appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, "Get up! Take the Child and His mother and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you; for Herod is going to search for the Child to kill Him." 







###### 14 



So [^g]Joseph got up and took the Child and His mother while it was still night, and left for Egypt. 







###### 15 



He [^h]stayed there until the death of Herod; _this happened_ so that what had been spoken by the Lord through [^i]the prophet would be fulfilled: "Out of Egypt I called My Son." ## Herod Slaughters Babies 







###### 16 



Then when Herod saw that he had been tricked by the magi, he became very enraged, and sent _men_ and killed all the boys who were in Bethlehem and all its vicinity [^j]who were two years old or under, according to the time which he had determined from the magi. 







###### 17 



Then what had been spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: 







###### 18 



"A voice was heard in Ramah, Weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children; And she refused to be comforted, Because they were no more." 







###### 19 



But when Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord *appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, and said, 







###### 20 



"Get up, take the Child and His mother, and go to the land of Israel; for those who sought the Child's life are dead." 







###### 21 



So [^k]Joseph got up, took the Child and His mother, and came into the land of Israel. 







###### 22 



But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Then after being warned _by God_ in a dream, he left for the regions of Galilee, 







###### 23 



and came and settled in a city called Nazareth. _This happened_ so that what was spoken through the prophets would be fulfilled: "He will be called a Nazarene." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

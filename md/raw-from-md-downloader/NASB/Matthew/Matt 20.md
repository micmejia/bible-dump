# Matthew 20

***








###### 1 



"For the kingdom of heaven is like [^a]a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard. 







###### 2 



When he had agreed with the laborers for a [^b]denarius for the day, he sent them into his vineyard. 







###### 3 



And he went out about the [^c]third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace; 







###### 4 



and to those he said, 'You go into the vineyard also, and whatever is right, I will give you.' And _so_ they went. 







###### 5 



Again he went out about the [^d]sixth and the ninth hour, and did [^e]the same thing. 







###### 6 



And about the [^f]eleventh _hour_ he went out and found others standing _around_; and he *said to them, 'Why have you been standing here idle all day long?' 







###### 7 



They *said to him, 'Because no one hired us.' He *said to them, 'You go into the vineyard too.' 







###### 8 



"Now when evening came, the [^g]owner of the vineyard *said to his foreman, 'Call the laborers and pay them their wages, starting with the last _group_ to the first.' 







###### 9 



When those _hired_ about the eleventh hour came, each one received a [^h]denarius. 







###### 10 



And _so_ when those _hired_ first came, they thought that they would receive more; [^i]but each of them also received a denarius. 







###### 11 



When they received it, they grumbled at the landowner, 







###### 12 



saying, 'These who _were hired_ last worked _only_ one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day's _work_ and the scorching heat.' 







###### 13 



But he answered and said to one of them, 'Friend, I am doing you no wrong; did you not agree with me for a denarius? 







###### 14 



Take what is yours and go; but I want to give to this last person the same as to you. 







###### 15 



Is it not lawful for me to do what I want with what is my own? Or is your eye [^j]envious because I am [^k]generous?' 







###### 16 



So the last shall be first, and the first, last." ## Death, Resurrection Foretold 







###### 17 



As Jesus was about to go up to Jerusalem, He took the twelve _disciples_ aside by themselves, and on the road He said to them, 







###### 18 



"Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be [^l]handed over to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn Him to death, 







###### 19 



and they will hand Him over to the Gentiles to mock and flog and crucify, and on the third day He will be raised up." ## Request for Preferred Treatment 







###### 20 



Then the mother of the [^m]sons of Zebedee came to [^n]Jesus with her sons, bowing down and making a request of Him. 







###### 21 



And He said to her, "What do you desire?" She *said to Him, "Say that in Your kingdom these two sons of mine shall sit, one at Your right, and one at Your left." 







###### 22 



But Jesus replied, "You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?" They *said to Him, "We are able." 







###### 23 



He *said to them, "My cup you shall drink; but to sit at My right and at _My_ left is not Mine to give, but _it is for those_ for whom it has been prepared by My Father." 







###### 24 



And after hearing _this_, the _other_ ten _disciples_ became indignant with the two brothers. 







###### 25 



But Jesus called them to Himself and said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles domineer over them, and [^o]those in high position exercise authority over them. 







###### 26 



It [^p]is not this way among you, but whoever wants to become [^q]prominent among you shall be your servant, 







###### 27 



and whoever desires to be first among you shall be your slave; 







###### 28 



just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His [^r]life as a ransom for many." ## Sight for Those Who Are Blind 







###### 29 



As they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed Him. 







###### 30 



And two people who were blind, sitting by the road, hearing that Jesus was passing by, cried out, "Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!" 







###### 31 



But the crowd sternly warned them to be quiet; yet they cried out all the more, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!" 







###### 32 



And Jesus stopped and called them, and said, "What do you want Me to do for you?" 







###### 33 



They *said to Him, "Lord, _we want_ our eyes to be opened." 







###### 34 



Moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes; and immediately they regained their sight and followed Him. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

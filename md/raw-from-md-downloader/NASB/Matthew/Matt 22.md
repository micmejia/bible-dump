# Matthew 22

***








###### 1 



Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying, 







###### 2 



"The kingdom of heaven [^a]is like [^b]a king who [^c]held a wedding feast for his son. 







###### 3 



And he sent his slaves to call those who had been invited to the wedding feast, and they were unwilling to come. 







###### 4 



Again he sent other slaves, saying, 'Tell those who have been invited, "Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and my fattened cattle are _all_ butchered and everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast!"' 







###### 5 



But they paid no attention and went their _separate_ ways, one to his own [^d]farm, another to his business, 







###### 6 



and the rest seized his slaves and treated them abusively, and _then_ killed them. 







###### 7 



Now the king was angry, and he sent his armies and destroyed those murderers and set their city on fire. 







###### 8 



Then he *said to his slaves, 'The wedding feast is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy. 







###### 9 



So go to the main roads, and invite whomever you find _there_ to the wedding feast.' 







###### 10 



Those slaves went out into the streets and gathered together all whom they found, both bad and good; and the wedding hall was filled with [^e]dinner guests. 







###### 11 



"But when the king came in to look over the [^f]dinner guests, he saw a man there who was not dressed in wedding clothes, 







###### 12 



and he *said to him, 'Friend, how did you get in here without wedding clothes?' And the man was speechless. 







###### 13 



Then the king said to the servants, 'Tie his hands and feet, and throw him into the outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth in that place.' 







###### 14 



For many are [^g]called, but few _are_ chosen." ## Poll-tax to Caesar 







###### 15 



Then the Pharisees went and [^h]plotted together how they might trap Him [^i]in what He said. 







###### 16 



And they *sent their disciples to Him, along with the Herodians, saying, "Teacher, we know that You are truthful and teach the way of God in truth, and [^j]do not care what anyone thinks; for You [^k]are not partial to anyone. 







###### 17 



Tell us then, what do You think? Is it [^l]permissible to pay a [^m]poll-tax to Caesar, or not?" 







###### 18 



But Jesus perceived their [^n]malice, and said, "Why are you testing Me, you hypocrites? 







###### 19 



Show Me the coin _used_ for the poll-tax." And they brought Him a [^o]denarius. 







###### 20 



And He *said to them, "Whose image and inscription is this?" 







###### 21 



They *said to Him, "Caesar's." Then He *said to them, "Then pay to Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and to God the things that are God's." 







###### 22 



And hearing _this_, they were amazed; and they left Him and went away. ## Jesus Answers the Sadducees 







###### 23 



On that day _some_ Sadducees (who say there is no resurrection) came to [^p]Jesus and questioned Him, 







###### 24 



saying, "Teacher, Moses said, 'If a man dies having no children, his brother as next of kin shall marry his wife, and raise up [^q]children for his brother.' 







###### 25 



Now there were seven brothers among us; and the first married and died, and having no [^r]children, he left his wife to his brother. 







###### 26 



_It was_ the same also _with_ the second _brother_, and the third, down to the seventh. 







###### 27 



Last of all, the woman died. 







###### 28 



In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife of the seven will she be? For they all had her _in marriage_." 







###### 29 



But Jesus answered and said to them, "You are mistaken, since you do not [^s]understand the Scriptures nor the power of God. 







###### 30 



For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven. 







###### 31 



But regarding the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God: 







###### 32 



'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living." 







###### 33 



When the crowds heard _this_, they were astonished at His teaching. 







###### 34 



But when the Pharisees heard that _Jesus_ had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together. 







###### 35 



And one of them, [^t]a lawyer, asked Him a question, testing Him: 







###### 36 



"Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?" 







###### 37 



And He said to him, "'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.' 







###### 38 



This is the great and [^u]foremost commandment. 







###### 39 



The second is like it, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' 







###### 40 



Upon these two commandments [^v]hang the whole Law and the Prophets." 







###### 41 



Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question: 







###### 42 



"What do you think about the [^w]Christ? Whose son is He?" They *said to Him, "_The son_ of David." 







###### 43 



He *said to them, "Then [^x]how does David [^y]in the Spirit call Him 'Lord,' saying, 







###### 44 



'The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at My right hand, Until I put Your enemies under Your feet"'? 







###### 45 



Therefore, if David calls Him 'Lord,' [^z]how is He his son?" 







###### 46 



No one was able to offer Him a word in answer, nor did anyone dare from that day _on_ to ask Him any more questions. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

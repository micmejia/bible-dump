# Matthew 23

***








###### 1 



Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to His disciples, 







###### 2 



saying: "The scribes and the Pharisees have seated themselves in the chair of Moses. 







###### 3 



Therefore, whatever they tell you, do and [^a]comply with it all, but do not do [^b]as they do; for they say _things_ and do not do _them_. 







###### 4 



And they tie up heavy burdens and lay them on people's shoulders, but they themselves are unwilling to move them with _so much as_ their finger. 







###### 5 



And they do all their deeds to be noticed by _other_ people; for they broaden their [^c]phylacteries and lengthen the tassels _of their garments_. 







###### 6 



And they love the place of honor at banquets, and the seats of honor in the synagogues, 







###### 7 



and personal greetings in the marketplaces, and being called [^d]Rabbi by the people. 







###### 8 



But as for you, do not be called [^e]Rabbi; for _only_ One is your Teacher, and you are all brothers _and sisters_. 







###### 9 



And do not call _anyone_ on earth your father; for _only_ One is your Father, He who is in heaven. 







###### 10 



And do not be called [^f]leaders; for _only_ One is your Leader, _that is_, Christ. 







###### 11 



But the greatest of you shall be your servant. 







###### 12 



Whoever exalts himself shall be humbled, and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted. ## Eight Woes 







###### 13 



"But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you shut the kingdom of heaven in front of people; for you do not enter _it_ yourselves, nor do you allow those who are entering to go in.[^g] 







###### 15 



"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you travel around on sea and land to make one [^h]proselyte; and when he becomes _one_, you [^i]make him twice as much a son of [^j]hell as yourselves. 







###### 16 



"Woe to you, blind guides, who say, 'Whoever swears by the [^k]temple, _that_ is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the [^l]temple is obligated.' 







###### 17 



You fools and blind men! Which is [^m]more important, the gold or the [^n]temple that sanctified the gold? 







###### 18 



And _you say_, 'Whoever swears by the altar, _that_ is nothing; but whoever swears by the [^o]offering that is on it is obligated.' 







###### 19 



You blind men, which is [^p]more important, the [^q]offering or the altar that sanctifies the [^r]offering? 







###### 20 



Therefore, the one who swears by the altar, swears _both_ by [^s]the altar and by everything on it. 







###### 21 



And the one who swears by the [^t]temple, swears _both_ by [^u]the temple and by Him who dwells in it. 







###### 22 



And the one who swears by [^v]heaven, swears _both_ by the throne of God and by Him who sits upon it. 







###### 23 



"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and dill and [^w]cumin, and have neglected the weightier provisions of the Law: justice and mercy and faithfulness; but these _are the things_ you should have done without neglecting the others. 







###### 24 



You blind guides, who [^x]strain out a gnat and swallow a camel! 







###### 25 



"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside they are full [^y]of robbery and self-indulgence. 







###### 26 



You blind Pharisee, first clean the inside of the cup and of the dish, so that the [^z]outside of it may also become clean. 







###### 27 



"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs which on the outside appear beautiful, but inside they are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness. 







###### 28 



So you too, outwardly appear righteous to people, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness. 







###### 29 



"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs for the prophets and decorate the monuments of the righteous, 







###### 30 



and you say, 'If we had been _living_ in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partners with them in _shedding_ the blood of the prophets.' 







###### 31 



So you testify against yourselves, that you are [^aa]sons of those who murdered the prophets. 







###### 32 



[^ab]Fill up, then, the measure _of the guilt_ of your fathers. 







###### 33 



You snakes, you [^ac]offspring of vipers, how [^ad]will you escape the [^ae]sentence of [^af]hell? 







###### 34 



"Therefore, behold, I am sending you prophets and wise men and scribes; some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will flog in your synagogues, and persecute from city to city, 







###### 35 



so that upon you will fall _the guilt of_ all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the [^ag]temple and the altar. 







###### 36 



Truly I say to you, all these things will come upon this generation. ## Grieving over Jerusalem 







###### 37 



"Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who have been sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, the way a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were unwilling. 







###### 38 



Behold, your house is being left to you desolate! 







###### 39 



For I say to you, from now on you will not see Me until you say, 'Blessed is the One who comes in the name of the Lord!'" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

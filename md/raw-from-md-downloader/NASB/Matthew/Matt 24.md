# Matthew 24

***








###### 1 



Jesus left the temple _area_ and was going _on His way_ [^a]when His disciples came up to point out the temple buildings to Him. 







###### 2 



But He responded and said to them, "Do you not see all these things? Truly I say to you, not _one_ stone here will be left upon another, which will not be torn down." 







###### 3 



And as He was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, "Tell us, when will these things happen, and what _will be_ the sign of Your coming, and of the [^b]end of the age?" 







###### 4 



And Jesus answered and said to them, "See to it that no one [^c]misleads you. 







###### 5 



For many will come in My name, saying, 'I am the [^d]Christ,' and they will [^e]mislead many people. 







###### 6 



And you will be hearing of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not alarmed, for _those things_ must take place, but _that_ is not yet the end. 







###### 7 



For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places. 







###### 8 



But all these things are _merely_ the beginning of birth pains. 







###### 9 



"Then they will hand you over to tribulation and kill you, and you will be hated by all nations because of My name. 







###### 10 



And at that time many will [^f]fall away, and they will [^g]betray one another and hate one another. 







###### 11 



And many false prophets will rise up and [^h]mislead many people. 







###### 12 



And because lawlessness is increased, [^i]most people's love will become cold. 







###### 13 



But the one who endures to the end is the one who will be saved. 







###### 14 



This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole [^j]world as a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come. ## Perilous Times 







###### 15 



"Therefore when you see the abomination of desolation which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place--[^k]let the [^l]reader understand-- 







###### 16 



then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains. 







###### 17 



[^m]Whoever is on the [^n]housetop must not go down to get things out of his house. 







###### 18 



And [^o]whoever is in the field must not turn back to get his cloak. 







###### 19 



But woe to those women who are pregnant, and to those who are nursing babies in those days! 







###### 20 



Moreover, pray that [^p]when you flee, it will not be in the winter, or on a Sabbath. 







###### 21 



For then there will be a great tribulation, such as has not occurred since the beginning of the world until now, nor ever will _again_. 







###### 22 



And if those days had not been cut short, no [^q]life would have been saved; but for the sake of the [^r]elect those days will be cut short. 







###### 23 



Then if anyone says to you, 'Behold, here is the [^s]Christ,' or '_He is over_ here,' do not believe _him_. 







###### 24 



For false christs and false prophets will arise and will provide great [^t]signs and wonders, so as to mislead, if possible, even the [^u]elect. 







###### 25 



Behold, I have told you in advance. 







###### 26 



So if they say to you, 'Behold, He is in the wilderness,' do not go out; _or_, 'Behold, He is in the inner rooms,' do not believe _them_. 







###### 27 



For just as the lightning comes from the east and flashes as far as the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man [^v]be. 







###### 28 



Wherever the corpse is, there the [^w]vultures will gather. ## The Glorious Return 







###### 29 



"But immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. 







###### 30 



And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory. 







###### 31 



And He will send forth His angels with a great trumpet blast, and they will gather together His [^x]elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other. ## Parable of the Fig Tree 







###### 32 



"Now learn the parable from the fig tree: as soon as its branch has become tender and sprouts its leaves, you know that summer is near; 







###### 33 



so you too, when you see all these things, [^y]recognize that [^z]He is near, _right_ at the [^aa]door. 







###### 34 



Truly I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place. 







###### 35 



Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away. 







###### 36 



"But about that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone. 







###### 37 



For [^ab]the coming of the Son of Man will be just like the days of Noah. 







###### 38 



For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, 







###### 39 



and they did not [^ac]understand until the flood came and took them all away; so will the coming of the Son of Man be. 







###### 40 



At that time there will be two _men_ in the field; one [^ad]will be taken and one [^ae]will be left. 







###### 41 



Two _women_ will be grinding at the [^af]mill; one [^ag]will be taken and one [^ah]will be left. ## Be Ready for His Coming 







###### 42 



"Therefore be on the alert, for you do not know which day your Lord is coming. 







###### 43 



But [^ai]be sure of this, that if the head of the house had known at what time of the night the thief was coming, he would have been on the alert and would not have allowed his house to be broken into. 







###### 44 



For this reason you must be ready as well; for the Son of Man is coming at an hour when you do not think _He will_. 







###### 45 



"Who then is the faithful and sensible slave whom his [^aj]master put in charge of his household slaves, to give them their food at the proper time? 







###### 46 



Blessed is that slave whom his [^ak]master finds so doing when he comes. 







###### 47 



Truly I say to you that he will put him in charge of all his possessions. 







###### 48 



But if that evil slave says in his heart, 'My [^al]master [^am]is not coming for a long time,' 







###### 49 



and he begins to beat his fellow slaves, and he eats and drinks with those habitually drunk; 







###### 50 



_then_ the [^an]master of that slave will come on a day that he does not expect, and at an hour that he does not know, 







###### 51 



and he will [^ao]cut him in two and assign [^ap]him a place with the hypocrites; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

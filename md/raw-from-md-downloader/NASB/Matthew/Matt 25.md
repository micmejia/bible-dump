# Matthew 25

***








###### 1 



"Then the kingdom of heaven will be comparable to ten virgins, who took their lamps and went out to meet the groom. 







###### 2 



Five of them were foolish, and five were prudent. 







###### 3 



For when the foolish took their lamps, they did not take _extra_ oil with them; 







###### 4 



but the prudent ones took oil in flasks with their lamps. 







###### 5 



Now while the groom was delaying, they all became drowsy and _began_ to sleep. 







###### 6 



But at midnight [^a]there finally was a shout: 'Behold, the groom! Come out to meet _him_.' 







###### 7 



Then all those virgins got up and trimmed their lamps. 







###### 8 



But the foolish _virgins_ said to the prudent ones, 'Give us some of your oil, because our lamps are going out.' 







###### 9 



However, the prudent ones answered, '_No_, there most certainly would not be enough for us and you _too_; go instead to the merchants and buy _some_ for yourselves.' 







###### 10 



But while they were [^b]on their way to buy _the oil_, the groom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast; and the door was shut. 







###### 11 



Yet later, the other virgins also came, saying, 'Lord, lord, open up for us.' 







###### 12 



But he answered, 'Truly I say to you, I do not know you.' 







###### 13 



Be on the alert then, because you do not know the day nor the hour. ## Parable of the Talents 







###### 14 



"For _it is_ just like a man _about_ to go on a journey, _who_ called his own slaves and entrusted his possessions to them. 







###### 15 



To one he gave five [^c]talents, to another, two, and to another, one, each according to his own ability; and he went on his journey. 







###### 16 



The one who had received the five talents immediately went and did business with them, and earned five more _talents_. 







###### 17 



In the same way the one who _had received_ the two _talents_ earned two more. 







###### 18 



But he who received the one _talent_ went away and dug _a hole in the_ ground, and hid his [^d]master's money. 







###### 19 



"Now after a long time the master of those slaves *came and *settled accounts with them. 







###### 20 



The one who had received the five talents came up and brought five more talents, saying, 'Master, you entrusted five talents to me. See, I have earned five more talents.' 







###### 21 



His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful slave. You were faithful with a few things, I will put you in charge of many things; enter the joy of your [^e]master.' 







###### 22 



"Also the one who _had received_ the two talents came up and said, 'Master, you entrusted two talents to me. See, I have earned two more talents.' 







###### 23 



His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful slave. You were faithful with a few things, I will put you in charge of many things; enter the joy of your master.' 







###### 24 



"Now the one who had received the one talent also came up and said, 'Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter _seed_. 







###### 25 



And I was afraid, so I went away and hid your talent in the ground. See, you _still_ have what is yours.' 







###### 26 



"But his master answered and said to him, 'You [^f]worthless, lazy slave! Did you know that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I did not scatter _seed_? 







###### 27 



Then you ought to have [^g]put my money in the bank, and [^h]on my arrival I would have received my _money_ back with interest. 







###### 28 



Therefore: take the talent away from him, and give it to the one who has the ten talents.' 







###### 29 



"For to everyone who has, _more_ shall be given, and he will have an abundance; but from the one who does not have, even what he does have shall be taken away. 







###### 30 



And throw the worthless slave into the outer darkness; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. ## The Judgment 







###### 31 



"But when the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the angels with Him, then He will sit on His glorious throne. 







###### 32 



And all the nations will be gathered before Him; and He will separate them from one another, just as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats; 







###### 33 



and He will put the sheep on His right, but the goats on the left. 







###### 34 



"Then the King will say to those on His right, 'Come, you who are blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. 







###### 35 



For I was hungry, and you gave Me _something_ to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave Me _something_ to drink; I was a stranger, and you invited Me in; 







###### 36 



naked, and you clothed Me; I was sick, and you visited Me; I was in prison, and you came to Me.' 







###### 37 



Then the righteous will answer Him, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry, and feed You, or thirsty, and give You _something_ to drink? 







###### 38 



And when did we see You _as_ a stranger, and invite You in, or naked, and clothe You? 







###### 39 



And when did we see You sick, or in prison, and come to You?' 







###### 40 



And the King will answer and say to them, 'Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did _it_ for one of the least of these brothers _or sisters_ of Mine, you did _it_ for Me.' 







###### 41 



"Then He will also say to those on His left, 'Depart from Me, you accursed people, into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels; 







###### 42 



for I was hungry, and you gave Me nothing to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave Me nothing to drink; 







###### 43 



I was a stranger, and you did not invite Me in; naked, and you did not clothe Me; sick, and in prison, and you did not visit Me.' 







###### 44 



Then they themselves also will answer, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry, or thirsty, or _as_ a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not [^i]take care of You?' 







###### 45 



Then He will answer them, 'Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did not do _it_ for one of the least of these, you did not do _it_ for Me, either.' 







###### 46 



These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

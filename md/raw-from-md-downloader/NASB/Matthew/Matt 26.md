# Matthew 26

***








###### 1 



When Jesus had finished all these words, He said to His disciples, 







###### 2 



"You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man is _to be_ handed over for crucifixion." 







###### 3 



At that time the chief priests and the elders of the people were gathered together in the courtyard of the high priest named Caiaphas; 







###### 4 



and they plotted together to arrest Jesus covertly and kill Him. 







###### 5 



But they were saying, "Not during the festival, otherwise a riot might occur among the people." ## The Precious Ointment 







###### 6 



Now when Jesus was in Bethany, at the home of Simon [^a]the Leper, 







###### 7 



a woman came to Him with an alabaster vial of very expensive perfume, and she poured it on His head as He was reclining _at the table_. 







###### 8 



But the disciples were indignant when they saw _this_, and said, "Why this waste? 







###### 9 



For this _perfume_ could have been sold for a high price and _the money_ given to the poor." 







###### 10 



But Jesus, aware of this, said to them, "Why are you bothering the woman? For she has done a good deed for Me. 







###### 11 



For you always have the poor with you; but you do not always have Me. 







###### 12 



For when she poured this perfume on My body, she did it to prepare Me for burial. 







###### 13 



Truly I say to you, wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be told in memory of her." ## Judas' Bargain 







###### 14 



Then one of the twelve, named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests 







###### 15 



and said, "What are you willing to give me [^b]to [^c]betray Him to you?" And they set _out_ for him thirty [^d]pieces of silver. 







###### 16 



And from then on he looked for a good opportunity to [^e]betray [^f]Jesus. 







###### 17 



Now on the first _day_ of [^g]Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus and [^h]asked, "Where do You want us to prepare for You to eat the Passover?" 







###### 18 



And He said, "Go into the city to a certain man, and say to him, 'The Teacher says, "My time is near; I am keeping the Passover at your house with My disciples."'" 







###### 19 



The disciples did as Jesus had directed them; and they prepared the Passover. ## The Last Passover 







###### 20 



Now when evening came, Jesus was reclining _at the table_ with the [^i]twelve. 







###### 21 



And as they were eating, He said, "Truly I say to you that one of you will betray Me." 







###### 22 



Being deeply grieved, they began saying to Him, each one: "Surely it is not I, Lord?" 







###### 23 



And He answered, "He who dipped his hand with Me in the bowl is the one who will betray Me. 







###### 24 



The Son of Man is going away just as it is written about Him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good [^j]for that man if he had not been born." 







###### 25 



And Judas, who was betraying Him, said, "Surely it is not I, Rabbi?" Jesus *said to him, "You have said _it_ yourself." ## The Lord's Supper Instituted 







###### 26 



Now while they were eating, Jesus took _some_ bread, and [^k]after a blessing, He broke _it_ and gave _it_ to the disciples, and said, "Take, eat; this is My body." 







###### 27 



And when He had taken a cup and given thanks, He gave _it_ to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you; 







###### 28 



for this is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for forgiveness of sins. 







###### 29 



But I say to you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it with you, new, in My Father's kingdom." 







###### 30 



And after singing a [^l]hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. 







###### 31 



Then Jesus *said to them, "You will all [^m]fall away because of Me this night, for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.' 







###### 32 



But after I have been raised, I will go ahead of you to Galilee." 







###### 33 



But Peter replied to Him, "_Even_ if they all [^n]fall away because of You, I will never fall away!" 







###### 34 



Jesus said to him, "Truly I say to you that this _very_ night, before a rooster crows, you will deny Me three times." 







###### 35 



Peter *said to Him, "Even if I have to die with You, I will not deny You!" All the disciples said the same thing as well. ## The Garden of Gethsemane 







###### 36 



Then Jesus *came with them to a place called [^o]Gethsemane, and *told His disciples, "Sit here while I go over there and pray." 







###### 37 



And He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with Him, and began to be grieved and distressed. 







###### 38 



Then He *said to them, "My soul is deeply grieved, to the point of death; remain here and keep watch with Me." 







###### 39 



And He went a little beyond _them_, and fell on His face and prayed, saying, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; yet not as I will, but as You _will_." 







###### 40 



And He *came to the disciples and *found them sleeping, and He *said to Peter, "So, you _men_ could not keep watch with Me for one hour? 







###### 41 



Keep watching and praying, so that you do not come into temptation; the spirit is [^p]willing, but the flesh is weak." 







###### 42 



He went away again a second time and prayed, saying, "My Father, if this _cup_ cannot pass away unless I drink _from_ it, Your will be done." 







###### 43 



Again He came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. 







###### 44 



And He left them again, and went away and prayed a third time, saying the same thing once more. 







###### 45 



Then He *came to the disciples and *said to them, "[^q]Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour [^r]is at hand and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners. 







###### 46 



Get up, let's go; behold, the one who is betraying Me is near!" ## Jesus' Betrayal and Arrest 







###### 47 



And while He was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came [^s]accompanied by a large crowd with swords and clubs, _who came_ from the chief priests and elders of the people. 







###### 48 



Now he who was betraying Him gave them a sign _previously_, saying, "Whomever I kiss, He is _the one_; arrest Him." 







###### 49 



And immediately _Judas_ went up to Jesus and said, "Greetings, Rabbi!" and kissed Him. 







###### 50 



But Jesus said to him, "Friend, _do_ what you have come for." Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and arrested Him. 







###### 51 



And behold, one of those who were with Jesus [^t]reached and drew his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest and [^u]cut off his ear. 







###### 52 



Then Jesus *said to him, "Put your sword back into its place; for all those who take up the sword will perish by the sword. 







###### 53 



Or do you think that I cannot appeal to My Father, and He will at once put at My disposal more than twelve [^v]legions of angels? 







###### 54 



How then would the Scriptures be fulfilled, _which say_ that it must happen this way?" 







###### 55 



At that time Jesus said to the crowds, "Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest Me as _you would_ against a man inciting a revolt? Every day I used to sit within the temple _grounds_ teaching, and you did not arrest Me. 







###### 56 



But all this has taken place so that the Scriptures of the prophets will be fulfilled." Then all the disciples left Him and fled. ## Jesus before Caiaphas 







###### 57 



Those who had arrested Jesus led Him away to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together. 







###### 58 



But Peter was following Him at a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest, and he came inside and sat down with the [^w]officers to see the outcome. 







###### 59 



Now the chief priests and the entire [^x]Council kept trying to obtain false testimony against Jesus, so that they might put Him to death. 







###### 60 



They did not find _any_, even though many false witnesses came forward. But later on two came forward, 







###### 61 



and said, "This man stated, 'I am able to destroy the [^y]temple of God and to rebuild it [^z]in three days.'" 







###### 62 



The high priest stood up and said to Him, "Do You offer no answer for what these men are testifying against You?" 







###### 63 



But Jesus kept silent. And the high priest said to Him, "I place You under oath by the living God, to tell us whether You are the [^aa]Christ, the Son of God." 







###### 64 



Jesus *said to him, "You have said _it_ yourself. But I tell you, from now _on_ you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of power, and coming on the clouds of heaven." 







###### 65 



Then the high priest tore his [^ab]robes and said, "He has blasphemed! What further need do we have of witnesses? See, you have now heard the blasphemy; 







###### 66 



what do you think?" They answered, "He deserves death!" 







###### 67 



Then they spit in His face and beat Him with their fists; and others [^ac]slapped Him, 







###### 68 



and said, "Prophesy to us, You [^ad]Christ; who is the one who hit You?" ## Peter's Denials 







###### 69 



Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a slave woman came to him and said, "You too were with Jesus the Galilean." 







###### 70 



But he denied _it_ before them all, saying, "I do not know what you are talking about." 







###### 71 



When he had gone out to the gateway, another _slave woman_ saw him and *said to those who were there, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth." 







###### 72 



And again he denied _it_, with an oath: "I do not know the man." 







###### 73 



A little later the bystanders came up and said to Peter, "You really are _one_ of them as well, since even the way you talk [^ae]gives you away." 







###### 74 



Then he began to curse and swear, "I do not know the man!" And immediately a rooster crowed. 







###### 75 



And Peter remembered the statement that Jesus had [^af]made: "Before a rooster crows, you will deny Me three times." And he went out and wept bitterly. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

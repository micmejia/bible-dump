# Matthew 27

***








###### 1 



Now when morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people conferred together against Jesus to put Him to death; 







###### 2 



and they bound Him and led Him away, and handed Him over to Pilate the governor. 







###### 3 



Then when Judas, who had betrayed Him, saw that He had been condemned, he felt remorse and returned the thirty [^a]pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, 







###### 4 



saying, "I have sinned by betraying innocent blood." But they said, "What _is that_ to us? You shall see _to it_ yourself!" 







###### 5 



And he threw the pieces of silver into the temple sanctuary and left; and he went away and hanged himself. 







###### 6 



The chief priests took the pieces of silver and said, "It is not lawful to put them in the temple treasury, since it is money paid for blood." 







###### 7 



And they conferred together and [^b]with the money bought the Potter's Field as a burial place for strangers. 







###### 8 



For this reason that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day. 







###### 9 



Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: "And [^c]they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of the One whose price had been set by the sons of Israel; 







###### 10 



and [^d]they gave them for the Potter's Field, just as the Lord directed me." ## Jesus before Pilate 







###### 11 



Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor questioned Him, saying, "_So_ You are the King of the Jews?" And Jesus said to him, "_It is as_ you say." 







###### 12 



And while He was being accused by the chief priests and elders, He did not offer any answer. 







###### 13 



Then Pilate *said to Him, "Do You not hear how many things they are testifying against You?" 







###### 14 



And _still_ He did not answer him in regard to even a single [^e]charge, so the governor was greatly amazed. 







###### 15 



Now at _the Passover_ Feast the governor was accustomed to release for the [^f]people _any_ one prisoner whom they wanted. 







###### 16 



And at that time they were holding a notorious prisoner called Barabbas. 







###### 17 



So when the people gathered together, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release for you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?" 







###### 18 



For he knew that _it was_ because of envy _that_ [^g]they had handed Him over. 







###### 19 



And while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him _a message_, saying, "_See that you have_ nothing _to do_ with that righteous Man; for [^h]last night I suffered greatly in a dream because of Him." 







###### 20 



But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas, and to put Jesus to death. 







###### 21 



And the governor [^i]said to them, "Which of the two do you want me to release for you?" And they said, "Barabbas." 







###### 22 



Pilate *said to them, "Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?" They all *said, "[^j]Crucify Him!" 







###### 23 



But he said, "Why, what evil has He done?" Yet they kept shouting all the more, saying, "[^k]Crucify Him!" 







###### 24 



Now when Pilate saw that he was accomplishing nothing, but rather that a riot was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of this Man's blood; you yourselves shall see." 







###### 25 



And all the people replied, "His blood _shall be_ on us and on our children!" 







###### 26 



Then he released Barabbas [^l]for them; but after having Jesus flogged, he handed Him over to be crucified. ## Jesus Is Mocked 







###### 27 



Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the [^m]Praetorium and gathered the whole _Roman_ [^n]cohort to Him. 







###### 28 



And they stripped Him and put a red [^o]cloak on Him. 







###### 29 



And after twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on His head, and _put_ a [^p]reed in His right hand; and they knelt down before Him and mocked Him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!" 







###### 30 



And they spit on Him, and took the reed and beat Him on the head. 







###### 31 



And after they had mocked Him, they took the cloak off Him and put His _own_ garments back on Him, and led Him away to crucify _Him_. 







###### 32 



As they were coming out, they found a man of Cyrene named Simon, [^q]whom they compelled to carry His [^r]cross. ## The Crucifixion 







###### 33 



And when they came to a place called Golgotha, which means Place of a Skull, 







###### 34 



they gave Him wine mixed with [^s]bile to drink; and after tasting _it_, He was unwilling to drink _it_. 







###### 35 



And when they had crucified Him, they divided His garments among themselves by casting [^t]lots. 







###### 36 



And sitting down, they _began_ to keep watch over Him there. 







###### 37 



And above His head they put up the charge against Him [^u]which read, "THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS." 







###### 38 



At that time two [^v]rebels *were being crucified with Him, one on the right and one on the left. 







###### 39 



And those passing by were [^w]speaking abusively to Him, shaking their heads, 







###### 40 



and saying, "You who _are going to_ destroy the temple and rebuild _it_ in three days, save Yourself! If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross." 







###### 41 



In the same way the chief priests also, along with the scribes and elders, were mocking _Him_ and saying, 







###### 42 



"He saved others; [^x]He cannot save Himself! He is the King of Israel; let Him now come down from the cross, and we will believe in Him. 







###### 43 



He has trusted in God; let God rescue _Him_ now, if He [^y]takes pleasure in Him; for He said, 'I am the Son of God.'" 







###### 44 



And the [^z]rebels who had been crucified with Him were also insulting Him in the same _way_. 







###### 45 



Now from the [^aa]sixth hour darkness [^ab]fell upon all the land until the [^ac]ninth hour. 







###### 46 



And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lema sabaktanei?" that is, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" 







###### 47 



And some of those who were standing there, when they heard it, said, "This man is calling for Elijah." 







###### 48 



And immediately one of them ran, and taking a sponge, he filled it with sour wine and put it on a reed, and gave Him a drink. 







###### 49 



But the rest _of them_ said, "[^ad]Let us see if Elijah comes to save Him[^ae]." 







###### 50 



And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and gave up His spirit. 







###### 51 



And behold, the [^af]veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom; and the earth shook and the rocks were split. 







###### 52 



Also the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the [^ag]saints who had fallen asleep were raised; 







###### 53 



and coming out of the tombs after His resurrection, they entered the holy city and appeared to many. 







###### 54 



Now as for the centurion and those who were with him keeping guard over Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the _other_ things that were happening, they became extremely frightened and said, "Truly this was [^ah]the Son of God!" 







###### 55 



And many women were there watching from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee while caring for Him. 







###### 56 



Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. ## Jesus Is Buried 







###### 57 



Now when it was evening, a rich man from Arimathea came, named Joseph, who himself had also become a disciple of Jesus. 







###### 58 



This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given _to him_. 







###### 59 



And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, 







###### 60 



and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut out in the rock; and he rolled a large stone against the entrance of the tomb and went away. 







###### 61 



And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb. 







###### 62 



Now on the next day, _that is, the day_ which is after the preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together with Pilate, 







###### 63 



and they said, "Sir, we remember that when that deceiver was still alive, He said, 'After three days I am rising.' 







###### 64 



Therefore, give orders for the tomb to be made secure until the third day; otherwise, His disciples may come and steal Him, and say to the people, 'He has risen from the dead,' and the last deception will be worse than the first." 







###### 65 



Pilate said to them, "You have a guard; go, make it _as_ secure as you know how." 







###### 66 



And they went and made the tomb secure with the guard, sealing the stone. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

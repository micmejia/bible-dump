# Matthew 28

***








###### 1 



Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first _day_ of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to look at the tomb. 







###### 2 



And behold, a severe earthquake had occurred, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled away the stone, and sat upon it. 







###### 3 



And his appearance was like lightning, and his clothing as white as snow. 







###### 4 



The guards shook from fear of him and became like dead men. 







###### 5 



And the angel said to the women, "[^a]Do not be afraid; for I know that you are looking for Jesus who has been crucified. 







###### 6 



He is not here, for He has risen, just as He said. Come, see the place where He was lying. 







###### 7 



And go quickly and tell His disciples that He has risen from the dead; and behold, He is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see Him; behold, I have told you." 







###### 8 



And they left the tomb quickly with fear and great joy, and ran to report to His disciples. 







###### 9 



And behold, Jesus met them [^b]and said, "[^c]Rejoice!" And they came up and took hold of His feet, and worshiped Him. 







###### 10 



Then Jesus *said to them, "[^d]Do not be afraid; go, bring word to My brothers to leave for Galilee, and there they will see Me." 







###### 11 



Now while they were on their way, some of the _men from the_ guard came into the city and reported to the chief priests all that had happened. 







###### 12 



And when they had assembled with the elders and consulted together, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers, 







###### 13 



and said, "You are to say, 'His disciples came at night and stole Him while we were asleep.' 







###### 14 



And if this comes to the governor's ears, we will appease him and [^e]keep you out of trouble." 







###### 15 



And they took the money and did as they had been instructed; and this story was widely spread among the Jews _and is_ to this day. ## The Great Commission 







###### 16 



But the eleven disciples proceeded to Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus had designated to them. 







###### 17 



And when they saw Him, they worshiped _Him_; but some [^f]were doubtful. 







###### 18 



And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me. 







###### 19 



[^g]Go, therefore, and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, 







###### 20 



teaching them to [^h]follow all that I commanded you; and behold, I am with you [^i]always, to the end of the age." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

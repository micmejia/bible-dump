# Matthew 3

***








###### 1 



Now in those days John the Baptist *[^a]came, [^b]preaching in the wilderness of Judea, saying, 







###### 2 



"Repent, for the kingdom of heaven [^c]is at hand." 







###### 3 



For this is the one referred to [^d]by Isaiah the prophet when he said, "The voice of one [^e]calling [^f]out in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way of the Lord, Make His paths straight!'" 







###### 4 



Now John himself had [^g]a garment of camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey. 







###### 5 



At that time Jerusalem was going out to him, and all Judea and all the region around the Jordan; 







###### 6 



and they were being baptized by him in the Jordan River, as they confessed their sins. 







###### 7 



But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for [^h]baptism, he said to them, "You [^i]offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? 







###### 8 



Therefore produce fruit consistent with repentance; 







###### 9 



and do not assume that you can say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham _as our_ father'; for I tell you that God is able, from these stones, to raise up children for Abraham. 







###### 10 



And the axe is already laid at the root of the trees; therefore, every tree that does not bear good fruit is being cut down and thrown into the fire. 







###### 11 



"As for me, I baptize you [^j]with water for repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, and I am not fit to remove His sandals; He will baptize you [^k]with the Holy Spirit and fire. 







###### 12 



His winnowing fork is in His hand, and He will thoroughly clear His threshing floor; and He will gather His wheat into the barn, but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire." ## The Baptism of Jesus 







###### 13 



Then Jesus *arrived from Galilee at the Jordan, _coming_ to John to be baptized by him. 







###### 14 



But John tried to prevent Him, saying, "I have _the_ need to be baptized by You, and _yet_ You are coming to me?" 







###### 15 



But Jesus, answering, said to him, "Allow _it_ at this time; for in this way it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then he *allowed Him. 







###### 16 



After He was baptized, Jesus came up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened, and [^l]he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove _and_ [^m]settling on Him, 







###### 17 



and behold, a voice from the heavens said, "This is [^n]My beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Matthew 4

***








###### 1 



Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. 







###### 2 



And after He had fasted for forty days and forty nights, He [^a]then became hungry. 







###### 3 



And the tempter came and said to Him, "If You are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread." 







###### 4 



But He answered and said, "It is written: 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes out of the mouth of God.'" 







###### 5 



Then the devil *took Him along into the holy city and had Him stand on the pinnacle of the temple, 







###### 6 



and he *said to Him, "If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down; for it is written: 'He will give His angels orders concerning You'; and 'On _their_ hands they will lift You up, So that You do not strike Your foot against a stone.'" 







###### 7 



Jesus said to him, "[^b]On the other hand, it is written: 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'" 







###### 8 



Again, the devil *took Him along to a very high mountain and *showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory; 







###### 9 



and he said to Him, "All these things I will give You, if You fall down and [^c]worship me." 







###### 10 



Then Jesus *said to him, "Go away, Satan! For it is written: 'You shall worship the Lord your God, and [^d]serve Him only.'" 







###### 11 



Then the devil *left Him; and behold, angels came and _began to_ serve Him. ## Jesus Begins His Ministry 







###### 12 



Now when Jesus heard that John had been taken into custody, He withdrew into Galilee; 







###### 13 



and leaving Nazareth, He came and settled in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali. 







###### 14 



_This happened_ so that what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet would be fulfilled: 







###### 15 



"The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, [^e]By the way of the sea, on the other side of the Jordan, Galilee of the [^f]Gentiles-- 







###### 16 



The people who were sitting in darkness saw a great Light, And those who were sitting in the land and shadow of death, Upon them a Light dawned." 







###### 17 



From that time Jesus began to [^g]preach and say, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven [^h]is at hand." ## The First Disciples 







###### 18 



Now as _Jesus_ was walking by the Sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers, Simon, who was called Peter, and his brother Andrew, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen. 







###### 19 



And He *said to them, "[^i]Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of people." 







###### 20 



Immediately they left their nets and followed Him. 







###### 21 



Going on from there He saw two other brothers, [^j]James the _son_ of Zebedee, and his brother [^k]John, in the boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets; and He called them. 







###### 22 



Immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed Him. ## Ministry in Galilee 







###### 23 



Jesus was going about in all of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the [^l]gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people. 







###### 24 



And the news about Him spread throughout Syria; and they brought to Him all who were ill, those suffering with various diseases and severe pain, demon-possessed, people with epilepsy, and people who were paralyzed; and He healed them. 







###### 25 



Large crowds followed Him from Galilee and _the_ Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and _from_ beyond the Jordan. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Matthew 5

***








###### 1 



Now when Jesus saw the crowds, He went up on the [^a]mountain; and after He sat down, His disciples came to Him. 







###### 2 



And He opened His mouth and _began_ to teach them, saying, 







###### 3 



"[^b]Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 







###### 4 



"Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted. 







###### 5 



"Blessed are the [^c]gentle, for they will inherit the earth. 







###### 6 



"Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be satisfied. 







###### 7 



"Blessed are the merciful, for they will receive mercy. 







###### 8 



"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God. 







###### 9 



"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of God. 







###### 10 



"Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 







###### 11 



"Blessed are you when _people_ insult you and persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of Me. 







###### 12 



Rejoice and be glad, for your reward in heaven is great; for in this same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you. ## Disciples and the World 







###### 13 



"You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt has become tasteless, how [^d]can it be made salty _again_? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by people. 







###### 14 



"You are the light of the world. A city set on a [^e]hill cannot be hidden; 







###### 15 



nor do _people_ light a lamp and put it under a [^f]basket, but on the lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house. 







###### 16 



Your light must shine before people in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven. 







###### 17 



"Do not presume that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill. 







###### 18 



For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not [^g]the smallest letter or stroke of a letter shall pass from the Law, until all is accomplished! 







###### 19 



Therefore, whoever nullifies one of the least of these commandments, and teaches [^h]others _to do_ the same, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever [^i]keeps and teaches _them_, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. 







###### 20 



"For I say to you that unless your righteousness far surpasses _that_ of the scribes and Pharisees, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven. ## Personal Relationships 







###### 21 



"You have heard that [^j]the ancients were told, 'You shall not murder,' and 'Whoever commits murder shall be answerable to the court.' 







###### 22 



But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be answerable to the court; and whoever says to his brother, '[^k]You good-for-nothing,' shall be answerable to [^l]the supreme court; and whoever says, 'You fool,' shall be guilty _enough to go_ into the [^m]fiery hell. 







###### 23 



Therefore, if you are presenting your [^n]offering at the altar, and there you remember that your brother has something against you, 







###### 24 



leave your [^o]offering there before the altar and go; first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and present your [^p]offering. 







###### 25 



[^q]Come to good terms with your accuser quickly, while you are with him on the way _to court_, so that your accuser will not hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you will not be thrown into prison. 







###### 26 



Truly I say to you, you will not come out of there until you have paid up the last [^r]quadrans. 







###### 27 



"You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery'; 







###### 28 



but I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. 







###### 29 



Now if your right eye is causing you to sin, tear it out and throw it away from you; for it is better for you to lose one of the parts of your _body_, [^s]than for your whole body to be thrown into [^t]hell. 







###### 30 



And if your right hand is causing you to sin, cut it off and throw it away from you; for it is better for you [^u]to lose one of the parts of your _body_, [^v]than for your whole body to go into [^w]hell. 







###### 31 



"Now it was said, 'Whoever sends his wife away is to give her a certificate of divorce'; 







###### 32 



but I say to you that everyone who [^x]divorces his wife, except for _the_ reason of sexual immorality, makes her commit adultery; and whoever marries a [^y]divorced woman commits adultery. 







###### 33 



"Again, you have heard that [^z]the ancients were told, '[^aa]You shall not [^ab]make false vows, but shall fulfill your [^ac]vows to the Lord.' 







###### 34 



But I say to you, take no oath at all, neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God, 







###### 35 



nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of His feet, nor [^ad]by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. 







###### 36 



Nor shall you take an oath by your head, for you cannot make a single hair white or black. 







###### 37 



But make sure your statement is, '[^ae]Yes, yes' _or_ 'No, no'; anything beyond these is [^af]of evil _origin_. 







###### 38 



"You have heard that it was said, 'Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.' 







###### 39 



But I say to you, do not show opposition against an evil person; but whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other toward him also. 







###### 40 



And if anyone wants to sue you and take your [^ag]tunic, let him have your [^ah]cloak also. 







###### 41 



Whoever [^ai]forces you to go one mile, go with him two. 







###### 42 



Give to him who asks of you, and do not turn away from him who wants to borrow from you. 







###### 43 



"You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' 







###### 44 



But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, 







###### 45 



so that you may prove yourselves to be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for He causes His sun to rise on _the_ evil and _the_ good, and sends rain on _the_ righteous and _the_ unrighteous. 







###### 46 



For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Even the tax collectors, do they not do the same? 







###### 47 



And if you greet only your brothers _and sisters_, what more are you doing _than others_? Even the Gentiles, do they not do the same? 







###### 48 



Therefore you shall be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

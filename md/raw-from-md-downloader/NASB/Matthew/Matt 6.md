# Matthew 6

***








###### 1 



"Take care not to practice your righteousness in the sight of people, to be noticed by them; otherwise you have no reward with your Father who is in heaven. 







###### 2 



"So when you [^a]give to the poor, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, so that they will be praised by people. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full. 







###### 3 



But when you [^b]give to the poor, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, 







###### 4 



so that your charitable giving will be in secret; and your Father who sees _what is done_ in secret will reward you. 







###### 5 



"And when you pray, you are not to be like the hypocrites; for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on the street corners so that they [^c]will be seen by people. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full. 







###### 6 



But as for you, when you pray, go into your inner room, close your door, and pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees _what is done_ in secret will reward you. 







###### 7 



"And when you are praying, do not use thoughtless repetition as the Gentiles do, for they think that they will be heard because of their many words. 







###### 8 



So do not be like them; for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him. ## The Lord's Prayer 







###### 9 



"Pray, then, in this way: 'Our Father, who is in heaven, [^d]Hallowed be Your name. 







###### 10 



[^e]Your kingdom come. Your will be done, [^f]On earth as it is in heaven. 







###### 11 



Give us this day [^g]our daily bread. 







###### 12 



And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. 







###### 13 



And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from [^h]evil.[^i]' 







###### 14 



For if you forgive _other_ people for their [^j]offenses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. 







###### 15 



But if you do not forgive _other_ people, then your Father will not forgive your [^k]offenses. ## Fasting; The True Treasure; Wealth 







###### 16 



"Now whenever you fast, do not make a gloomy face as the hypocrites _do_, for they [^l]distort their faces so that they will be noticed by people when they are fasting. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full. 







###### 17 



But as for you, when you fast, [^m]anoint your head and wash your face, 







###### 18 



so that your fasting will not be noticed by people but by your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees _what is done_ in secret will reward you. 







###### 19 



"Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. 







###### 20 



But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal; 







###### 21 



for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. 







###### 22 



"The eye is the lamp of the body; so then, if your eye is [^n]clear, your whole body will be full of light. 







###### 23 



But if your eye is [^o]bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. So if the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness! 







###### 24 



"No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and [^p]wealth. ## The Cure for Anxiety 







###### 25 



"For this reason I say to you, [^q]do not be worried about your [^r]life, _as to_ what you will eat or what you will drink; nor for your body, _as to_ what you will put on. Is life not more than food, and the body more than clothing? 







###### 26 



Look at the birds of the sky, that they do not sow, nor reap, nor gather _crops_ into barns, and _yet_ your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more important than they? 







###### 27 



And which of you by worrying can add a single [^s]day to his [^t]life's span? 







###### 28 



And why are you worried about clothing? Notice how the lilies of the field grow; they do not labor nor do they spin _thread for cloth_, 







###### 29 



yet I say to you that not even Solomon in all his glory clothed himself like one of these. 







###### 30 



But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which is _alive_ today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, _will He_ not much more _clothe_ you? You of little faith! 







###### 31 



Do not worry then, saying, 'What are we to eat?' or 'What are we to drink?' or 'What are we to wear for clothing?' 







###### 32 



For the Gentiles eagerly seek all these things; for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. 







###### 33 



But [^u]seek first [^v]His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be [^w]provided to you. 







###### 34 



"So do not worry about tomorrow; for tomorrow will [^x]worry about itself. [^y]Each day has enough trouble of its own. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

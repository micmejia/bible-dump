# Matthew 7

***








###### 1 



"Do not [^a]judge, so that you will not be judged. 







###### 2 



For in the way you judge, you will be judged; and [^b]by your standard of measure, it will be measured to you. 







###### 3 



Why do you look at the [^c]speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? 







###### 4 



Or how [^d]can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the [^e]speck out of your eye,' and look, the log is in your own eye? 







###### 5 



You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the [^f]speck out of your brother's eye! 







###### 6 



"Do not give what is holy to dogs, and do not throw your pearls before pigs, or they will trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces. ## Prayer and the Golden Rule 







###### 7 



"[^g]Ask, and it will be given to you; [^h]seek, and you will find; [^i]knock, and it will be opened to you. 







###### 8 



For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened. 







###### 9 



Or what person is there among you [^j]who, when his son asks for a loaf of bread, [^k]will give him a stone? 







###### 10 



Or [^l]if he asks for a fish, he will not give him a snake, will he? 







###### 11 



So if you, _despite_ being [^m]evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him! 







###### 12 



"In everything, therefore, [^n]treat people the same way you want [^o]them to treat you, for this is the Law and the Prophets. ## The Narrow and Wide Gates 







###### 13 



"Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it. 







###### 14 



For the gate is narrow and the way is constricted that leads to life, and there are few who find it. ## A Tree and Its Fruit 







###### 15 



"Beware of the false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves. 







###### 16 



You will [^p]know them by their fruits. [^q]Grapes are not gathered from thorn _bushes_, nor figs from thistles, are they? 







###### 17 



So every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit. 







###### 18 



A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. 







###### 19 



Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. 







###### 20 



So then, you will [^r]know them by their fruits. 







###### 21 



"Not everyone who says to Me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of My Father who is in heaven _will enter_. 







###### 22 



Many will say to Me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name perform many [^s]miracles?' 







###### 23 



And then I will declare to them, 'I never knew you; leave Me, you who practice lawlessness.' ## The Two Foundations 







###### 24 



"Therefore, everyone who hears these words of Mine, and [^t]acts on them, will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. 







###### 25 



And the rain fell and the [^u]floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and _yet_ it did not fall, for it had been founded on the rock. 







###### 26 



And everyone who hears these words of Mine, and does not [^v]act on them, will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. 







###### 27 



And the rain fell and the [^w]floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and it fell--and its collapse was great." 







###### 28 



[^x]When Jesus had finished these words, the crowds were amazed at His teaching; 







###### 29 



for He was teaching them as one who had authority, and not as their scribes. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

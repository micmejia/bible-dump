# Matthew 8

***








###### 1 



When [^a]Jesus came down from the mountain, [^b]large crowds followed Him. 







###### 2 



And a man with [^c]leprosy came to Him and [^d]bowed down before Him, and said, "Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean." 







###### 3 



[^e]Jesus reached out with His hand and touched him, saying, "I am willing; be cleansed." And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. 







###### 4 



And Jesus *said to him, "See that you tell no one; but go, show yourself to the priest and present the [^f]offering that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." ## The Centurion's Faith 







###### 5 



And when [^g]Jesus entered Capernaum, a [^h]centurion came to Him, begging Him, 







###### 6 



and saying, "[^i]Lord, my [^j]servant is lying paralyzed at home, terribly tormented." 







###### 7 



Jesus *said to him, "I will come and heal him." 







###### 8 



But the centurion replied, "[^k]Lord, I am not worthy for You to come under my roof, but just [^l]say the word, and my [^m]servant will be healed. 







###### 9 



For I also am a man under authority, with soldiers under me; and I say to this one, 'Go!' and he goes, and to another, 'Come!' and he comes, and to my slave, 'Do this!' and he does _it_." 







###### 10 



Now when Jesus heard _this_, He was amazed and said to those who were following, "Truly I say to you, I have not found such great faith [^n]with anyone in Israel. 







###### 11 



And I say to you that many will come from east and west, and [^o]recline _at the table_ with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven; 







###### 12 



but the sons of the kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth." 







###### 13 



And Jesus said to the centurion, "Go; [^p]it shall be done for you as you have believed." And the [^q]servant was healed at that _very_ [^r]moment. ## Peter's Mother-in-law and Many Others Healed 







###### 14 



When Jesus came into Peter's [^s]home, He saw his mother-in-law lying sick in bed with a fever. 







###### 15 



And He touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she got up and [^t]waited on Him. 







###### 16 



Now when evening came, they brought to Him many who were demon-possessed; and He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were ill. 







###### 17 



_This happened_ so that what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet would be fulfilled: "He Himself took our illnesses and [^u]carried away our diseases." ## Discipleship Tested 







###### 18 



Now when Jesus saw a crowd around Him, He gave orders to depart to the other side _of the sea_. 







###### 19 



Then a scribe came and said to Him, "Teacher, I will follow You wherever You go." 







###### 20 



And Jesus *said to him, "The foxes have holes and the birds of the sky _have_ nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head." 







###### 21 



And another of the disciples said to Him, "Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father." 







###### 22 



But Jesus *said to him, "Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead." ## Jesus Calms the Storm 







###### 23 



When He got into the boat, His disciples followed Him. 







###### 24 



And behold, a [^v]violent storm developed on the sea, so that the boat was being covered by the waves; but _Jesus_ Himself was asleep. 







###### 25 



And they came to _Him_ and woke Him, saying, "Save _us_, Lord; we are perishing!" 







###### 26 



He *said to them, "Why are you [^w]afraid, you men of little faith?" Then He got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and [^x]it became perfectly calm. 







###### 27 



The men were amazed, and said, "What kind of a man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?" ## Jesus Sends Demons into Pigs 







###### 28 



And when He came to the other side into the country of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men confronted Him as they were coming out of the tombs. _They were_ so extremely violent that no one could pass by that way. 







###### 29 



And they cried out, saying, "[^y]What business do You have with us, Son of God? Have You come here to torment us before [^z]the time?" 







###### 30 



Now there was a herd of many pigs feeding at a distance from them. 







###### 31 



And the demons begged Him, saying, "If You _are going to_ cast us out, send us into the herd of pigs." 







###### 32 



And He said to them, "Go!" And they came out and went into the pigs; and behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and [^aa]drowned in the waters. 







###### 33 



And the herdsmen ran away, and went to the city and reported everything, [^ab]including what had happened to the demon-possessed men. 







###### 34 



And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw Him, they pleaded with Him to leave their region. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

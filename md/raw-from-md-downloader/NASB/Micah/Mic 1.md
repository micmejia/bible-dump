# Micah 1

***








###### 1 



The word of the LORD which came to Micah of Moresheth in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, _and_ Hezekiah, kings of Judah, _and_ which he saw regarding Samaria and Jerusalem. 







###### 2 



Hear, you peoples, all of [^a]you; Listen carefully, earth and [^b]all it contains, And may the Lord [^c]God be a witness against you, The Lord from His holy temple. 







###### 3 



For behold, the LORD is coming forth from His place. He will come down and tread on the high places of the [^d]earth. 







###### 4 



The mountains will melt under Him And the valleys will be split, Like wax before the fire, Like water poured down a steep place. 







###### 5 



All this is due to the [^e]wrongdoing of Jacob And the sins of the house of Israel. What is the [^f]wrongdoing of Jacob? Is it not Samaria? What is the high [^g]place of Judah? Is it not Jerusalem? 







###### 6 



For I will make Samaria a heap of ruins [^h]in the open country, Planting places for a vineyard. I will hurl her stones down into the valley, And lay bare her foundations. 







###### 7 



All of her idols will be crushed, All of her earnings will be burned with fire, And all of her images I will make desolate; For she collected _them_ from a prostitute's earnings, And to the earnings of a prostitute they will return. 







###### 8 



Because of this I must mourn and wail, I must go barefoot and naked; I must do mourning like the jackals, And a mourning like the ostriches. 







###### 9 



For her wound is incurable, For it has come to Judah; It has reached the gate of my people, _Even_ to Jerusalem. 







###### 10 



Do not tell _it_ in Gath, Do not weep at all. At [^i]Beth-le-aphrah roll yourself in the dust in mourning. 







###### 11 



[^j]Go on your way, inhabitant of [^k]Shaphir, in shameful nakedness. The inhabitant of [^l]Zaanan does not [^m]escape. The mourning of [^n]Beth-ezel: "He will take from you its [^o]support." 







###### 12 



For the inhabitant of [^p]Maroth [^q]Waits for _something_ good, Because a disaster has come down from the LORD To the gate of Jerusalem. 







###### 13 



Harness the chariot to the team of horses, You inhabitant of Lachish-- She was the beginning of sin To the daughter of Zion-- Because in you were found The rebellious acts of Israel. 







###### 14 



Therefore you will give parting gifts In behalf of Moresheth-gath; The houses of Achzib _will_ become a [^r]deception To the kings of Israel. 







###### 15 



Moreover, I will bring on you The one who takes possession, You inhabitant of [^s]Mareshah. The glory of Israel will enter Adullam. 







###### 16 



Shave yourself bald, yes, cut off your hair, Because of the children of your delight; Extend your baldness like the eagle, For they will go from you into exile. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

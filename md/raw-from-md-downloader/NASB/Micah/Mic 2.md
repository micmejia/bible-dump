# Micah 2

***








###### 1 



Woe to those who devise wrongdoing, Who practice evil on their beds! [^a]When morning comes, they do it, Because it is in the power of their hands. 







###### 2 



They covet fields, so they seize _them_; And houses, so they take _them_. They [^b]exploit a man and his house, A person and his inheritance. 







###### 3 



Therefore this is what the LORD says: "Behold, I am planning against this family a catastrophe From which you cannot remove your necks; And you will not walk haughtily, For it will be an evil time. 







###### 4 



On that day they will take up against you a [^c]song of mocking And [^d]utter a song of mourning _and_ say, 'We are completely destroyed! He exchanges the share of my people; How He removes it from me! To the apostate He apportions our fields.' 







###### 5 



Therefore you will have no one [^e]applying a measuring line For you by lot in the assembly of the LORD. 







###### 6 



'Do not prophesy,' _so_ they prophesy. _But if_ [^f]they do not prophesy about these things, Insults will not be turned back. 







###### 7 



Is it being said, house of Jacob: 'Is the Spirit of the LORD impatient? Are these His works?' Do My words not do good For the one walking rightly? 







###### 8 



[^g]Recently My people have arisen as an enemy-- You strip the robe off the garment From unsuspecting passers-by, _From_ those returned from war. 







###### 9 



You evict the women of My people, _Each one_ from her pleasant house. From her children you take My splendor forever. 







###### 10 



Arise and go, For this is no place of rest Because of the uncleanness that brings on destruction, A painful destruction. 







###### 11 



If someone walking _after_ wind and falsehood Had lied _and said_, 'I will prophesy to you about wine and liquor,' He would become a prophet to this people. 







###### 12 



"I will certainly assemble all of you, Jacob, I will certainly gather the remnant of Israel. I will put them together like sheep in the fold; Like a flock in the midst of its pasture They will be noisy with people. 







###### 13 



The one who breaks through goes up before them; They break through, pass through the gate, and go out by it. So their king passes on before them, And the LORD at their head." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

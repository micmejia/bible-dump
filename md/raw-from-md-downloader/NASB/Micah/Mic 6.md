# Micah 6

***








###### 1 



Hear now what the LORD is saying, "Arise, plead your case [^a]before the mountains, And let the hills hear your voice. 







###### 2 



Listen, you mountains, to the indictment by the LORD, And you enduring foundations of the earth, Because the LORD has a case against His people; And He will dispute with Israel. 







###### 3 



My people, what have I done to you, And how have I wearied you? Answer Me. 







###### 4 



Indeed, I brought you up from the land of Egypt, I redeemed you from the house of slavery, And I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. 







###### 5 



My people, remember now What Balak king of Moab planned And what Balaam son of Beor answered him, _And what happened_ from Shittim to Gilgal, [^b]So that you might know the righteous acts of the LORD." ## What God Requires of Mankind 







###### 6 



With what shall I come to the LORD _And_ bow myself before the God on high? Shall I come to Him with burnt offerings, With yearling calves? 







###### 7 



Does the LORD take pleasure in thousands of rams, In ten thousand rivers of [^c]oil? Shall I give _Him_ my firstborn _for_ my wrongdoings, The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? 







###### 8 



He has told you, mortal one, what is good; And what does the LORD require of you But to do justice, to love [^d]kindness, And to walk [^e]humbly with your God? 







###### 9 



The voice of the LORD will call to the city-- And it is sound wisdom to fear Your name: "[^f]Hear, you tribe. Who has designated [^g]its time? 







###### 10 



Is there still a person _in_ the wicked house, _Along with_ treasures of wickedness, And a [^h]short measure _that is_ cursed? 







###### 11 



Can I justify dishonest balances, And a bag of fraudulent weights? 







###### 12 



For the rich people of [^i]the city are full of violence, Her residents speak lies, And their tongue is deceitful in their mouth. 







###### 13 



So also I will make _you_ sick, striking you down, Making _you_ desolate because of your sins. 







###### 14 



You will eat, but you will not be satisfied, And your filth _will be_ in your midst. You will _try to_ remove _valuables for safekeeping_, But you will not save _it all_, And what you do save I will turn over to the sword. 







###### 15 



You will sow but you will not harvest. You will tread the olive _press_ but will not anoint yourself with oil; And _tread out_ sweet wine, but you will not drink _any_ wine. 







###### 16 



The statutes of Omri And every work of the house of Ahab are maintained, And you walk by their plans. Therefore I will give you up for destruction, And [^j]your inhabitants for [^k]derision, And you will suffer the taunting of My people." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Micah 7

***








###### 1 



Woe to me! For I am Like harvests of summer fruit, like gleanings of grapes. There is not a cluster of grapes _left_ to eat, _Nor_ an early fig, _which_ [^a]I crave. 







###### 2 



The [^b]godly person has perished from the land, And there is no upright _person_ among mankind. All of them lie in wait for bloodshed; Each of them hunts the other _with_ a net. 







###### 3 



As for evil, both hands do it well. The leader asks for a bribe, also the judge, And the great one speaks the capricious desire of his soul; So they plot it together. 







###### 4 



The best of them is like a thorn bush, The most upright like a thorn hedge. The day [^c]when you post your watchmen, Your punishment is coming. Then their confusion will occur. 







###### 5 



Do not trust in a neighbor; Do not have confidence in a close friend. Guard [^d]your lips From her who lies [^e]in your arms. 







###### 6 



For son disavows father, Daughter rises up against her mother, Daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; A person's enemies are the people of his own household. ## God Is the Source of Salvation and Light 







###### 7 



But as for me, I will be on the watch for the LORD; I will wait for the God of my salvation. My God will hear me. 







###### 8 



Do not rejoice over me, enemy of mine. Though I fall I will rise; Though I live in darkness, the LORD is a light for me. 







###### 9 



I will endure the rage of the LORD Because I have sinned against Him, Until He pleads my case and executes justice for me. He will bring me out to the light, _And_ I will look at His [^f]righteousness. 







###### 10 



Then my enemy will see, And shame will cover her who said to me, "Where is the LORD your God?" My eyes will look at her; [^g]At that time she will [^h]be trampled down Like mud of the streets. 







###### 11 



_It will be_ a day for building your walls. On that day _your_ boundary will be extended. 







###### 12 



It _will be_ a day when [^i]they will come to you From Assyria and the cities of Egypt, From Egypt even to the _Euphrates_ River, Even from sea to sea and mountain to mountain. 







###### 13 



And the earth will become a wasteland because of her inhabitants, On account of the fruit of their deeds. 







###### 14 



Shepherd Your people with Your scepter, The flock of Your [^j]possession Which lives by itself _in_ the woodland, In the midst of [^k]a fruitful field. Let them feed _in_ Bashan and Gilead As in the days of old. 







###### 15 



"As in the days when you went out from the land of Egypt, I will show [^l]you miracles." 







###### 16 



Nations will see and be ashamed Of all their might. They will put _their_ hand on _their_ mouth, Their ears will be deaf. 







###### 17 



They will lick up dust like a snake, Like [^m]reptiles of the earth. They will come trembling out of their [^n]fortresses; To the LORD our God they will come in trepidation, And they will be afraid of You. 







###### 18 



Who is a God like You, who pardons wrongdoing And passes over a rebellious act of the remnant of His [^o]possession? He does not retain His anger forever, Because He delights in mercy. 







###### 19 



He will again take pity on us; He will trample on our wrongdoings. Yes, You will cast all [^p]their sins Into the depths of the sea. 







###### 20 



You will give [^q]truth to Jacob _And_ favor to Abraham, Which You swore to our forefathers From the days of old. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

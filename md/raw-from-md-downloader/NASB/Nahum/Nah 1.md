# Nahum 1

***








###### 1 



The pronouncement of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite: 







###### 2 



A jealous and avenging God is the LORD; The LORD is avenging and [^a]wrathful. The LORD takes vengeance on His adversaries, And He reserves wrath for His enemies. 







###### 3 



The LORD is slow to anger and great in power, And the LORD will by no means leave _the guilty_ unpunished. In _the_ gale and _the_ storm is His way, And clouds are the dust _beneath_ His feet. 







###### 4 



He rebukes the sea and dries it up; He dries up all the rivers. Bashan and Carmel wither, The blossoms of Lebanon wither. 







###### 5 



Mountains quake because of Him, And the hills come apart; Indeed the earth is upheaved by His presence, The world and all the inhabitants in it. 







###### 6 



Who can stand before His indignation? Who can endure the burning of His anger? His wrath gushes forth like fire, And the rocks are broken up by Him. 







###### 7 



The LORD is good, A stronghold in the day of trouble, And He knows those who take refuge in Him. 







###### 8 



But with an overflowing flood He will make a complete end of [^b]its site, And will pursue His enemies _into_ darkness. 







###### 9 



Whatever you devise against the LORD, He will make a complete end of it. Distress will not rise up twice. 







###### 10 



Like tangled thorns, And like those who are drunken with their drink, They are consumed Like stubble completely dried up. 







###### 11 



From you has gone out One who plotted evil against the LORD, A [^c]wicked counselor. 







###### 12 



This is what the LORD says: "Though _they are at_ full _strength_ and so _they are_ many, So also they will be cut off and pass away. Though I have afflicted you, I will afflict you no longer. 







###### 13 



So now, I will break his yoke from upon you, And I will tear your shackles to pieces." 







###### 14 



The LORD has issued a command concerning [^d]you: "[^e]Your name will no longer be perpetuated. I will eliminate the carved image and the cast metal image From the house of your gods. I will prepare your grave, For you are contemptible." 







###### 15 



[^f]Behold, on the mountains, the feet of him who brings good news, Who announces peace! Celebrate your feasts, Judah, Pay your vows. For never again will the [^g]wicked one pass through you; He is eliminated completely. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

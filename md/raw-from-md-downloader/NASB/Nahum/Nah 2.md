# Nahum 2

***








###### 1 



[^a]The one who scatters has come up against [^b]you. Keep watch over the fortress, watch the road; [^c]Bind up your waist, [^d]summon all your strength. 







###### 2 



For the LORD will restore the splendor of Jacob Like the splendor of Israel, Even though destroyers have laid waste to them And ruined their vines. 







###### 3 



The shields of [^e]his warriors are dyed red, The warriors are dressed in scarlet, The chariots are _fitted_ with [^f]flashing steel [^g]When he is prepared _to march_, And the juniper spears are brandished. 







###### 4 



The chariots drive wildly in the streets, They rush around in the [^h]public squares; Their appearance is like torches, They drive back and forth like lightning flashes. 







###### 5 



He remembers his officers; They stumble in their advance, They hurry to her wall, And the [^i]mantelet is set up. 







###### 6 



The gates of the rivers are opened And the palace sways back and forth. 







###### 7 



It is set: She is stripped, she is led away, And her slave women are sobbing like the sound of doves, Beating their [^j]breasts. 







###### 8 



Though Nineveh _was_ like a pool of water throughout her days, Yet they are fleeing; "Stop, stop," But no one turns back. 







###### 9 



Plunder the silver, Plunder the gold! For there is no end to the treasure-- Wealth from every _kind of_ desirable object. 







###### 10 



She is emptied! Yes, she is desolate and waste! Hearts are melting and knees wobbling! Also trembling is in [^k]the entire body, And all their faces have become pale! 







###### 11 



Where is the den of the lions And the feeding place of the young lions, Where the lion, lioness, _and_ lion's cub went With nothing to disturb _them_? 







###### 12 



The lion tore enough for his cubs, [^l]Killed _enough prey_ for his lionesses, And filled his lairs with prey And his dens with torn flesh. 







###### 13 



"Behold, I am against you," declares the LORD of armies. "I will burn up her chariots in smoke, and a sword will devour your young lions; I will eliminate your prey from the land, and no longer will the voice of your messengers be heard." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

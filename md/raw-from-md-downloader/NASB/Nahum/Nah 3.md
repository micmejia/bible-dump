# Nahum 3

***








###### 1 



Woe to the bloody city, completely full of lies _and_ pillage; _Her_ prey does not leave. 







###### 2 



The sound of the whip, The sound of the roar of the wheel, Galloping horses And [^a]bounding chariots! 







###### 3 



Horsemen charging, Swords flashing, spears gleaming, Many killed, a mass of corpses, And there is no end to _the_ dead bodies-- They stumble over [^b]the dead bodies! 







###### 4 



_All_ because of the many sexual acts of the prostitute, The charming one, the mistress of sorceries, Who sells nations by her sexual acts, And families by her sorceries. 







###### 5 



"Behold, I am against you," declares the LORD of armies; "And I will [^c]lift up your skirts over your face, And show the nations your nakedness, And the kingdoms your shame. 







###### 6 



I will throw filth on you And declare you worthless, And set you up as a spectacle. 







###### 7 



And it will come about that all who see you Will [^d]shrink from you and say, 'Nineveh is devastated! Who will have sympathy for her?' Where shall I seek comforters for you?" 







###### 8 



Are you better than [^e]No-amon, Which was situated by the canals of the Nile, With water surrounding her, Whose rampart _was_ [^f]the sea, Whose wall _consisted_ of [^g]the sea? 







###### 9 



Ethiopia was _her_ might, Egypt too, without limits. Put and Lubim were among [^h]her helpers. 







###### 10 



Yet she became an exile, She went into captivity; Also her small children were smashed to pieces At the head of every street; They cast lots for her honorable men, And all her great men were bound with shackles. 







###### 11 



You too will become drunk, You will be hidden. You too will search for a refuge from the enemy. 







###### 12 



All your fortifications are fig trees with [^i]ripe fruit-- When shaken, they fall into the eater's mouth. 







###### 13 



Behold, your people are women in your midst! The gates of your land are opened wide to your enemies; Fire consumes your gate bars. 







###### 14 



Draw for yourself water for a siege! Strengthen your fortifications! Go into the clay and tread the mortar! Take hold of the brick mold! 







###### 15 



There fire will consume you, The sword will cut you down; It will consume you as the creeping locust _consumes a crop_. Multiply yourself like the creeping locust, Multiply yourself like the migratory locust. 







###### 16 



You have made your traders more numerous than the stars of heaven-- The creeping locust sheds its skin and flies _away_. 







###### 17 



Your courtiers are like the migratory locust. Your officials are like a swarm of locusts Settling in the stone shelters on a cold day. The sun rises and they flee, And the place where they are is not known. 







###### 18 



Your shepherds are sleeping, O king of Assyria; Your officers are lying down. Your people are scattered on the mountains And there is no one to gather _them_. 







###### 19 



There is no relief for your collapse, Your wound is incurable. All who hear [^j]about you Will clap _their_ hands over you, For upon whom has your evil not come continually? ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

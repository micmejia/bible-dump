###### 28 



Now the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, the temple servants, and all those who had separated themselves from the peoples of the lands to the Law of God, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, all those who had knowledge and understanding, 







###### 29 



are joining with their kinsmen, their nobles, and are [^c]taking on themselves a curse and an oath to walk in God's Law, which was given through Moses, God's servant, and to keep and to [^d]comply with all the commandments of [^e]God our Lord, and His ordinances and statutes; 







###### 30 



and that we will not give our daughters to the peoples of the land or take their daughters for our sons. 







###### 31 



As for the peoples of the land who bring wares or any grain on the Sabbath day to sell, we will not [^f]buy from them on the Sabbath or on _any_ holy day; and we will forgo _the crops of_ the seventh year and [^g]every debt. 







###### 32 



We also imposed [^h]on ourselves the obligation to contribute yearly a third of a shekel for the service of the house of our God: 







###### 33 



for the showbread, for the continual grain offering, for the continual burnt offering, the Sabbaths, the new moons, for the appointed times, for the holy things, and for the sin offerings to make atonement for Israel, and all the work of the house of our God. 







###### 34 



Likewise we cast lots for the supply of wood _among_ the priests, the Levites, and the people so that they could bring it to the house of our God, according to our fathers' households, at set times annually, to burn on the altar of the LORD our God, as it is written in the Law; 







###### 35 



and so that they could bring the first fruits of our ground and the first fruits of all the fruit of every tree to the house of the LORD annually, 







###### 36 



and bring to the house of our God the firstborn of our sons and of our cattle, and the firstborn of our herds and our flocks as it is written in the Law, for the priests who are ministering in the house of our God. 







###### 37 



We will also bring the first of our [^i]dough, our contributions, the fruit of every tree, the new wine, and the oil to the priests at the chambers of the house of our God, and the tithe of our ground to the Levites, for the Levites are they who receive the tithes in all the rural towns. 







###### 38 



And the priest, the son of Aaron, shall be with the Levites when the Levites receive tithes, and the Levites shall bring up the tenth of the tithes to the house of our God, to the chambers of the storehouse. 







###### 39 



For the sons of Israel and the sons of Levi shall bring the contribution of the grain, the new wine, and the oil to the chambers; the utensils of the sanctuary, the priests who are ministering, the gatekeepers, and the singers are there. So we will not [^j]neglect the house of our God. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

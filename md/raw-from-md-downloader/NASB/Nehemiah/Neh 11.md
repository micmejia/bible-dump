# Nehemiah 11

***








###### 1 



Now the leaders of the people lived in Jerusalem, but the rest of the people cast lots to bring one out of ten to live in Jerusalem, the holy city, while nine-tenths _remained_ in the _other_ cities. 







###### 2 



And the people blessed all the men who volunteered to live in Jerusalem. 







###### 3 



Now these are the heads of the provinces who lived in Jerusalem, but in the cities of Judah each lived on his own property in their cities--the [^a]Israelites, the priests, the Levites, the [^b]temple servants, and the [^c]descendants of Solomon's servants. 







###### 4 



Some of the sons of Judah and some of the sons of Benjamin lived in Jerusalem. From the sons of Judah: Athaiah the son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah, the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalalel, of the sons of Perez; 







###### 5 



and Maaseiah the son of Baruch, the son of Col-hozeh, the son of Hazaiah, the son of Adaiah, the son of Joiarib, the son of Zechariah, the son of the Shilonite.

Joel the son of Zichri was their overseer, and Judah the son of Hassenuah was second [^d]in command of the city.

Seraiah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the overseer of the house of God,

###### 15 



Now from the Levites: Shemaiah the son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Bunni; 







###### 16 



and Shabbethai and Jozabad, from the [^g]leaders of the Levites, who were [^h]in charge of the outside work of the house of God; 







###### 17 



and Mattaniah the son of Mica, the son of [^i]Zabdi, the son of Asaph, who was the [^j]leader in beginning the thanksgiving at prayer, and Bakbukiah, the second among his kinsmen; and [^k]Abda the son of [^l]Shammua, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun. 







###### 18 



All the Levites in the holy city _were_ 284. 







###### 19 



Also the gatekeepers: Akkub, Talmon, and their kinsmen who kept watch at the gates, _were_ 172. ## Outside Jerusalem 







###### 20 



The rest of Israel, of the priests _and_ of the Levites, _were_ in all the cities of Judah, each on his own inheritance. 







###### 21 



But the temple servants were living in Ophel, and Ziha and Gishpa were [^m]in charge of the temple servants. 







###### 22 



Now the overseer of the Levites in Jerusalem was Uzzi the son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Mica, from the sons of Asaph, _who were_ the singers for the [^n]service of the house of God. 







###### 23 



For _there was_ a commandment from the king concerning them and a royal command for the singers day by day. 







###### 24 



And Pethahiah the son of Meshezabel, of the sons of Zerah the son of Judah, was the king's [^o]representative for every matter concerning the people. 







###### 25 



Now as for the villages with their fields, some of the sons of Judah lived in Kiriath-arba and its [^p]towns, in Dibon and its [^q]towns, and in Jekabzeel and its villages,

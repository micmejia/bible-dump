# Nehemiah 2

***








###### 1 



And it came about in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, that wine _was_ before him, and I picked up the wine and gave it to the king. Now I had not been sad in his presence. 







###### 2 



So the king said to me, "Why is your face sad, though you are not ill? This is nothing but sadness of heart." Then I was very much afraid. 







###### 3 



And I said to the king, "May the king live forever. Why should my face not be sad when the city, the [^a]site of my fathers' tombs, is desolate and its gates have been consumed by fire?" 







###### 4 



Then the king said to me, "[^b]What would you request?" So I prayed to the God of heaven. 







###### 5 



Then I said to the king, "If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor before you, _I request_ that you send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers' tombs, that I may rebuild it." 







###### 6 



Then the king said to me, with the queen sitting beside him, "How long will your journey be, and when will you return?" So it pleased the king to send me, and I gave him a definite time. 







###### 7 



And I said to the king, "If it pleases the king, let letters be given me for the governors _of the provinces_ beyond the River, so that they will allow me to pass through until I come to Judah, 







###### 8 



and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, so that he will give me timber to make beams for the gates of the citadel which is by the [^c]temple, for the wall of the city, and for the house to which I will go." And the king granted _them_ to me because the good hand of my God _was_ on me. 







###### 9 



Then I came to the governors _of the provinces_ beyond the _Euphrates_ River and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent with me officers of the army and horsemen. 







###### 10 



And when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite [^d]official heard _about it_, it was very displeasing to them that someone had come to seek the welfare of the sons of Israel. ## Nehemiah Inspects Jerusalem's Walls 







###### 11 



So I came to Jerusalem and was there for three days. 







###### 12 



And I got up in the night, I and a few men with me. I did not tell anyone what my God was putting into my [^e]mind to do for Jerusalem, and there was no animal with me except the animal on which I was riding. 







###### 13 



So I went out at night by the Valley Gate in the direction of the Dragon's Spring and _on_ to the Dung Gate, and I was inspecting the walls of Jerusalem which were broken down and its gates which had been consumed by fire. 







###### 14 



Then I passed on to the Fountain Gate and the King's Pool, but there was no place for [^f]my mount to pass. 







###### 15 



So I was going up at night by the ravine and inspecting the wall. Then I entered the Valley Gate again and returned. 







###### 16 



However, the officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing; nor had I as yet told the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the officials, or the rest who were doing the work. 







###### 17 



Then I said to them, "You see the bad situation we are in, that Jerusalem is desolate and its gates have been burned by fire. Come, let's rebuild the wall of Jerusalem so that we will no longer be a disgrace." 







###### 18 



And I told them how the hand of my God had been favorable to me and also about the king's words which he had spoken to me. Then they said, "Let's arise and build." So they put their hands to the good _work_. 







###### 19 



But when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite [^g]official, and Geshem the Arab heard _about it_, they mocked us and despised us, and said, "What is this thing that you are doing? Are you rebelling against the king?" 







###### 20 



So I answered them and said to them, "The God of heaven will make us successful; therefore we His servants will arise and build, but you have no part, right, or memorial in Jerusalem." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Nehemiah 7

***








###### 1 



Now when the wall was rebuilt and I had installed the doors, and the gatekeepers, the singers, and the Levites were appointed, 







###### 2 



then I put Hanani my brother, and Hananiah the commander of the citadel, in charge of Jerusalem, for he was a faithful man and feared God more than many. 







###### 3 



Then I said to them, "The gates of Jerusalem are not to be opened until the sun is hot, and while they are standing _guard, the gatekeepers_ are to [^a]keep the doors shut and bolted. Also appoint guards from the inhabitants of Jerusalem, each at his post, and each in front of his own house." 







###### 4 



Now the city was large and spacious, but the people in it were few and the houses were not built. 







###### 5 



Then my God put it into my heart to assemble the nobles, the officials, and the _other_ people to be enrolled by genealogies. Then I found the book of the genealogy of those who came up first, [^b]in which I found the following record:

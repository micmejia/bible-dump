# Numbers 15

***








###### 1 



Now the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 







###### 2 



"Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, 'When you enter the land [^a]where you are going to live, which I am giving you, 







###### 3 



and you make an offering by fire to the LORD, a burnt offering or a sacrifice to [^b]fulfill a special vow, or as a [^c]voluntary offering or at your appointed times, to make a soothing aroma to the LORD from the herd or from the flock, 







###### 4 



then the one who presents his offering shall present to the LORD a grain offering of a tenth _of an_ [^d]_ephah_ of fine flour mixed with a fourth of a [^e]hin of oil, 







###### 5 



and you shall prepare wine for the drink offering, a fourth of a hin, with the burnt offering or for the sacrifice, for each lamb. 







###### 6 



Or for a ram you shall prepare as a grain offering two-tenths _of an ephah_ of fine flour mixed with a third of a hin of oil; 







###### 7 



and for the drink offering you shall offer a third of a hin of wine as a soothing aroma to the LORD. 







###### 8 



And when you prepare a bull as a burnt offering or a sacrifice, to [^f]fulfill a special vow, or for peace offerings to the LORD, 







###### 9 



then you shall offer with the bull a grain offering of three-tenths _of an ephah_ of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil; 







###### 10 



and you shall offer as the drink offering half a hin of wine as an offering by fire, as a soothing aroma to the LORD. 







###### 11 



'This is how it shall be done for each ox, or for each ram, or for each of the male lambs, or of the goats. 







###### 12 



According to the number that you prepare, so you shall do for each one according to their number. 







###### 13 



Everyone who is a native shall do these things in this way, in presenting an offering by fire as a soothing aroma to the LORD. ## Law for the Stranger 







###### 14 



Now if a stranger resides among you, or one who _may be_ among you throughout your generations, and he _wants to_ make an offering by fire, as a soothing aroma to the LORD, just as you do so shall he do. 







###### 15 



_As for_ the assembly, there shall be one statute for you and for the stranger who resides _among you_, a permanent statute throughout your generations; as you are, so shall the stranger be before the LORD. 







###### 16 



There is to be one law and one ordinance for you and for the stranger who resides with you.'" 







###### 17 



Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 







###### 18 



"Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, 'When you enter the land where I am bringing you, 







###### 19 



then it shall be, that when you eat from the [^g]food of the land, you shall lift up an [^h]offering to the LORD. 







###### 20 



Of the first of your [^i]dough you shall lift up a loaf as an [^j]offering; as an [^k]offering of the threshing floor, so you shall lift it up. 







###### 21 



From the first of your [^l]dough you shall give to the LORD an [^m]offering throughout your generations. 







###### 22 



'But when you unintentionally do wrong and fail to [^n]comply with all these commandments which the LORD has spoken to Moses, 







###### 23 



_that is_, all that the LORD has commanded you [^o]through Moses from the day that the LORD gave commandments and onward, throughout your generations, 







###### 24 



then it shall be, if it is done unintentionally, [^p]without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one bull as a burnt offering, as a soothing aroma to the LORD, with its grain offering and its drink offering, according to the ordinance, and one male goat as a sin offering. 







###### 25 



Then the priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the sons of Israel, and they will be forgiven; for it was an unintentional wrong, and they have brought their offering, an offering by fire to the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their unintentional wrong. 







###### 26 



So all the congregation of the sons of Israel will be forgiven, as well as the stranger who resides among them, for _guilt was attributed_ to all the people through an unintentional wrong. 







###### 27 



'Also, if one person sins unintentionally, then he shall offer a one-year-old female goat as a sin offering. 







###### 28 



And the priest shall make atonement before the LORD for the person who goes astray by an unintentional sin, making atonement for him [^q]so that he may be forgiven. 







###### 29 



You shall have one law for the native among the sons of Israel and for the stranger who resides among them, for one who does _anything wrong_ unintentionally. 







###### 30 



But the person who does _wrong_ [^r]defiantly, whether he is a native or a stranger, that one is blaspheming the LORD; and that person shall be cut off from among his people. 







###### 31 



Since he has despised the word of the LORD and has broken His commandment, that person shall be completely cut off; his [^s]guilt _will be_ on him.'" ## Sabbath-breaking Punished 







###### 32 



Now while the sons of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering wood on the Sabbath day. 







###### 33 



And those who found him gathering wood brought him to Moses and Aaron, and to all the congregation; 







###### 34 



and they placed him in custody, because it had not been decided what should be done to him. 







###### 35 



Then the LORD said to Moses, "The man must be put to death; all the congregation shall stone him with stones outside the camp." 







###### 36 



So all the congregation brought him outside the camp and stoned him [^t]to death with stones, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. 







###### 37 



The LORD also spoke to Moses, saying, 







###### 38 



"Speak to the sons of Israel and tell them that they shall make for themselves tassels on the corners of their garments throughout their generations, and that they shall put on the tassel of each corner a [^u]violet thread. 







###### 39 



It shall be a tassel for you [^v]to look at and remember all the commandments of the LORD, so that you will do them and not [^w]follow your own heart and your own eyes, [^x]which led you to prostitute yourselves, 







###### 40 



so that you will remember and do all My commandments and be holy to your God. 







###### 41 



I am the LORD your God who brought you out from the land of Egypt to be your God; I am the LORD your God." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

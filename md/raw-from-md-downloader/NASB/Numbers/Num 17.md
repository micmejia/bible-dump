# Numbers 17

***








###### 1 



[^a]Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 







###### 2 



"Speak to the sons of Israel, and obtain from them a staff for each father's household: twelve staffs, from all their leaders for their fathers' households. You shall write each man's name on his staff, 







###### 3 



and write Aaron's name on the staff of Levi; for _there is to be_ one staff for the head _of each_ of their fathers' households. 







###### 4 



You shall then leave them in the tent of meeting in front of the testimony, where I meet with you. 







###### 5 



And it will come about that the staff of the man whom I choose will sprout. So I will relieve Myself of the grumblings of the sons of Israel, who are grumbling against you." 







###### 6 



So Moses spoke to the sons of Israel, and all their leaders gave him a staff, one for each leader, for their fathers' households, twelve staffs _in all_, with the staff of Aaron among their staffs. 







###### 7 



Then Moses left the staffs before the LORD in the tent of the testimony. 







###### 8 



Now on the next day Moses went into the tent of the testimony; and behold, Aaron's staff for the house of Levi had sprouted and produced buds and bloomed with blossoms, and it yielded ripe almonds. 







###### 9 



Moses then brought out all the staffs from the presence of the LORD to all the sons of Israel; and they looked, and each man took his staff. 







###### 10 



But the LORD said to Moses, "Put the staff of Aaron back in front of the testimony [^b]to be kept as a sign against the [^c]rebels, so that you may put an end to their grumblings against Me and they do not die." 







###### 11 



Moses did _so_; just as the LORD had commanded him, so he did. 







###### 12 



Then the sons of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, "Behold, we are passing away, we are perishing, we are all perishing! 







###### 13 



Everyone who comes near, who comes near to the tabernacle of the LORD, must die. Are we to perish completely?" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

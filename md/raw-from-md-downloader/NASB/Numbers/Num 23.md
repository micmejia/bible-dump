# Numbers 23

***








###### 1 



Then Balaam said to Balak, "Build seven altars for me here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me here." 







###### 2 



Balak did just as Balaam had spoken, and Balak and Balaam offered up a bull and a ram on _each_ altar. 







###### 3 



Then Balaam said to Balak, "Stand beside your burnt offering, and I will go; perhaps the LORD will come to meet me, and whatever He shows me I will tell you." So he went to a bare hill. 







###### 4 



Now God met with Balaam, and he said to Him, "I have set up the seven altars, and I have offered up a bull and a ram on _each_ altar." 







###### 5 



Then the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth and said, "Return to Balak, and this is what you shall speak." 







###### 6 



So he returned to him, and behold, he was standing beside his burnt offering, he and all the leaders of Moab. 







###### 7 



And he took up his discourse and said, "From Aram Balak has brought me, Moab's king from the mountains of the East, _saying_, 'Come, declare Jacob cursed for me, And come, curse Israel!' 







###### 8 



How am I to put a curse on him upon whom God has not put a curse? And how am I to curse him whom the LORD has not cursed? 







###### 9 



For I see him from the top of the rocks, And I look at him from the hills; Behold, a people that lives in isolation, And does not consider itself _to be_ among the nations. 







###### 10 



Who has counted the dust of Jacob, Or the number of the fourth part of Israel? May [^a]I die the death of the upright, And may my end be like his!" 







###### 11 



Then Balak said to Balaam, "What have you done to me? I took you to put a curse on my enemies, but behold, you have actually blessed _them!"_ 







###### 12 



He replied, "Must I not be careful to speak what the LORD puts in my mouth?" 







###### 13 



Then Balak said to him, "Please come with me to another place from where you may see them, _although_ you will only see the extreme end of them and will not see all of them; and put a curse on them for me from there." 







###### 14 



So he took him to the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and he built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on _each_ altar. 







###### 15 



Then he said to Balak, "Stand here beside your burnt offering while I myself meet _the _Lord__ over there." 







###### 16 



Then the LORD met Balaam and put a word in his mouth, and said, "Return to Balak, and this is what you shall speak." 







###### 17 



So he came to him, and behold, he was standing beside his burnt offering, and the leaders of Moab with him. And Balak said to him, "What has the LORD spoken?" 







###### 18 



Then he took up his discourse and said, "Arise, Balak, and hear; Listen to me, son of Zippor! 







###### 19 



God is not a man, that He would lie, Nor a son of man, that He would change His mind; Has He said, and will He not do it? Or has He spoken, and will He not make it good? 







###### 20 



Behold, I have received _a command_ to bless; When He has blessed, I cannot revoke it. 







###### 21 



He has not looked at misfortune in Jacob; Nor has He seen trouble in Israel; The LORD his God is with him, And the joyful shout of a king is among them. 







###### 22 



God brings them out of Egypt, _He is_ for them like the horns of the wild ox. 







###### 23 



For there is no magic curse against Jacob, Nor is there any divination against Israel; At the _proper_ time it shall be said to Jacob And to Israel, what God has done! 







###### 24 



Behold, a people rises like a lioness, And like a lion it raises itself; It will not lie down until it devours the prey, And drinks the blood of those slain." 







###### 25 



Then Balak said to Balaam, "Do not curse them at all nor bless them at all!" 







###### 26 



But Balaam replied to Balak, "Did I not tell you, '[^b]Whatever the LORD speaks, I must do'?" 







###### 27 



Then Balak said to Balaam, "Please come, I will take you to another place; perhaps it will be [^c]agreeable with God that you curse them for me from there." 







###### 28 



So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, which overlooks the [^d]desert. 







###### 29 



And Balaam said to Balak, "Build seven altars for me here and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me here." 







###### 30 



Balak did just as Balaam had said, and offered up a bull and a ram on _each_ altar. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

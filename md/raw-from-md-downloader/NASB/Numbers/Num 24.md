# Numbers 24

***








###### 1 



When Balaam saw that it [^a]pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he did not go as at other times to [^b]seek omens, rather he turned his [^c]attention toward the wilderness. 







###### 2 



And Balaam raised his eyes and saw Israel [^d]camping tribe by tribe; and the Spirit of God came upon him. 







###### 3 



Then he took up his discourse and said, "The declaration of Balaam the son of Beor, And the declaration of the man whose eye is opened; 







###### 4 



The declaration of him who hears the [^e]words of God, Who sees the vision of [^f]the Almighty, Falling down, yet having his eyes uncovered, 







###### 5 



How pleasant are your tents, Jacob, Your dwelling places, Israel! 







###### 6 



Like [^g]valleys that stretch out, Like gardens beside a river, Like aloes planted by the LORD, Like cedars beside the waters. 







###### 7 



Water will flow from his buckets, And his seed _will be_ by many waters, And his king shall be higher than Agag, And his kingdom shall be exalted. 







###### 8 



God brings him out of Egypt, _He is_ for him like the horns of the wild ox. He will devour the nations _who are_ his adversaries, And will crush their bones, And smash _them_ with his arrows. 







###### 9 



He [^h]crouches, he lies down like a lion, And like a lioness, who [^i]dares to rouse him? Blessed is _everyone_ who blesses you, And cursed is _everyone_ who curses you." 







###### 10 



Then Balak's anger burned against Balaam, and he struck his [^j]hands together; and Balak said to Balaam, "I called you to curse my enemies, but behold, you have persisted in blessing them these three times! 







###### 11 



So [^k]flee to your place now. I said I would honor you greatly, but behold, the LORD has held you back from honor." 







###### 12 



And Balaam said to Balak, "Did I not in fact tell your messengers whom you had sent to me, saying, 







###### 13 



'If Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not do _anything_ contrary to the [^l]command of the LORD, either good or bad, of my own [^m]accord. What the LORD speaks, I will [^n]speak'? 







###### 14 



So now, behold, I am going to my people; come, _and_ I will advise you of what this people will do to your people in the [^o]days to come." 







###### 15 



Then he took up his discourse and said, "The declaration of Balaam the son of Beor, And the declaration of the man whose eye is opened, 







###### 16 



The declaration of him who hears the [^p]words of God, And knows the knowledge of the [^q]Most High, Who sees the vision of [^r]the Almighty, Falling down, yet having his eyes uncovered: 







###### 17 



I see him, but not now; I look at him, but not near; A star shall appear from Jacob, A scepter shall rise from Israel, And shall smash the [^s]forehead of Moab, And overcome all the sons of Sheth. 







###### 18 



And Edom shall be a possession, Seir, its enemies, also will be a possession, While Israel performs valiantly. 







###### 19 



One from Jacob shall rule, And will eliminate the survivors from the city." 







###### 20 



And he looked at Amalek and took up his discourse and said, "Amalek was the first of the nations, But his end _shall be_ [^t]destruction." 







###### 21 



And he looked at the Kenite, and took up his discourse and said, "Your dwelling place is enduring, And your nest is set in the cliff. 







###### 22 



Nevertheless Kain will suffer devastation; How long will Asshur [^u]keep you captive?" 







###### 23 



Then he took up his discourse and said, "Oh, who can live unless God has ordained it? 







###### 24 



But ships _shall come_ from the coast of Kittim, And they shall oppress Asshur and oppress Eber; So they also _will come_ to destruction." 







###### 25 



Then Balaam arose, and he departed and returned to his place, and Balak also went on his way. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

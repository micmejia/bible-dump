# Numbers 28

***








###### 1 



Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 







###### 2 



"Command the sons of Israel and say to them, 'You shall be careful to present to Me My offering, My food for My offerings by fire, of a soothing aroma to Me, at their appointed time.' 







###### 3 



And you shall say to them, 'This is the offering by fire which you shall offer to the LORD: two male lambs one year old without defect _as_ a continual burnt offering every day. 







###### 4 



You shall offer the one lamb in the morning, and the other lamb you shall offer [^a]at twilight; 







###### 5 



also a tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a grain offering, mixed with a fourth of a [^b]hin of pure oil. 







###### 6 



It is a continual burnt offering which was ordained on Mount Sinai as a soothing aroma, an offering by fire to the LORD. 







###### 7 



Then the drink offering with it _shall be_ a fourth of a hin for each lamb; in the Holy Place pour out a drink offering of strong drink to the LORD. 







###### 8 



The other lamb you shall offer [^c]at twilight; as the grain offering of the morning and as its drink offering, you shall offer it, an offering by fire, a soothing aroma to the LORD. 







###### 9 



'Then on the Sabbath day two male lambs one year old without defect, and two-tenths _of an_ [^d]_ephah_ of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, and its drink offering: 







###### 10 



_This is_ the burnt offering of every Sabbath in addition to the continual burnt offering and its drink offering. 







###### 11 



'Then at the beginning of _each of_ your months you shall present a burnt offering to the LORD: two [^e]bulls and one ram, seven male lambs one year old without defect; 







###### 12 



and three-tenths _of an ephah_ of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, for each bull; and two-tenths of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, for the one ram; 







###### 13 



and a tenth _of an ephah_ of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering for each lamb, as a burnt offering of a soothing aroma, an offering by fire to the LORD. 







###### 14 



Their drink offerings shall be half a hin of wine for a bull and a third of a hin for the ram and a fourth of a hin for a lamb; this is the burnt offering of each month throughout the months of the year. 







###### 15 



And one male goat as a sin offering to the LORD; it shall be offered with its drink offering in addition to the continual burnt offering. 







###### 16 



'The LORD's Passover _shall be_ on the fourteenth day of the first month. 







###### 17 



On the fifteenth day of this month _there shall be_ a feast; unleavened bread shall be eaten for seven days. 







###### 18 



On the first day _there shall be_ a holy assembly; you shall do no laborious work. 







###### 19 



But you shall present an offering by fire, a burnt offering to the LORD: two [^f]bulls and one ram, and seven male lambs one year old, _that_ you have without defect. 







###### 20 



For their grain offering, you shall offer fine flour mixed with oil: three-tenths _of an ephah_ for a bull, and two-tenths for the ram. 







###### 21 



A tenth _of an ephah_ you shall offer for [^g]each of the seven lambs; 







###### 22 



and one male goat as a sin offering to make atonement for you. 







###### 23 



You shall present these besides the burnt offering of the morning, which is for a continual burnt offering. 







###### 24 



In this way you shall present daily, for seven days, the food of the offering by fire, of a soothing aroma to the LORD; it shall be presented with its drink offering in addition to the continual burnt offering. 







###### 25 



On the seventh day you shall have a holy assembly; you shall do no laborious work. 







###### 26 



'Also on the day of the first fruits, when you present a new grain offering to the LORD in your _Feast of_ Weeks, you shall have a holy assembly; you shall do no laborious work. 







###### 27 



But you shall offer a burnt offering as a soothing aroma to the LORD: two bulls, one ram, _and_ seven male lambs one year old; 







###### 28 



and _as_ their grain offering, fine flour mixed with oil: three-tenths _of an ephah_ for each bull, two-tenths for the one ram, 







###### 29 



_and_ a tenth for [^h]each of the seven lambs; 







###### 30 



_also_ one male goat to make atonement for you. 







###### 31 



Besides the continual burnt offering and its grain offering, you shall present _them_ with their drink offerings. They shall be without [^i]defect. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Numbers 30

***








###### 1 



[^a]Then Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes of the sons of Israel, saying, "This is the word which the LORD has commanded: 







###### 2 



If a man makes a vow to the LORD, or takes an oath to [^b]put himself under a binding obligation, he shall not break his word; he shall act in accordance with everything that comes out of his mouth. 







###### 3 



"And if a woman makes a vow to the LORD, and puts herself under a binding obligation in her father's house in her youth, 







###### 4 



and her father hears her vow and her obligation under which she has put herself, and her father [^c]says nothing to her, then all her vows shall [^d]remain valid and every binding obligation under which she has put herself shall [^e]remain valid. 







###### 5 



But if her father expresses disapproval to her on the day he hears _of it_, none of her vows or her obligations under which she has put herself shall remain valid; and the LORD will [^f]forgive her because her father has expressed disapproval to her. 







###### 6 



"However, if she happens to [^g]marry while [^h]under her vows or the impulsive statement of her lips by which she has obligated herself, 







###### 7 



and her husband hears of it and says nothing to her on the day he hears _it_, then her vows shall remain valid and her binding obligations under which she has put herself shall remain valid. 







###### 8 



But if on the day her husband hears _of it_, he expresses disapproval to her, then he will annul her vow which [^i]she is under and the impulsive statement of her lips by which she has obligated herself; and the LORD will [^j]forgive her. 







###### 9 



"But _as for_ the vow of a widow or of a divorced woman, every binding obligation under which she has put herself, shall remain valid against her. 







###### 10 



However, if _a married woman_ vowed _in_ her husband's house, or put herself under a binding obligation with an oath, 







###### 11 



and her husband heard _it_, but said nothing to her _and_ did not express disapproval to her, then all her vows shall remain valid and every binding obligation under which she put herself shall remain valid. 







###### 12 



But if her husband actually annuls them on the day he hears _them_, then no utterance from her lips concerning her vows or the obligation _she put on_ herself shall remain valid; her husband has annulled them, and the LORD will [^k]forgive her. 







###### 13 



"Every vow and every binding oath to humble herself, her husband may confirm it or her husband may annul it. 







###### 14 



But if her husband in fact says nothing to her from day to day, then he confirms all her vows or all her binding obligations which are on her; he has confirmed them, because he said nothing to her on the day he heard them. 







###### 15 



However, if he actually annuls them [^l]after he has heard them, then he shall bear _the responsibility for_ her guilt." 







###### 16 



These are the statutes which the LORD commanded Moses _concerning matters_ between a man and his wife, _and_ between a father and his daughter _while she is_ in her youth _in_ her father's house. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

###### 50 



Then the LORD spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan _opposite_ Jericho, saying, 







###### 51 



"Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, 'When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan, 







###### 52 



you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from you, and destroy all their _idolatrous_ sculptures, destroy all their cast metal images, and eliminate all their high places; 







###### 53 



and you shall take possession of the land and live in it, for I have given the land to you to possess it. 







###### 54 



You shall maintain the land as an inheritance by lot according to your families; to the larger you shall give more inheritance, and to the smaller you shall give less inheritance. Wherever the lot falls to anyone, that shall be his. You shall pass on _land_ as an inheritance according to the tribes of your fathers. 







###### 55 



But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land from you, then it will come about that those whom you let remain of them _will be_ like thorns in your eyes and like pricks in your sides, and they will trouble you in the land in which you live. 







###### 56 



And just as I plan to do to them, I will do to you.'" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

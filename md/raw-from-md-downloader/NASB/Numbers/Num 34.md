# Numbers 34

***








###### 1 



Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 







###### 2 



"Command the sons of Israel and say to them, 'When you enter the land of Canaan, this is the land that shall fall to you as an inheritance, _that is, the_ land of Canaan according to its borders. 







###### 3 



Your southern region shall [^a]extend from the wilderness of Zin along the side of Edom, and your southern border shall [^b]extend from the end of the Salt Sea eastward. 







###### 4 



Then your border shall change direction from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim and [^c]continue to Zin, and its [^d]termination shall be to the south of Kadesh-barnea; and it shall [^e]reach Hazaraddar and [^f]continue to Azmon. 







###### 5 



Then the border shall change direction from Azmon to the brook of Egypt, and its termination shall be _at_ the sea. 







###### 6 



'As for the western border, you shall have the Great Sea, that is, _its_ [^g]coastline; this shall be your western border. 







###### 7 



'And this shall be your northern border: you shall draw your boundary from the Great Sea to Mount Hor. 







###### 8 



You shall draw a boundary from Mount Hor to the [^h]Lebo-hamath, and the termination of the border shall be at Zedad; 







###### 9 



and the border shall proceed to Ziphron, and its termination shall be at Hazar-enan. This shall be your northern border. 







###### 10 



'For your eastern border you shall also draw a boundary from Hazar-enan to Shepham, 







###### 11 



and the border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah on the east _side_ of Ain; and the border shall go down and reach to the slope on the east side of the Sea of Chinnereth. 







###### 12 



And the border shall go down to the Jordan, and its termination shall be at the Salt Sea. This shall be your land according to its borders on all sides.'" 







###### 13 



So Moses commanded the sons of Israel, saying, "This is the land that you are to possess by lot, which the LORD has commanded to give to the nine and a half tribes. 







###### 14 



For the tribe of the sons of Reuben have received _theirs_ according to their fathers' households, and the tribe of the sons of Gad according to their fathers' households, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their possession. 







###### 15 



The two and a half tribes have received their possession across the Jordan _opposite_ Jericho, eastward toward the sunrise." 







###### 16 



Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 







###### 17 



"These are the names of the men who shall assign the land to you as an inheritance: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun. 







###### 18 



And you shall take one leader of each tribe to assign the land as an inheritance. 







###### 19 



These are the names of the men: of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh. 







###### 20 



Of the tribe of the sons of Simeon, Samuel the son of Ammihud. 







###### 21 



Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon. 







###### 22 



And of the tribe of the sons of Dan, a leader, Bukki the son of Jogli. 







###### 23 



Of the sons of Joseph: of the tribe of the sons of Manasseh, a leader, Hanniel the son of Ephod. 







###### 24 



Of the tribe of the sons of Ephraim, a leader, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan. 







###### 25 



Of the tribe of the sons of Zebulun, a leader, Elizaphan the son of Parnach. 







###### 26 



Of the tribe of the sons of Issachar, a leader, Paltiel the son of Azzan. 







###### 27 



Of the tribe of the sons of Asher, a leader, Ahihud the son of Shelomi. 







###### 28 



Of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali, a leader, Pedahel the son of Ammihud." 







###### 29

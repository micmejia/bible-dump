# Numbers 6

***








###### 1 



Again the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 







###### 2 



"Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, 'When a man or woman makes [^a]a special vow, _namely_, the vow of a [^b]Nazirite, to live as a Nazirite for the LORD, 







###### 3 



he shall abstain from wine and [^c]strong drink; he shall [^d]consume no vinegar, _whether made_ from wine or strong drink, nor shall he drink any grape juice nor eat fresh or dried grapes. 







###### 4 



All the days of his consecration he shall not eat anything that is produced from the grape vine, from _the_ seeds even to _the_ skin. 







###### 5 



'All the days of his vow of consecration no razor shall pass over his head. He shall be holy until the days are fulfilled which he lives as a Nazirite for the LORD; he shall let the locks of hair on his head grow long. 







###### 6 



'All the days of his life as a Nazirite for the LORD he shall not come up to a dead person. 







###### 7 



He shall not make himself unclean for his father or for his mother, for his brother or for his sister, when they die, because his consecration to God is [^e]on his head. 







###### 8 



All the days of his consecration he is holy to the LORD. 







###### 9 



'But if _someone_ dies very suddenly beside him and he defiles his consecrated head _of hair_, then he shall shave his head on the day when he becomes clean; he shall shave it on the seventh day. 







###### 10 



Then on the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves or two young doves to the priest, to the entrance of the tent of meeting. 







###### 11 



And the priest shall offer one as a sin offering and _the_ other as a burnt offering, and make atonement for him [^f]regarding his sin because of the _dead_ person. And on that same day he shall consecrate his head, 







###### 12 



and shall live his days of consecration as a Nazirite for the LORD, and shall bring a male lamb a year old as a guilt offering; but the preceding days will [^g]not count, because his consecration was defiled. 







###### 13 



'Now this is the law of the Nazirite when the days of his consecration are fulfilled: he shall bring [^h]his offering to the entrance of the tent of meeting. 







###### 14 



And he shall present his offering to the LORD: one male lamb a year old without defect as a burnt offering, one ewe lamb a year old without defect as a sin offering, one ram without defect as a peace offering, 







###### 15 



and a basket of unleavened loaves of fine flour mixed with oil and unleavened wafers spread with oil, along with their grain offering and their drink offering. 







###### 16 



Then the priest shall present _them_ before the LORD and offer his sin offering and his burnt offering. 







###### 17 



He shall also offer the ram as a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD, together with the basket of unleavened bread; the priest shall also offer its grain offering and its drink offering. 







###### 18 



The Nazirite shall then shave his consecrated head _of hair_ at the entrance of the tent of meeting, and take the consecrated hair of his head and put _it_ on the fire which is under the sacrifice of peace offerings. 







###### 19 



And the priest shall take the ram's shoulder _when it has been_ boiled, and one unleavened loaf from the basket and one unleavened wafer, and shall put _them_ on the [^i]hands of the Nazirite after he has shaved his consecrated _hair_. 







###### 20 



Then the priest shall wave them as a wave offering before the LORD. It is holy for the priest, together with the breast _offered as_ a wave offering, and the thigh _offered as_ [^j]a contribution; and afterward the Nazirite may drink wine.' 







###### 21 



"This is the law of the Nazirite who vows his offering to the LORD according to his consecration, in addition to what _else_ [^k]he can afford; corresponding to his vow which he makes, so he shall do according to the law of his consecration." ## Aaron's Benediction 







###### 22 



Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 







###### 23 



"Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, 'In this way you shall bless the sons of Israel. You are to say to them: 







###### 24 



The LORD bless you, and [^l]keep you; 







###### 25 



The LORD cause His face to shine on you, And be gracious to you; 







###### 26 



The LORD lift up His face to you, And give you peace.' 







###### 27 



So they shall [^m]invoke My name on the sons of Israel, and _then_ I will bless them." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

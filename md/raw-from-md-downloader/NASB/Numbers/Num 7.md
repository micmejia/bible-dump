# Numbers 7

***








###### 1 



Now on the day that Moses had finished setting up the tabernacle, he anointed it and consecrated it with all its furnishings, and the altar and all its utensils; he anointed them and consecrated them also. 







###### 2 



Then the leaders of Israel, the heads of their fathers' households, made an offering (they were the leaders of the tribes; they were the [^a]supervisors over the [^b]numbered men). 







###### 3 



When they brought their offering before the LORD, six covered carts and twelve oxen, a cart for _every_ two of the leaders and an ox for each one, then they presented them in front of the tabernacle. 







###### 4 



Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 







###### 5 



"Accept _these things_ from them, that they may be [^c]used in the service of the tent of meeting, and you shall give them to the Levites, _to_ each man according to his service." 







###### 6 



So Moses took the carts and the oxen and gave them to the Levites. 







###### 7 



Two carts and four oxen he gave to the sons of Gershon, according to their service, 







###### 8 



and four carts and eight oxen he gave to the sons of Merari, according to their service, [^d]under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest. 







###### 9 



But he did not give _any_ to the sons of Kohath, because theirs _was_ the service of the holy _objects, which_ they carried on the shoulder. 







###### 10 



And the leaders offered the dedication _offering_ [^e]for the altar [^f]when it was anointed, so the leaders offered their offering before the altar. 







###### 11 



Then the LORD said to Moses, "They shall present their offering, one leader each day, for the dedication of the altar." 







###### 12

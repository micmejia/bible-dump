# Obadiah 1

***








###### 1 



The vision of Obadiah. This is what the Lord [^a]God says concerning Edom-- We have heard a report from the LORD, And a messenger has been sent among the nations _saying_, "Arise, and let's go up against her for battle"-- 







###### 2 



"Behold, I will make you small among the nations; You are greatly despised. 







###### 3 



The arrogance of your heart has deceived you, The one who lives in the clefts of [^b]the rock, _On the_ height of his dwelling place, Who says in his heart, 'Who will bring me down to earth?' 







###### 4 



Though you make _your home_ high like the eagle, Though you set your nest among the stars, From there I will bring you down," declares the LORD. 







###### 5 



"If thieves came to you, If [^c]robbers by night-- Oh how you will be ruined!-- Would they not steal _only_ [^d]until they had enough? If grape-pickers came to you, Would they not leave _some_ gleanings? 







###### 6 



Oh how Esau will be searched, _And_ his hidden treasures searched out! 







###### 7 



All the people [^e]allied with you Will send you to the border, _And_ the people at peace with you Will deceive you _and_ overpower you. _They who eat_ your bread Will set an ambush for you. (There is no understanding [^f]in him.) 







###### 8 



Will I not on that day," declares the LORD, "Eliminate wise men from Edom, And understanding from the mountain of Esau? 







###### 9 



Then your warriors will be filled with terror, Teman, So that everyone will be eliminated from the mountain of Esau by murder. 







###### 10 



"Because of violence to your brother Jacob, Shame will cover you, And you will be eliminated forever. 







###### 11 



On the day that you stood aloof, On the day that strangers carried off his wealth, And foreigners entered his gate And cast lots for Jerusalem-- You too were as one of them. 







###### 12 



Do not [^g]gloat over your brother's day, The day of his misfortune. And do not rejoice over the sons of Judah On the day of their destruction; Yes, do not [^h]boast On the day of _their_ distress. 







###### 13 



Do not enter the gate of My people On the day of their disaster. You indeed, do not [^i]gloat over their catastrophe On the day of their disaster. And do not lay _a hand_ on their wealth On the day of their disaster. 







###### 14 



Do not stand at the crossroads To eliminate their survivors; And do not hand over their refugees On the day of their distress. ## The Day of the LORD and the Future 







###### 15 



"For the day of the LORD is near for all the nations. Just as you have done, it will be done to you. Your dealings will return on your own head. 







###### 16 



For just as you drank on My holy mountain, All the nations will drink continually. They will drink [^j]to the last drop, And become as if they had never existed. 







###### 17 



But on Mount Zion there will be those who escape, And it will be holy. And the house of Jacob will [^k]possess their [^l]property. 







###### 18 



Then the house of Jacob will be a fire, And the house of Joseph a flame; But the house of Esau _will be_ like stubble. And they will set [^m]them on fire and consume [^n]them, So that there will be no survivor of the house of Esau," For the LORD has spoken. 







###### 19 



Then _those of_ the [^o]Negev will [^p]possess the mountain of Esau, And _those of_ the [^q]Shephelah the Philistine _plain_; Also, they will [^r]possess the territory of Ephraim and the territory of Samaria, And Benjamin _the territory of_ Gilead. 







###### 20 



And the exiles of this army of the sons of Israel, Who are _among_ the Canaanites as far as Zarephath, And the exiles of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad, Will [^s]possess the cities of the Negev. 







###### 21 



[^t]The deliverers will ascend Mount Zion To judge the mountain of Esau, And the kingdom will be the LORD's. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Philemon 1

***








###### 1 



Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy [^a]our brother, To Philemon our beloved _brother_ and fellow worker, 







###### 2 



and to Apphia [^b]our sister, and to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house: 







###### 3 



Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. ## Philemon's Love and Faith 







###### 4 



I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers, 







###### 5 



because I hear of your love and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the [^c]saints; 







###### 6 



_and I pray_ that the fellowship of your faith may become effective [^d]through the knowledge of every good thing which is in you [^e]for the sake of Christ. 







###### 7 



For I have had great joy and comfort in your love, because the [^f]hearts of the [^g]saints have been refreshed through you, brother. 







###### 8 



Therefore, though I have [^h]enough confidence in Christ to order you _to do_ what is proper, 







###### 9 



_yet_ for love's sake I rather appeal _to you_--since I am such a person as Paul, [^i]an old man, and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus-- ## Plea for Onesimus, a Free Man 







###### 10 



I appeal to you for my [^j]son [^k]Onesimus, whom I [^l]fathered in my [^m]imprisonment, 







###### 11 



who previously was useless to you, but now is useful both to you and to me. 







###### 12 



I have sent him back to you in person, that is, _sending_ my very heart, 







###### 13 



whom I wanted to keep with me, so that in your behalf he might be at my service in my [^n]imprisonment for the gospel; 







###### 14 



but I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that your goodness would not be, in effect, by compulsion, but of your own free will. 







###### 15 



For perhaps _it was_ for this reason _that_ he was separated _from you_ for a while, that you would have him back forever, 







###### 16 



no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord. 







###### 17 



If then you regard me _as_ a partner, accept him as _you would_ me. 







###### 18 



But if he has wronged you in any way or owes _you anything_, charge that to my account; 







###### 19 



I, Paul, have written _this_ with my own hand, I will repay _it_ (not to [^o]mention to you that you owe to me even your own self as well). 







###### 20 



Yes, brother, let me benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ. 







###### 21 



Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, since I know that you will do even more than what I say. 







###### 22 



At the same time also prepare me a guest room, for I hope that through your prayers I will be given to you. 







###### 23 



Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you, 







###### 24 



_as do_ Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, _and_ Luke, my fellow workers. 







###### 25 



The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.[^p] ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

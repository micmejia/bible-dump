# Philippians 1

***








###### 1 



Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus, To all the [^a]saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, [^b]including the overseers and deacons: 







###### 2 



Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 







###### 3 



I thank my God in all my remembrance of you, 







###### 4 



always offering prayer with joy in my every prayer for you all, 







###### 5 



in view of your [^c]participation in the gospel from the first day until now. 







###### 6 



_For I am_ confident of this very thing, that He who began a good work [^d]among you will complete it [^e]by the day of Christ Jesus. 







###### 7 



[^f]For it is only right for me to feel this way about you all, because I have you in my heart, since both in my [^g]imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are [^h]partakers of grace with me. 







###### 8 



For God is my witness, how I long for you all with the [^i]affection of Christ Jesus. 







###### 9 



And this I pray, that your love may overflow still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment, 







###### 10 



so that you may [^j]discover the things that are excellent, that you may be sincere and blameless for the day of Christ; 







###### 11 



having been filled with the fruit of righteousness which _comes_ through Jesus Christ, for the glory and praise of God. ## The Gospel Is Preached 







###### 12 



Now I want you to know, brothers _and sisters_, that my circumstances have turned out for the greater progress of the gospel, 







###### 13 



so that my [^k]imprisonment in _the cause of_ Christ has become well known throughout the [^l]praetorian guard and to everyone else, 







###### 14 



and that most of the brothers _and sisters_, [^m]trusting in the Lord because of my [^n]imprisonment, have far more courage to speak the word of God without fear. 







###### 15 



Some, to be sure, are preaching Christ even [^o]from envy and strife, but some also [^p]from goodwill; 







###### 16 



the latter _do it_ out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel; 







###### 17 



the former proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition [^q]rather than from pure motives, thinking that they are causing me distress in my [^r]imprisonment. 







###### 18 



What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in this I rejoice. But _not only that_, I also will rejoice, 







###### 19 



for I know that this will turn out for my [^s]deliverance through your [^t]prayers and the provision of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, 







###### 20 



according to my eager expectation and hope, that I will not be put to shame in anything, but _that_ with all boldness, Christ will even now, as always, be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death. ## To Live Is Christ 







###### 21 



For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain. 







###### 22 



[^u]But if _I am_ to live _on_ in the flesh, this _will mean_ fruitful labor for me; and I do not know [^v]which to choose. 







###### 23 



But I am hard-pressed from both _directions_, having the desire to depart and be with Christ, for _that_ is very much better; 







###### 24 



yet to remain on in the flesh is more necessary for your sakes. 







###### 25 



Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all for your progress and joy [^w]in the faith, 







###### 26 



so that your pride in Christ Jesus may be abundant because of me by my coming to you again. 







###### 27 



Only conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or remain absent, I will hear about you that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one [^x]mind striving together for the faith of the gospel; 







###### 28 



and in no way alarmed by _your_ opponents--which is a sign of destruction for them, but of salvation for you, and this _too_, from God. 







###### 29 



For to you it has been granted for Christ's sake, not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer on His behalf, 







###### 30 



experiencing the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear _to be_ in me. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Philippians 2

***








###### 1 



Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any [^a]affection and compassion, 







###### 2 



make my joy complete [^b]by being of the same mind, maintaining the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose. 







###### 3 



Do nothing [^c]from [^d]selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility consider one another as more important than yourselves; 







###### 4 



do not _merely_ look out for your own personal _interests_, but also for the _interests_ of others. 







###### 5 



Have this attitude [^e]in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus, 







###### 6 



who, as He _already_ existed in the form of God, did not consider equality with God something to be [^f]grasped, 







###### 7 



but [^g]emptied Himself _by_ taking the form of a bond-servant _and_ [^h]being born in the likeness of men. 







###### 8 



And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death: death [^i]on a cross. 







###### 9 



For this reason also God highly exalted Him, and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name, 







###### 10 



so that at the name of Jesus every knee will bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, 







###### 11 



and _that_ every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. 







###### 12 



So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; 







###### 13 



for it is God who is at work in you, both to [^j]desire and to work for _His_ good pleasure. 







###### 14 



Do all things without complaining or arguments; 







###### 15 



so that you will [^k]prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you [^l]appear as [^m]lights in the world, 







###### 16 



holding firmly the word of life, so that on the day of Christ I can take pride because I did not run in vain nor labor in vain. 







###### 17 



But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and share my joy with you all. 







###### 18 



You too, _I urge you_, rejoice in the same way and share your joy with me. ## Timothy and Epaphroditus 







###### 19 



But I hope, [^n]in the Lord Jesus, to send Timothy to you shortly, so that I also may be encouraged when I learn of your condition. 







###### 20 



For I have no one _else_ of kindred spirit who will genuinely be concerned for your welfare. 







###### 21 



For they all seek after their own _interests_, not those of Christ Jesus. 







###### 22 



But you know of his proven character, that he served with me in the furtherance of the gospel like a child _serving_ his father. 







###### 23 



Therefore I hope to send him immediately, as soon as I see how things _go_ with me; 







###### 24 



and I trust in the Lord that I myself will also be coming shortly. 







###### 25 



But I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, who is also your [^o]messenger and minister to my need, 







###### 26 



because he was longing [^p]for you all and was distressed because you had heard that he was sick. 







###### 27 



For indeed he was sick to the point of death, but God had mercy on him, and not only on him but also on me, so that I would not have sorrow upon sorrow. 







###### 28 



Therefore I have sent him all the more eagerly, so that when you see him again you may rejoice and I may be less concerned _about you_. 







###### 29 



Receive him then in the Lord with all joy, and hold people like him in high regard, 







###### 30 



because he came close to death [^q]for the work of Christ, risking his life to compensate [^r]for your absence in your service to me. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

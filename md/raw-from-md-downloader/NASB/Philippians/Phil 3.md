# Philippians 3

***








###### 1 



Finally, my brothers _and sisters_, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things _again_ is no trouble for me, and it is a safeguard for you. 







###### 2 



Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the [^a]false circumcision; 







###### 3 



for we are the _true_ [^b]circumcision, who worship in the Spirit of God and take pride in Christ Jesus, and put no confidence in the flesh, 







###### 4 



although I myself _could boast as_ having confidence even in the flesh. If anyone else thinks he is confident in the flesh, I _have_ more _reason_: 







###### 5 



circumcised the eighth day, of the nation of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as to the Law, a Pharisee; 







###### 6 



as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to the righteousness which is in the Law, found blameless. 







###### 7 



But whatever things were gain to me, these things I have counted as loss because of Christ. 







###### 8 



More than that, I count all things to be loss [^c]in view of the surpassing value of [^d]knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, [^e]for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them _mere_ rubbish, so that I may gain Christ, 







###### 9 



and may be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own derived from _the_ Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which _comes_ from God on the basis of faith, 







###### 10 



that I may know Him and the power of His resurrection and [^f]the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death; 







###### 11 



if somehow I may attain to the resurrection from the dead. 







###### 12 



Not that I have already [^g]grasped _it all_ or have already become perfect, but I press on if I may also take hold of that [^h]for which I was even taken hold of by Christ Jesus. 







###### 13 



Brothers _and sisters_, I do not regard myself as having taken hold of _it yet_; but one thing _I do_: forgetting what _lies_ behind and reaching forward to what _lies_ ahead, 







###### 14 



I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. 







###### 15 



Therefore, all who are [^i]mature, let's have this attitude; and if in anything you have a different attitude, God will reveal that to you as well; 







###### 16 



however, let's keep [^j]living by that same _standard_ to which we have attained. 







###### 17 



Brothers _and sisters_, join in following my example, and observe those who walk according to the pattern you have in us. 







###### 18 



For many walk, of whom I often told you, and now tell you even as I weep, _that they are_ the enemies of the cross of Christ, 







###### 19 



whose end is destruction, whose god is _their_ [^k]appetite, and _whose_ glory is in their shame, who have their minds on earthly things. 







###### 20 



For our [^l]citizenship is in heaven, from which we also eagerly wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ; 







###### 21 



who will transform the body of our lowly condition into conformity with [^m]His glorious body, by the exertion of the power that He has even to subject all things to Himself. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

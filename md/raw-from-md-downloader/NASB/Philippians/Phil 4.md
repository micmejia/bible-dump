# Philippians 4

***








###### 1 



Therefore, my beloved brothers _and sisters_, [^a]whom I long _to see_, my joy and crown, stand firm in the Lord in this way, my beloved. 







###### 2 



I urge Euodia and I urge Syntyche to [^b]live in harmony in the Lord. 







###### 3 



Indeed, true [^c]companion, I ask you also, help these women who have shared my struggle in _the cause of_ the gospel, together with Clement as well as the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life. 







###### 4 



Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice! 







###### 5 



Let your gentle _spirit_ be known to all people. The Lord is [^d]near. 







###### 6 



Do not [^e]be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and pleading with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. 







###### 7 



And the peace of God, which surpasses all [^f]comprehension, will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus. 







###### 8 



Finally, brothers _and sisters_, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is [^g]lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise, think about these things. 







###### 9 



As for the things you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, practice these things, and the God of peace will be with you. ## God's Provisions 







###### 10 



But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at last you have revived your concern for me; indeed, you were concerned _before_, but you lacked an opportunity _to act_. 







###### 11 



Not that I speak [^h]from need, for I have learned to be [^i]content in whatever _circumstances_ I am. 







###### 12 



I know how to get along with little, and I also know how to live in prosperity; in any and every _circumstance_ I have learned the secret of being filled and going hungry, both of having abundance and suffering need. 







###### 13 



I can do all things [^j]through Him who strengthens me. 







###### 14 



Nevertheless, you have done well to share _with me_ in my difficulty. 







###### 15 



You yourselves also know, Philippians, that at the [^k]first _preaching_ of the gospel, after I left Macedonia, no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving except you alone; 







###### 16 



for even in Thessalonica you sent _a gift_ more than once for my needs. 







###### 17 



Not that I seek the gift _itself_, but I seek the [^l]profit which increases to your account. 







###### 18 



But I have received everything in full and have an abundance; I am [^m]amply supplied, having received from Epaphroditus [^n]what you have sent, [^o]a fragrant aroma, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God. 







###### 19 



And my God will supply [^p]all your needs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus. 







###### 20 



Now to our God and Father _be_ the glory [^q]forever and ever. Amen. 







###### 21 



Greet every [^r]saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me greet you. 







###### 22 



All the [^s]saints greet you, especially those of Caesar's household. 







###### 23 



The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

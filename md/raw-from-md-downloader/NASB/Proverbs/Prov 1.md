# Proverbs 1

***








###### 1 



The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel: 







###### 2 



To know wisdom and instruction, To discern the sayings of understanding, 







###### 3 



To receive instruction in wise behavior, Righteousness, justice, and integrity; 







###### 4 



To give prudence to the naive, To the youth knowledge and discretion, 







###### 5 



A wise person will hear and increase in learning, And a person of understanding will acquire wise counsel, 







###### 6 



To understand a proverb and a saying, The words of the wise and their riddles. 







###### 7 



The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; Fools despise wisdom and instruction. ## The Enticement of Sinners 







###### 8 



Listen, my son, to your father's instruction, And do not ignore your mother's teaching; 







###### 9 



For they are a graceful wreath for your head And necklaces for your neck. 







###### 10 



My son, if sinners entice you, Do not consent. 







###### 11 



If they say, "Come with us, Let's lie in wait for blood, Let's ambush the innocent without cause; 







###### 12 



Let's swallow them alive like Sheol, Even whole, like those who go down to the pit; 







###### 13 



We will find all _kinds_ of precious wealth, We will fill our houses with plunder; 







###### 14 



Throw in your lot [^a]with us; We will all have one money bag," 







###### 15 



My son, do not walk on the way with them. Keep your feet from their path, 







###### 16 



For their feet run to evil, And they are quick to shed blood. 







###### 17 



Indeed, it is [^b]useless to spread the _baited_ net In the sight of any [^c]bird; 







###### 18 



But they lie in wait for their own blood; They ambush their own lives. 







###### 19 



Such are the ways of everyone who makes unjust gain; It takes away the life of its possessors. ## Wisdom Warns 







###### 20 



Wisdom shouts in the street, She [^d]raises her voice in the public square; 







###### 21 



At the head of the noisy _streets_ she cries out; At the entrance of the gates in the city she declares her sayings: 







###### 22 



"How long, you naive ones, will you love simplistic thinking? And _how long will_ scoffers delight themselves in scoffing And fools hate knowledge? 







###### 23 



Turn to my rebuke, Behold, I will pour out my spirit on you; I will make my words known to you. 







###### 24 



Because I called and you refused, I stretched out my hand and no one paid attention; 







###### 25 



And you neglected all my advice And did not want my rebuke; 







###### 26 



I will also laugh at your disaster; I will mock when your dread comes, 







###### 27 



When your dread comes like a storm And your disaster comes like a whirlwind, When distress and anguish come upon you. 







###### 28 



Then they will call on me, but I will not answer; They will seek me diligently but will not find me, 







###### 29 



Because they hated knowledge And did not choose the fear of the LORD. 







###### 30 



They did not accept my advice, They disdainfully rejected every rebuke from me. 







###### 31 



So they shall eat of the fruit of their own way, And be filled with their own schemes. 







###### 32 



For the faithlessness of the naive will kill them, And the complacency of fools will destroy them. 







###### 33 



But whoever listens to me will live securely And will be at ease from the dread of evil." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

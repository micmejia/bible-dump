# Proverbs 10

***








###### 1 



The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son makes a father glad, But a foolish son is a grief to his mother. 







###### 2 



[^a]Ill-gotten gains do not benefit, But righteousness rescues from death. 







###### 3 



The LORD will not allow the [^b]righteous to hunger, But He will [^c]reject the craving of the wicked. 







###### 4 



Poor is one who works with [^d]a lazy hand, But the hand of the diligent makes rich. 







###### 5 



He who gathers in summer is a son who acts wisely, _But_ he who sleeps in harvest is a son who acts shamefully. 







###### 6 



Blessings are on the head of the righteous, But the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 







###### 7 



The mentioning of the righteous is a blessing, But the name of the wicked will rot. 







###### 8 



The wise of heart will receive commands, But [^e]a babbling fool will come to ruin. 







###### 9 



One who walks in integrity walks securely, But one who perverts his ways will be found out. 







###### 10 



He who winks the eye causes trouble, And [^f]a babbling fool will come to ruin. 







###### 11 



The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life, But the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 







###### 12 



Hatred stirs up strife, But love covers all offenses. 







###### 13 



On the lips of the discerning, wisdom is found, But a rod is for the back of him who has no [^g]sense. 







###### 14 



Wise people store up knowledge, But with the mouth of the foolish, ruin is at hand. 







###### 15 



The rich person's wealth is his [^h]fortress, The ruin of the poor is their poverty. 







###### 16 



The [^i]wages of the righteous is life, The income of the wicked, punishment. 







###### 17 



One who is _on_ the path of life follows instruction, But one who ignores a rebuke goes astray. 







###### 18 



One who conceals hatred _has_ lying lips, And one who spreads slander is a fool. 







###### 19 



When there are many words, wrongdoing is unavoidable, But one who restrains his lips is wise. 







###### 20 



The tongue of the righteous is _like_ choice silver, The heart of the wicked is _worth_ little. 







###### 21 



The lips of the righteous feed many, But fools die for lack of [^j]understanding. 







###### 22 



It is the blessing of the LORD that makes rich, And He adds no sorrow to it. 







###### 23 



Doing wickedness is like sport to a fool, And _so is_ wisdom to a person of understanding. 







###### 24 



What the wicked fears will come upon him, But the desire of the righteous will be granted. 







###### 25 



When the whirlwind passes, the wicked is no more, But the righteous _has_ an everlasting foundation. 







###### 26 



Like vinegar to the teeth and smoke to the eyes, So is the [^k]lazy one to those who send him. 







###### 27 



The fear of the LORD prolongs [^l]life, But the years of the wicked will be shortened. 







###### 28 



The hope of the righteous is gladness, But the expectation of the wicked perishes. 







###### 29 



The way of the LORD is a stronghold for the upright, But ruin to the workers of injustice. 







###### 30 



The righteous will never be shaken, But the wicked will not live in the land. 







###### 31 



The mouth of the righteous flows with wisdom, But the perverted tongue will be cut out. 







###### 32 



The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable, But the mouth of the wicked, what is perverted. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

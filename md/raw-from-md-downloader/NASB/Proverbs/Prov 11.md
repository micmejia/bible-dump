# Proverbs 11

***








###### 1 



A false balance is an abomination to the LORD, But a just weight is His delight. 







###### 2 



When pride comes, then comes dishonor; But with the humble there is wisdom. 







###### 3 



The integrity of the upright will guide them, But the perversity of the treacherous will destroy them. 







###### 4 



Riches do not benefit on the day of wrath, But righteousness rescues from death. 







###### 5 



The righteousness of the blameless will smooth his way, But the wicked will fall by his own wickedness. 







###### 6 



The righteousness of the upright will rescue them, But the treacherous will be caught by _their own_ greed. 







###### 7 



When a wicked person dies, _his_ expectation will perish, And the hope of strong people perishes. 







###### 8 



The righteous is rescued from trouble, But the wicked [^a]takes his place. 







###### 9 



With _his_ mouth the godless person destroys his neighbor, But through knowledge the righteous will be rescued. 







###### 10 



When things go well for the righteous, the city rejoices, And when the wicked perish, there is joyful shouting. 







###### 11 



By the blessing of the upright a city is exalted, But by the mouth of the wicked, it is torn down. 







###### 12 



One who despises his neighbor lacks [^b]sense, But a person of understanding keeps silent. 







###### 13 



One who goes about as a slanderer reveals secrets, But one who is [^c]trustworthy conceals a matter. 







###### 14 



Where there is no guidance the people fall, But in an abundance of counselors there is [^d]victory. 







###### 15 



One who is a guarantor for a stranger will certainly suffer for it, But one who hates [^e]being a guarantor is secure. 







###### 16 



A gracious woman attains honor, And ruthless men attain riches. 







###### 17 



A merciful person does [^f]himself _good_, But the cruel person [^g]does himself harm. 







###### 18 



A wicked person earns deceptive wages, But one who sows righteousness _gets_ a true reward. 







###### 19 



One who is steadfast in righteousness _attains_ life, But one who pursues evil _attains_ his own death. 







###### 20 



The perverse in heart are an abomination to the LORD, But the blameless in _their_ [^h]walk are His delight. 







###### 21 



[^i]Be assured, the evil person will not go unpunished, But the [^j]descendants of the righteous will be rescued. 







###### 22 



_As_ a ring of gold in a pig's snout _So is_ a beautiful woman who lacks discretion. 







###### 23 



The desire of the righteous is only good, _But_ the expectation of the wicked is wrath. 







###### 24 



There is one who scatters, and _yet_ increases all the more, And there is one who withholds what is justly due, _and yet it results_ only in poverty. 







###### 25 



A [^k]generous person will be [^l]prosperous, And one who gives _others_ plenty of water will himself be given plenty. 







###### 26 



One who withholds grain, the people will curse him, But blessing will be on the head of him who sells _it_. 







###### 27 



One who diligently seeks good seeks favor, But one who seeks evil, evil will come to him. 







###### 28 



One who trusts in his riches will fall, But the righteous will flourish like the _green_ leaf. 







###### 29 



One who troubles his own house will inherit wind, And the foolish will be servant to the wise-hearted. 







###### 30 



The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, And one who is wise [^m]gains souls. 







###### 31 



If the righteous will be repaid on the earth, How much more the wicked and the sinner! ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

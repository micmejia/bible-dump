# Proverbs 12

***








###### 1 



One who loves [^a]discipline loves knowledge, But one who hates rebuke is stupid. 







###### 2 



A good person will obtain favor from the LORD, But He will condemn a person [^b]who devises evil. 







###### 3 



A person will not be established by wickedness, But the root of the righteous will not be moved. 







###### 4 



An [^c]excellent wife is the crown of her husband, But she who shames _him_ is like rottenness in his bones. 







###### 5 



The thoughts of the righteous are just, _But_ the counsels of the wicked are deceitful. 







###### 6 



The words of the wicked wait in ambush for blood, But the mouth of the upright will rescue them. 







###### 7 



The wicked are overthrown and are no more, But the house of the righteous will stand. 







###### 8 



A person will be praised according to his insight, But one of perverse [^d]mind will be despised. 







###### 9 



Better is one who is lightly esteemed and has a servant, Than one who honors himself and lacks bread. 







###### 10 



A righteous person has regard for the life of his animal, But _even_ the compassion of the wicked is cruel. 







###### 11 



One who works his land will have plenty of bread, But one who pursues worthless _things_ lacks [^e]sense. 







###### 12 



The wicked person desires the [^f]plunder of evil people, But the root of the righteous yields _fruit_. 







###### 13 



[^g]An evil person is ensnared by the offense of his lips, But the righteous will escape from trouble. 







###### 14 



A person will be satisfied with good by the fruit of his [^h]words, And the deeds of a person's hands will return to him. 







###### 15 



The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, But a person who listens to advice is wise. 







###### 16 



A fool's anger is known at once, But a prudent person conceals dishonor. 







###### 17 



One _who_ declares truth tells what is right, But a false witness, deceit. 







###### 18 



There is one who speaks rashly like the thrusts of a sword, But the tongue of the wise brings healing. 







###### 19 



Truthful lips will endure forever, But a lying tongue is only for a moment. 







###### 20 



Deceit is in the heart of those who devise evil, But counselors of peace _have_ joy. 







###### 21 



No harm happens to the righteous, But the wicked are filled with trouble. 







###### 22 



Lying lips are an abomination to the LORD, But those who deal faithfully are His delight. 







###### 23 



A prudent person conceals knowledge, But the heart of fools proclaims foolishness. 







###### 24 



The hand of the diligent will rule, But the [^i]lazy _hand_ will be put to forced labor. 







###### 25 



Anxiety in a person's heart weighs it down, But a good word makes it glad. 







###### 26 



The righteous person is a guide to his neighbor, But the way of the wicked leads them astray. 







###### 27 



[^j]A lazy person does not [^k]roast his prey, But the precious possession of a person _is_ diligence. 







###### 28 



In the way of righteousness there is life, And in _its_ pathway there is no death. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

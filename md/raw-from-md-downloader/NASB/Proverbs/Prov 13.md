# Proverbs 13

***








###### 1 



A wise son _accepts his_ father's discipline, But a scoffer does not listen to rebuke. 







###### 2 



From the fruit of a person's mouth he [^a]enjoys good, But the [^b]desire of the treacherous is violence. 







###### 3 



One who guards his mouth protects his life; One who opens wide his lips [^c]comes to ruin. 







###### 4 



The soul of the [^d]lazy one craves and _gets_ nothing, But the soul of the diligent is made [^e]prosperous. 







###### 5 



A righteous person hates a false statement, But a wicked person [^f]acts disgustingly and shamefully. 







###### 6 



Righteousness guards the [^g]one whose way is blameless, But wickedness brings the [^h]sinner to ruin. 







###### 7 



There is one who pretends to be rich but has nothing; _Another_ pretends to be poor, but has great wealth. 







###### 8 



The ransom of a person's life is his wealth, But the poor hears no rebuke. 







###### 9 



The light of the righteous [^i]rejoices, But the lamp of the wicked goes out. 







###### 10 



Through overconfidence [^j]comes nothing but strife, But wisdom is with those who receive counsel. 







###### 11 



Wealth _obtained_ from [^k]nothing dwindles, But one who gathers [^l]by labor increases _it_. 







###### 12 



Hope deferred makes the heart sick, But desire [^m]fulfilled is a tree of life. 







###### 13 



One who despises the word will do badly, But one who fears the commandment will be rewarded. 







###### 14 



The [^n]teaching of the wise is a fountain of life, To turn aside from the snares of death. 







###### 15 



Good understanding produces favor, But the way of the treacherous is [^o]their own disaster. 







###### 16 



Every prudent person acts with knowledge, But a fool [^p]displays foolishness. 







###### 17 



A wicked messenger falls into adversity, But a faithful messenger _brings_ healing. 







###### 18 



Poverty and shame _will come_ to one who neglects [^q]discipline, But one who complies with rebuke will be honored. 







###### 19 



Desire realized is sweet to the soul, But it is an abomination to fools to turn away from evil. 







###### 20 



One who walks with wise people will be wise, But a companion of fools will suffer harm. 







###### 21 



Adversity pursues sinners, But the righteous will be rewarded with prosperity. 







###### 22 



A good person leaves an inheritance to his [^r]grandchildren, And the wealth of a sinner is stored up for the righteous. 







###### 23 



Abundant food _is in_ the uncultivated ground of the poor, But [^s]it is swept away by injustice. 







###### 24 



He who withholds his [^t]rod hates his son, But he who loves him [^u]disciplines him diligently. 







###### 25 



The righteous [^v]has enough to satisfy his appetite, But the stomach of the wicked is in need. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Proverbs 14

***








###### 1 



The wise woman builds her house, But the foolish tears it down with her own hands. 







###### 2 



One who walks in his uprightness fears the LORD, But one who is devious in his ways despises Him. 







###### 3 



In the mouth of the foolish is a rod for _his_ back, But the lips of the wise will protect them. 







###### 4 



Where there are no oxen, the manger is clean; But much revenue _comes_ by the strength of the ox. 







###### 5 



A trustworthy witness will not lie, But a false witness declares lies. 







###### 6 



A scoffer seeks wisdom and _finds_ none, But knowledge is easy for one who has understanding. 







###### 7 



Leave the presence of a fool, Or you will not [^a]discern [^b]words of knowledge. 







###### 8 



The wisdom of the sensible is to understand his way, But the foolishness of fools is deceit. 







###### 9 



Fools mock at [^c]sin, But among the upright there is [^d]goodwill. 







###### 10 



The heart knows its own bitterness, And a stranger does not share its joy. 







###### 11 



The house of the wicked will be destroyed, But the tent of the upright will flourish. 







###### 12 



There is a way _which seems_ right to a person, But its end is the way of death. 







###### 13 



Even in laughter the heart may be in pain, And the end of joy may be grief. 







###### 14 



One with a wayward heart will have his fill of his own ways, But a good person will _be satisfied_ [^e]with his. 







###### 15 



The naive believes everything, But the sensible person considers his steps. 







###### 16 



A wise person [^f]is cautious and turns away from evil, But a fool is arrogant and careless. 







###### 17 



A quick-tempered person acts foolishly, And a person of evil devices is hated. 







###### 18 



The naive inherit foolishness, But the sensible are crowned with knowledge. 







###### 19 



The evil will bow down before the good, And the wicked at the gates of the righteous. 







###### 20 



The poor is hated even by his neighbor, But those who love the rich are many. 







###### 21 



One who despises his neighbor sins, But one who is gracious to the [^g]poor is blessed. 







###### 22 



Will they who devise evil not go astray? But kindness and truth _will be to_ those who devise good. 







###### 23 



In all labor there is profit, But [^h]mere talk _leads_ only to poverty. 







###### 24 



The crown of the wise is their riches, _But_ the foolishness of fools is _simply_ foolishness. 







###### 25 



A truthful witness saves lives, But one _who_ declares lies _is_ [^i]deceitful. 







###### 26 



In [^j]the fear of the LORD there is strong confidence, And [^k]his children will have refuge. 







###### 27 



[^l]The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life, _By which_ one may avoid the snares of death. 







###### 28 



In a multitude of people is a king's glory, But in the scarcity of people is a prince's ruin. 







###### 29 



One who is slow to anger has great understanding; But one who is [^m]quick-tempered exalts foolishness. 







###### 30 



A tranquil heart is life to the body, But jealousy is rottenness to the bones. 







###### 31 



One who oppresses the poor taunts his Maker, But one who is gracious to the needy honors Him. 







###### 32 



The wicked is thrust down by his own wrongdoing, But the righteous has a refuge when he dies. 







###### 33 



Wisdom rests in the heart of one who has understanding, But among fools it is made known. 







###### 34 



Righteousness exalts a nation, But sin is a disgrace to _any_ people. 







###### 35 



The king's favor is toward a servant who acts wisely, But his anger is toward him who acts shamefully. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

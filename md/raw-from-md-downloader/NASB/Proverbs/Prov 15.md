# Proverbs 15

***








###### 1 



A gentle answer turns away wrath, But a [^a]harsh word stirs up anger. 







###### 2 



The tongue of the wise makes knowledge pleasant, But the mouth of fools spouts foolishness. 







###### 3 



The eyes of the LORD are in every place, Watching the evil and the good. 







###### 4 



A [^b]soothing tongue is a tree of life, But perversion in it [^c]crushes the spirit. 







###### 5 



A fool [^d]rejects his father's discipline, But he who complies with rebuke is sensible. 







###### 6 



Great wealth is _in_ the house of the righteous, But trouble is in the income of the wicked. 







###### 7 



The lips of the wise spread knowledge, But the hearts of fools are not so. 







###### 8 



The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD, But the prayer of the upright is His delight. 







###### 9 



The way of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD, But He loves the one who pursues righteousness. 







###### 10 



There is severe punishment for one who abandons the way; One who hates a rebuke will die. 







###### 11 



[^e]Sheol and [^f]Abaddon _lie open_ before the LORD, How much more the hearts of [^g]mankind! 







###### 12 



A scoffer does not love one who rebukes him; He will not go to the wise. 







###### 13 



A joyful heart makes a [^h]cheerful face, But [^i]when the heart is sad, the spirit is broken. 







###### 14 



The mind of the intelligent seeks knowledge, But the mouth of fools feeds on foolishness. 







###### 15 



All the days of the [^j]needy are bad, But a [^k]cheerful heart _has_ a continual feast. 







###### 16 



Better is a little with [^l]the fear of the LORD Than great treasure, and turmoil with [^m]the treasure. 







###### 17 



Better is a portion of [^n]vegetables where there is love, Than a fattened ox _served_ with hatred. 







###### 18 



A hot-tempered person stirs up strife, But the slow to anger calms a dispute. 







###### 19 



The way of the [^o]lazy one is like a hedge of thorns, But the path of the upright is a highway. 







###### 20 



A wise son makes a father glad, But a foolish man despises his mother. 







###### 21 



Foolishness is joy to one who lacks [^p]sense, But a person of understanding walks straight. 







###### 22 



Without consultation, plans are frustrated, But with many counselors they [^q]succeed. 







###### 23 



A person has joy in an [^r]apt answer, And how delightful is a timely word! 







###### 24 



The path of life _leads_ upward for the wise, So that he may keep away from [^s]Sheol below. 







###### 25 



The LORD will tear down the house of the proud, But He will set the boundary of the widow. 







###### 26 



Evil plans are an abomination to the LORD, But pleasant words are pure. 







###### 27 



He who profits illicitly troubles his own house, But he who hates bribes will live. 







###### 28 



The heart of the righteous ponders how to answer, But the mouth of the wicked pours out evil things. 







###### 29 



The LORD is far from the wicked, But He hears the prayer of the righteous. 







###### 30 



[^t]Bright eyes gladden the heart; Good news [^u]refreshes the bones. 







###### 31 



_One whose_ ear listens to a life-giving rebuke Will stay among the wise. 







###### 32 



One who neglects discipline rejects himself, But one who listens to a rebuke acquires [^v]understanding. 







###### 33 



[^w]The fear of the LORD is the instruction for wisdom, And before honor _comes_ humility. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

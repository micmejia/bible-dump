# Proverbs 16

***








###### 1 



The plans of the heart belong to a person, But the answer of the tongue is from the LORD. 







###### 2 



All the ways of a person are clean in his own sight, But the LORD examines the [^a]motives. 







###### 3 



[^b]Commit your works to the LORD, And your plans will be established. 







###### 4 



The LORD has made everything for [^c]its own purpose, Even the wicked for the day of evil. 







###### 5 



Everyone who is proud in heart is an abomination to the LORD; [^d]Be assured, he will not go unpunished. 







###### 6 



By mercy and truth atonement is made for wrongdoing, And by [^e]the fear of the LORD one keeps away from evil. 







###### 7 



When a person's ways are pleasing to the LORD, He causes even his enemies to make peace with him. 







###### 8 



Better is a little with righteousness Than great income with injustice. 







###### 9 



The mind of a person plans his way, But the LORD directs his steps. 







###### 10 



A divine verdict is on the lips of the king; His mouth should not [^f]err in judgment. 







###### 11 



A just balance and scales belong to the LORD; All the [^g]weights of the bag are His [^h]concern. 







###### 12 



It is an abomination for kings to commit wicked acts, Because a throne is established on righteousness. 







###### 13 



Righteous lips are the delight of kings, And one who speaks right is loved. 







###### 14 



The fury of a king is _like_ messengers of death; But a wise person will appease it. 







###### 15 



In the light of a king's face is life, And his favor is like a cloud _with_ the [^i]spring rain. 







###### 16 



How much better it is to get wisdom than gold! And to get understanding is to be chosen above silver. 







###### 17 



The highway of the upright is to turn away from evil; One who watches his way protects his [^j]life. 







###### 18 



Pride _goes_ before destruction, And a haughty spirit before stumbling. 







###### 19 



It is better to be humble in spirit with the needy Than to divide the spoils with the proud. 







###### 20 



One who pays attention to the word will find good, And blessed is one who trusts in the LORD. 







###### 21 



The wise in heart will be called understanding, And sweetness of [^k]speech increases [^l]persuasiveness. 







###### 22 



Understanding is a fountain of life to those who have it, But the discipline of fools is foolishness. 







###### 23 



The heart of the wise instructs his mouth And adds [^m]persuasiveness to his lips. 







###### 24 



Pleasant words are a honeycomb, Sweet to the soul and healing to the bones. 







###### 25 



There is a way _which seems_ right to a person, But its end is the way of death. 







###### 26 



A worker's appetite works for him, For his [^n]hunger urges him _on_. 







###### 27 



A worthless person digs up evil, While [^o]his words are like scorching fire. 







###### 28 



A perverse person spreads strife, And a [^p]slanderer separates close friends. 







###### 29 



A person of violence entices his neighbor And leads him in a way that is not good. 







###### 30 



He who winks his eyes _does so_ to devise perverse things; He who compresses his lips brings evil to pass. 







###### 31 



A gray head is a crown of glory; It is found in the way of righteousness. 







###### 32 



One who is slow to anger is better than the mighty, And one who rules his spirit, than one who captures a city. 







###### 33 



The lot is cast into the lap, But its every decision is from the LORD. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

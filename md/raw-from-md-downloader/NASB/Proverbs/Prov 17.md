# Proverbs 17

***








###### 1 



Better is a dry morsel and quietness with it Than a house full of [^a]feasting with strife. 







###### 2 



A servant who acts wisely will rule over a son who acts shamefully, And will share in the inheritance among brothers. 







###### 3 



The refining pot is for silver and the furnace for gold, But the LORD tests hearts. 







###### 4 



An evildoer listens to wicked lips; A [^b]liar pays attention to a destructive tongue. 







###### 5 



One who mocks the poor taunts his Maker; One who rejoices at disaster will not go unpunished. 







###### 6 



Grandchildren are the crown of the old, And the glory of sons is their fathers. 







###### 7 



[^c]Excellent speech is not fitting for a fool, Much less are lying lips to a prince. 







###### 8 



A bribe is a [^d]charm in the sight of its owner; Wherever he turns, he prospers. 







###### 9 



One who conceals an offense seeks love, But one who repeats a matter separates close friends. 







###### 10 



A rebuke goes deeper into one who has understanding Than a hundred blows into a fool. 







###### 11 



A rebellious person seeks only evil, So a cruel messenger will be sent against him. 







###### 12 



Let a person meet a bear robbed of her cubs, Rather than a fool in his foolishness. 







###### 13 



One who returns evil for good, Evil will not depart from his house. 







###### 14 



The beginning of strife is _like_ letting out water, So abandon the quarrel before it breaks out. 







###### 15 



One who justifies the wicked and one who condemns the righteous, Both of them alike are an abomination to the LORD. 







###### 16 



Why is there money in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom, When [^e]he has no sense? 







###### 17 



A friend loves at all times, And a brother is born for adversity. 







###### 18 



A person lacking in [^f]sense shakes hands And becomes guarantor in the presence of his neighbor. 







###### 19 



One who loves wrongdoing loves strife; One who makes his doorway high seeks destruction. 







###### 20 



One who has a crooked [^g]mind finds nothing good, And one who is [^h]corrupted in his language falls into evil. 







###### 21 



He who fathers a fool _does so_ to his sorrow, And the father of a fool has no joy. 







###### 22 



A joyful heart [^i]is good medicine, But a broken spirit dries up the bones. 







###### 23 



A wicked person accepts a bribe [^j]from an inside pocket To pervert the ways of justice. 







###### 24 



Wisdom is in the presence of one who has understanding, But the eyes of a fool are on the ends of the earth. 







###### 25 



A foolish son is a grief to his father, And bitterness to her who gave birth to him. 







###### 26 



It is also not good to fine the righteous, _Nor_ to strike the noble for _their_ uprightness. 







###### 27 



One who withholds his words [^k]has knowledge, And one who has a cool spirit is a person of understanding. 







###### 28 



Even a fool, when he keeps silent, is considered wise; When he closes his lips, he is _considered_ prudent. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

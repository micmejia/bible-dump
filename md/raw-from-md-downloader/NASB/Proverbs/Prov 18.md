# Proverbs 18

***








###### 1 



One who separates himself seeks _his own_ desire; He [^a]quarrels against all sound wisdom. 







###### 2 



A fool does not delight in understanding, But in revealing his own [^b]mind. 







###### 3 



When a wicked person comes, contempt also comes, And with dishonor _comes_ taunting. 







###### 4 



The words of a person's mouth are deep waters; [^c]The fountain of wisdom is a bubbling brook. 







###### 5 



To show partiality to the wicked is not good, _Nor_ to suppress the righteous in judgment. 







###### 6 



A fool's lips [^d]bring strife, And his mouth invites beatings. 







###### 7 



A fool's mouth is his ruin, And his lips are the snare of his soul. 







###### 8 



The words of a gossiper are like dainty morsels, And they go down into the [^e]innermost parts of the body. 







###### 9 



He also who is lax in his work Is a brother to him who destroys. 







###### 10 



The name of the LORD is a strong tower; The righteous runs into it and is [^f]safe. 







###### 11 



A rich person's wealth is his strong city, And like a high wall in his own imagination. 







###### 12 



Before destruction the heart of a person is haughty, But humility _goes_ before honor. 







###### 13 



One who gives an answer before he hears, It is foolishness and shame to him. 







###### 14 



The spirit of a person can endure his sickness, But _as for_ a broken spirit, who can endure it? 







###### 15 



The [^g]mind of the discerning acquires knowledge, And the ear of the wise seeks knowledge. 







###### 16 



A person's gift makes room for him And brings him before great people. 







###### 17 



The first [^h]to plead his case _seems_ right, _Until_ [^i]another comes and examines him. 







###### 18 



The _cast_ lot puts an end to quarrels, And [^j]decides between the mighty ones. 







###### 19 



A brother who is offended _is harder to be won_ than a strong city, And quarrels are like the bars of a citadel. 







###### 20 



With the [^k]fruit of a person's mouth his stomach will be satisfied; He will be satisfied _with_ the product of his lips. 







###### 21 



Death and life are in the [^l]power of the tongue, And those who love it will eat its fruit. 







###### 22 



He who finds a wife finds a good thing And obtains favor from the LORD. 







###### 23 



A poor person utters pleadings, But a rich person answers defiantly. 







###### 24 



A person of _too many_ friends _comes_ to [^m]ruin, But there is a friend who sticks _closer_ than a brother. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

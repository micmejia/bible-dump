# Proverbs 19

***








###### 1 



Better is a poor person who walks in his integrity Than a person who is perverse in [^a]speech and is a fool. 







###### 2 



Also it is not good for a person to be without knowledge, And one who hurries [^b]his footsteps [^c]errs. 







###### 3 



The foolishness of a person ruins his way, And his heart rages against the LORD. 







###### 4 



Wealth adds many friends, But a poor person is separated from his friend. 







###### 5 



A false witness will not go unpunished, And one _who_ declares lies will not escape. 







###### 6 



Many will seek the favor of a [^d]generous person, And every person is a friend to him who _gives_ gifts. 







###### 7 



All the brothers of a poor person hate him; How much more do his friends abandon him! He pursues _them with_ words, _but_ they are [^e]gone. 







###### 8 



One who gets [^f]wisdom loves his own soul; One who keeps understanding will find good. 







###### 9 



A false witness will not go unpunished, And one _who_ declares lies will perish. 







###### 10 



Luxury is not fitting for a fool; Much less for a slave to rule over princes. 







###### 11 



A person's discretion makes him slow to anger, And it is his glory to overlook an offense. 







###### 12 



A king's wrath is like the roaring of a lion, But his favor is like dew on the grass. 







###### 13 



A foolish son is destruction to his father, And the quarrels of a wife are a constant dripping. 







###### 14 



House and wealth are an inheritance from fathers, But a prudent wife is from the LORD. 







###### 15 



Laziness casts _one_ into a deep sleep, And [^g]a lazy [^h]person will suffer hunger. 







###### 16 



One who keeps the commandment keeps his soul, _But_ one who [^i]is careless of [^j]conduct will die. 







###### 17 



One who is gracious to a poor person lends to the LORD, And He will repay him for his [^k]good deed. 







###### 18 



Discipline your son while there is hope, And do not desire [^l]his death. 







###### 19 



_A person of_ great anger will suffer the penalty, For if you rescue _him_, you will only have to do it again. 







###### 20 



Listen to advice and accept discipline, So that you may be wise [^m]the rest of your days. 







###### 21 



Many plans are in a person's heart, But the advice of the LORD will stand. 







###### 22 



What is desirable in a person is his [^n]kindness, And _it is_ better to be a poor person than a liar. 







###### 23 



[^o]The fear of the LORD _leads_ to life, So that one may sleep satisfied, [^p]untouched by evil. 







###### 24 



The [^q]lazy one buries his hand in the dish, _But_ will not even bring it back to his mouth. 







###### 25 



Strike a scoffer and the naive may become clever, But rebuke one who has understanding, _and_ he will [^r]gain knowledge. 







###### 26 



He who assaults _his_ father _and_ drives _his_ mother away Is a shameful and disgraceful son. 







###### 27 



Stop listening, my son, to discipline, _And you will_ stray from the words of knowledge. 







###### 28 



A worthless witness makes a mockery of justice, And the mouth of the wicked [^s]swallows wrongdoing. 







###### 29 



[^t]Judgments are prepared for scoffers, And beatings for the backs of fools. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Proverbs 2

***








###### 1 



My son, if you will receive my words And treasure my commandments within you, 







###### 2 



Make your ear attentive to wisdom; Incline your heart to understanding. 







###### 3 



For if you cry out for insight, _And_ [^a]raise your voice for understanding; 







###### 4 



If you seek her as silver And search for her as for hidden treasures; 







###### 5 



Then you will understand the fear of the LORD, And discover the knowledge of God. 







###### 6 



For the LORD gives wisdom; From His mouth _come_ knowledge and understanding. 







###### 7 



He stores up sound wisdom for the upright; _He is_ a shield to those who walk in integrity, 







###### 8 



Guarding the paths of justice, And He watches over the way of His godly ones. 







###### 9 



Then you will discern righteousness, justice, And integrity, _and_ every good path. 







###### 10 



For wisdom will enter your heart, And knowledge will be delightful to your soul; 







###### 11 



Discretion will watch over you, Understanding will guard you, 







###### 12 



To rescue you from the way of evil, From a person who speaks perverse things; 







###### 13 



_From_ those who leave the paths of uprightness To walk in the ways of darkness; 







###### 14 



Who delight in doing evil _And_ rejoice in the perversity of evil; 







###### 15 



Whose paths are crooked, And who are devious in their ways; 







###### 16 



To rescue you from the strange woman, From the foreign woman who flatters with her words, 







###### 17 



Who leaves the companion of her youth And forgets the covenant of her God; 







###### 18 



For her house sinks down to death, And her tracks _lead_ to the [^b]dead; 







###### 19 



None who go to her return, Nor do they reach the paths of life. 







###### 20 



So you will walk in the way of good people And keep to the paths of the righteous. 







###### 21 



For the upright will live in the land, And the blameless will remain in it; 







###### 22 



But the wicked will be eliminated from the land, And the treacherous will be torn away from it. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Proverbs 20

***








###### 1 



Wine is a mocker, intoxicating drink a brawler, And whoever [^a]is intoxicated by it is not wise. 







###### 2 



The terror of a king is like the roaring of a lion; One who provokes him to anger [^b]forfeits his own life. 







###### 3 



Avoiding strife is an honor for a person, But any fool will [^c]quarrel. 







###### 4 



The [^d]lazy one does not plow after the autumn, So he [^e]begs during the harvest and has nothing. 







###### 5 



A plan in the heart of a person is _like_ deep water, But a person of understanding draws it out. 







###### 6 



Many a person proclaims his own loyalty, But who can find a trustworthy person? 







###### 7 



A righteous person who walks in his integrity-- How blessed are his sons after him. 







###### 8 



A king who sits on the throne of justice [^f]Disperses all evil with his eyes. 







###### 9 



Who can say, "I have cleansed my heart, I am pure from my sin"? 







###### 10 



[^g]Differing weights and differing measures, Both of them are abominable to the LORD. 







###### 11 



It is by his deeds that a boy [^h]distinguishes himself, If his conduct is pure and right. 







###### 12 



The hearing ear and the seeing eye, The LORD has made both of them. 







###### 13 



Do not love sleep, or you will become poor; Open your eyes, _and you will_ be satisfied with [^i]food. 







###### 14 



"Bad, bad," says the buyer, But when he goes his way, then he boasts. 







###### 15 



There is gold, and an abundance of [^j]jewels; But lips of knowledge are a _more_ precious thing. 







###### 16 



Take his garment when he becomes guarantor for a stranger; And for foreigners, seize a pledge from him. 







###### 17 



Bread _obtained by_ a lie is sweet to a person, But afterward his mouth will be filled with gravel. 







###### 18 



Prepare plans by consultation, And make war by wise guidance. 







###### 19 



One who goes about as a slanderer reveals secrets; Therefore do not associate with [^k]a gossip. 







###### 20 



He who curses his father or his mother, His lamp will go out in time of darkness. 







###### 21 



An inheritance gained in a hurry at the beginning Will not be blessed in the end. 







###### 22 



Do not say, "I will repay evil"; Wait for the LORD, and He will save you. 







###### 23 



[^l]Differing weights are an abomination to the LORD, And a [^m]false scale is not good. 







###### 24 



A man's steps are _ordained_ by the LORD; How then can a person understand his way? 







###### 25 



It is a trap for a person to say carelessly, "It is holy!" And after the vows to make inquiry. 







###### 26 



A wise king scatters the wicked, And [^n]drives a _threshing_ wheel over them. 







###### 27 



The [^o]spirit of a person is the lamp of the LORD, Searching all the [^p]innermost parts of his being. 







###### 28 



[^q]Loyalty and truth watch over the king, And he upholds his throne by [^r]loyalty. 







###### 29 



The glory of young men is their strength, And the [^s]honor of old men is their gray hair. 







###### 30 



Bruising wounds clean away evil, And blows _cleanse_ the [^t]innermost parts. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

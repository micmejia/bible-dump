# Proverbs 21

***








###### 1 



The king's heart is _like_ channels of water in the hand of the LORD; He turns it wherever He pleases. 







###### 2 



Every person's way is right in his own eyes, But the LORD examines the hearts. 







###### 3 



To do righteousness and justice Is preferred by the LORD more than sacrifice. 







###### 4 



Haughty eyes and a proud heart, The lamp of the wicked, is sin. 







###### 5 



The plans of the diligent certainly _lead_ to advantage, But everyone who is in a hurry certainly _comes_ to poverty. 







###### 6 



The acquisition of treasures by a lying tongue Is a fleeting vapor, the [^a]pursuit of death. 







###### 7 



The violence of the wicked will sweep them away, Because they refuse to act with justice. 







###### 8 



The way of a guilty person is crooked, But as for the pure, his conduct is upright. 







###### 9 



It is better to live on a corner of a roof Than [^b]in a house shared with a contentious woman. 







###### 10 



The soul of the wicked desires evil; His neighbor is shown no compassion in his eyes. 







###### 11 



When the scoffer is punished, the naive becomes wise; But when the wise is instructed, he receives knowledge. 







###### 12 



The [^c]righteous one considers the house of the wicked, Bringing the wicked to ruin. 







###### 13 



One who shuts his ear to the outcry of the poor Will also call out himself, and not be answered. 







###### 14 



A gift in secret subdues anger, And a bribe [^d]in an inside pocket, strong wrath. 







###### 15 



The exercise of justice is joy for the righteous, But terror to those who practice injustice. 







###### 16 



A person who wanders from the way of understanding Will rest in the assembly of the [^e]dead. 







###### 17 



One who loves pleasure _will become_ a poor person; One who loves wine and oil will not become rich. 







###### 18 



The wicked is a ransom for the righteous, And the treacherous is in the place of the upright. 







###### 19 



It is better to live in a desert land Than with a contentious and irritating woman. 







###### 20 



There is precious treasure and oil in the home of the wise, But a foolish person swallows it up. 







###### 21 



One who pursues righteousness and loyalty Finds life, righteousness, and honor. 







###### 22 



A wise person scales the city of the mighty And brings down the [^f]stronghold in which they trust. 







###### 23 



One who guards his mouth and his tongue, Guards his soul from troubles. 







###### 24 



"Proud," "Arrogant," "Scoffer," are his names, _One_ who acts with insolent pride. 







###### 25 



The desire of the [^g]lazy one puts him to death, For his hands refuse to work; 







###### 26 



All day long he [^h]is craving, While the righteous gives and does not hold back. 







###### 27 



The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination, How much more when he brings it with evil intent! 







###### 28 



A false witness will perish, But a person who listens will speak forever. 







###### 29 



A wicked person [^i]displays a bold face, But as for the upright, he makes his way sure. 







###### 30 



There is no wisdom, no understanding, And no [^j]plan against the LORD. 







###### 31 



The horse is prepared for the day of battle, But the victory belongs to the LORD. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Proverbs 22

***








###### 1 



A _good_ name is to be more desired than great wealth; Favor is better than silver and gold. 







###### 2 



The rich and the poor [^a]have a common bond, The LORD is the Maker of them all. 







###### 3 



A prudent person sees evil and hides himself, But the naive proceed, and pay the penalty. 







###### 4 



The reward of humility _and_ [^b]the fear of the LORD Are riches, honor, and life. 







###### 5 



Thorns _and_ snares are in the way of the perverse; One who guards himself will be far from them. 







###### 6 



Train up a child [^c]in the way he should go, Even when he grows older he will not abandon it. 







###### 7 



The rich rules over the poor, And the borrower _becomes_ the lender's slave. 







###### 8 



One who sows injustice will reap disaster, And the rod of his fury will perish. 







###### 9 



One who [^d]is generous will be blessed, Because he gives some of his food to the poor. 







###### 10 



Drive out the scoffer, and strife will leave, Even quarreling and dishonor will cease. 







###### 11 



One who loves purity of heart _And_ [^e]whose speech is gracious, the king is his friend. 







###### 12 



The eyes of the LORD protect knowledge, But He overthrows the words of the treacherous person. 







###### 13 



The [^f]lazy one says, "There is a lion outside; I will be killed in the streets!" 







###### 14 



The mouth of [^g]an adulteress is a deep pit; He who is cursed of the LORD will fall [^h]into it. 







###### 15 



Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child; The rod of discipline will remove it far from him. 







###### 16 



One who oppresses the poor to make [^i]more for himself, _Or_ gives to the rich, _will_ only _come_ to poverty. 







###### 17 



Extend your ear and hear the words of the wise, And apply your mind to my knowledge; 







###### 18 



For it will be pleasant if you keep them within you, [^j]So that they may be ready on your lips. 







###### 19 



So that your trust may be in the LORD, I have [^k]taught you today, you indeed. 







###### 20 



Have I not written to you [^l]excellent things Of counsels and knowledge, 







###### 21 



To make you know the [^m]certainty of the words of truth, So that you may [^n]correctly answer him who sent you? 







###### 22 



Do not rob the poor because he is poor, Nor crush the needy at the gate; 







###### 23 



For the LORD will plead their case And [^o]take the life of those who rob them. 







###### 24 



Do not make friends with a person _given_ to anger, Or go with a hot-tempered person, 







###### 25 



Or you will learn his ways And [^p]find a snare for yourself. 







###### 26 



Do not be among those who shake hands, Among those who become guarantors for debts. 







###### 27 



If you have nothing with which to repay, Why should he take your bed from under you? 







###### 28 



Do not move the ancient boundary Which your fathers have set. 







###### 29 



Do you see a person skilled in his work? He will stand before kings; He will not stand before obscure people. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

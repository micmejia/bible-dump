# Proverbs 23

***








###### 1 



When you sit down to dine with a ruler, Consider carefully [^a]what is before you, 







###### 2 



And put a knife to your throat If you are a person of _great_ appetite. 







###### 3 



Do not desire his delicacies, For it is deceptive food. 







###### 4 



Do not weary yourself to gain wealth; [^b]Stop dwelling _on it_. 







###### 5 



[^c]When you set your eyes on it, it is gone. For _wealth_ certainly makes itself wings Like an eagle that flies _toward_ the heavens. 







###### 6 



Do not eat the bread of [^d]a selfish person; Or desire his delicacies; 







###### 7 



For as he [^e]thinks within himself, so he is. He says to you, "Eat and drink!" But his heart is not with you. 







###### 8 



You will vomit up [^f]the morsel you have eaten And waste your [^g]compliments. 







###### 9 



Do not speak [^h]to be heard by a fool, For he will despise the wisdom of your words. 







###### 10 



Do not move the ancient boundary Or go into the fields of the fatherless, 







###### 11 



For their Redeemer is strong; He will plead their case against you. 







###### 12 



Apply your heart to discipline, And your ears to words of knowledge. 







###### 13 



Do not withhold discipline from a child; Though you strike him with the rod, he will not die. 







###### 14 



You shall strike him with the rod And rescue his soul from Sheol. 







###### 15 



My son, if your heart is wise, My own heart also will be glad, 







###### 16 



And my [^i]innermost being will rejoice When your lips speak what is right. 







###### 17 



Do not let your heart envy sinners, But _live_ in [^j]the fear of the LORD [^k]always. 







###### 18 



Certainly there is a [^l]future, And your hope will not be cut off. 







###### 19 



Listen, my son, and be wise, And direct your heart in the way. 







###### 20 



Do not be with heavy drinkers of wine, _Or_ with gluttonous eaters of meat; 







###### 21 



For the heavy drinker and the glutton will come to poverty, And drowsiness will clothe _one_ with rags. 







###### 22 



Listen to your father, who fathered you, And do not despise your mother when she is old. 







###### 23 



Buy truth, and do not sell _it_, _Get_ wisdom, instruction, and understanding. 







###### 24 



The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice, And he who fathers a wise son will be glad in him. 







###### 25 



Let your father and your mother be glad, And let her rejoice who gave birth to you. 







###### 26 



Give me your heart, my son, And let your eyes [^m]delight in my ways. 







###### 27 



For a prostitute is a deep pit, And a [^n]strange woman is a narrow well. 







###### 28 



Certainly she lurks as a robber, And increases the treacherous among mankind. 







###### 29 



Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has contentions? Who has complaining? Who has wounds without cause? Who has red eyes? 







###### 30 



Those who linger long over wine, Those who go to [^o]taste mixed wine. 







###### 31 



Do not look at wine when it is red, When it [^p]sparkles in the cup, _When_ it goes down smoothly; 







###### 32 



In the end it bites like a snake And stings like a viper. 







###### 33 



Your eyes will see strange things And your [^q]mind will say perverse things. 







###### 34 



And you will be like one who lies down in the [^r]middle of the sea, Or like one who lies down on the top of a [^s]mast. 







###### 35 



"They struck me, _but_ I did not become [^t]ill; They beat me, _but_ I did not know _it_. When will I awake? I will seek [^u]another drink." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

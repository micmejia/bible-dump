# Proverbs 24

***








###### 1 



Do not be envious of evil people, Nor desire to be with them; 







###### 2 



For their [^a]minds plot violence, And their lips talk of trouble. 







###### 3 



By wisdom a house is built, And by understanding it is established; 







###### 4 



And by knowledge the rooms are filled With all precious and pleasant riches. 







###### 5 



A wise man is [^b]strong, And a person of knowledge [^c]increases power. 







###### 6 



For by wise guidance you will [^d]wage war, And in an abundance of counselors there is victory. 







###### 7 



Wisdom is _too_ exalted for a fool, He does not open his mouth at the gate. 







###### 8 



One who plans to do evil, _People_ will call a [^e]schemer. 







###### 9 



The devising of foolishness is sin, And the scoffer is an abomination to humanity. 







###### 10 



_If_ you show yourself lacking courage on the day of distress, Your strength is meager. 







###### 11 



Rescue those who are being taken away to death, And those who are staggering to the slaughter, Oh hold _them_ back! 







###### 12 



If you say, "See, we did not know this," Does He who weighs the hearts not consider _it_? And does He who watches over your soul not know _it_? And will He not [^f]repay a person according to his work? 







###### 13 



My son, eat honey, for it is good; Yes, the honey from the comb is sweet to your taste; 







###### 14 



Know _that_ wisdom is the same for your soul; If you find _it_, then there will be a [^g]future, And your hope will not be cut off. 







###### 15 



Do not lie in ambush, you wicked person, against the home of the righteous; Do not destroy his resting place; 







###### 16 



For a righteous person falls seven times and rises again, But the wicked stumble in _time of_ disaster. 







###### 17 



Do not rejoice when your enemy falls, And do not let your heart rejoice when he stumbles, 







###### 18 



Otherwise, the LORD will see and [^h]be displeased, And turn His anger away from him. 







###### 19 



Do not get upset because of evildoers Or be envious of the wicked; 







###### 20 



For there will be no [^i]future for the evil person; The lamp of the wicked will be put out. 







###### 21 



My son, [^j]fear the LORD and the king; Do not get involved with those [^k]of high rank, 







###### 22 



For their disaster will rise suddenly, And who knows the ruin _that can come_ from both of them? 







###### 23 



These also are _sayings_ of the wise: To [^l]show partiality in judgment is not good. 







###### 24 



One who says to the wicked, "You are righteous," Peoples will curse him, nations will scold him; 







###### 25 



But for those who rebuke the _wicked_ there will be delight, And a good blessing will come upon them. 







###### 26 



One who gives [^m]a right answer Kisses the lips. 







###### 27 



Prepare your work outside, And make it ready for yourself in the field; Afterward, then, build your house. 







###### 28 



Do not be a witness against your neighbor for no reason, And do not deceive with your lips. 







###### 29 



Do not say, "I shall do the same to him as he has done to me; I will [^n]repay the person according to his work." 







###### 30 



I passed by the field of [^o]a lazy one, And by the vineyard of a person lacking [^p]sense, 







###### 31 



And behold, it was completely overgrown with weeds; Its surface was covered with weeds, And its stone wall was broken down. 







###### 32 



When I saw, I [^q]reflected upon it; I looked, _and_ received instruction. 







###### 33 



"A little sleep, a little slumber, A little folding of the hands to rest," 







###### 34 



Then your poverty will come like [^r]a drifter, And your need like [^s]an armed man. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

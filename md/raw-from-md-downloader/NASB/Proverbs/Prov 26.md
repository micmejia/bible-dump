# Proverbs 26

***








###### 1 



Like snow in summer and like rain in harvest, So honor is not fitting for a fool. 







###### 2 



Like a sparrow in _its_ [^a]flitting, like a swallow in _its_ flying, So a curse without cause does not come _to rest_. 







###### 3 



A whip is for the horse, a bridle for the donkey, And a rod for the back of fools. 







###### 4 



Do not answer a fool [^b]according to his foolishness, Or you will also be like him. 







###### 5 



Answer a fool as his foolishness _deserves_, So that he will not be wise in his own eyes. 







###### 6 



One who sends a message by the hand of a fool Chops off _his own_ feet _and_ drinks violence. 







###### 7 



_Like_ [^c]useless legs to one who cannot walk, So is a proverb in the mouths of fools. 







###### 8 



Like [^d]one who binds a stone in a sling, So is one who gives honor to a fool. 







###### 9 



_Like_ a thorn _that_ [^e]sticks in the hand of a heavy drinker, So is a proverb in the mouths of fools. 







###### 10 



[^f]_Like_ an archer who wounds everyone, So is one who hires a fool or hires those who pass by. 







###### 11 



Like a dog that returns to its vomit, So is a fool who repeats [^g]his foolishness. 







###### 12 



Do you see a person wise in his own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than for him. 







###### 13 



[^h]A lazy one says, "There is a lion on the road! A lion is [^i]in the public square!" 







###### 14 



_As_ the door turns on its hinges, So _does_ a lazy one on his bed. 







###### 15 



A lazy one buries his hand in the dish; He is weary of bringing it to his mouth again. 







###### 16 



A lazy one is wiser in his own eyes Than seven _people_ who can [^j]give a discreet answer. 







###### 17 



_Like_ one who takes a dog by the ears, _So_ is one who passes by _and_ [^k]meddles with strife not belonging to him. 







###### 18 



Like a maniac who shoots Flaming arrows, arrows, and death, 







###### 19 



So is a person who deceives his neighbor, And says, "Was I not joking?" 







###### 20 



For lack of wood the fire goes out, And where there is no gossiper, quarreling quiets down. 







###### 21 



_Like_ charcoal to hot embers and wood to fire, So is a contentious person to kindle strife. 







###### 22 



The words of a gossiper are like dainty morsels, And they go down into the [^l]innermost parts of the body. 







###### 23 



_Like_ an earthenware vessel overlaid with silver [^m]impurities Are burning lips and a wicked heart. 







###### 24 



One who hates disguises _it_ with his lips, But he harbors deceit in his [^n]heart. 







###### 25 



When [^o]he speaks graciously, do not believe him, Because there are seven abominations in his heart. 







###### 26 



_Though his_ hatred covers itself with deception, His wickedness will be revealed in the assembly. 







###### 27 



One who digs a pit will fall into it, And one who rolls a stone, it will come back on him. 







###### 28 



A lying tongue hates [^p]those it crushes, And a flattering mouth works ruin. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Proverbs 27

***








###### 1 



Do not boast about tomorrow, For you do not know what a day may bring. 







###### 2 



Let another praise you, and not your own mouth; A stranger, and not your own lips. 







###### 3 



A stone is heavy and the sand weighty, But the provocation of a fool is heavier than both of them. 







###### 4 



Wrath is fierce and anger is a flood, But who can stand before jealousy? 







###### 5 



Better is open rebuke Than love that is concealed. 







###### 6 



Faithful are the wounds of a friend, But [^a]deceitful are the kisses of an enemy. 







###### 7 



A satisfied [^b]person [^c]despises honey, But to a hungry [^d]person any bitter thing is sweet. 







###### 8 



Like a bird that wanders from its nest, So is a person who wanders from his [^e]home. 







###### 9 



Oil and perfume make the heart glad, And a [^f]person's advice is sweet to his friend. 







###### 10 



Do not abandon your friend or your father's friend, And do not go to your brother's house on the day of your disaster; Better is a neighbor who is near than a brother far away. 







###### 11 



Be wise, my son, and make my heart glad, So that I may reply to one who taunts me. 







###### 12 



A prudent person sees evil _and_ hides himself; _But_ the naive proceed, _and_ pay the penalty. 







###### 13 



Take his garment when he becomes a guarantor for a stranger; And for a foreign woman seize a pledge from him. 







###### 14 



One who blesses his friend with a loud voice early in the morning, It will be considered a curse to him. 







###### 15 



A constant dripping on a day of steady rain And a contentious woman are alike; 







###### 16 



He who would [^g]restrain her [^h]restrains the wind, And [^i]grasps oil with his right hand. 







###### 17 



_As_ iron sharpens iron, So one person sharpens another. 







###### 18 



One who tends the fig tree will eat its fruit, And one who cares for his master will be honored. 







###### 19 



As in water a face _reflects_ the face, So the heart of a person _reflects the_ person. 







###### 20 



[^j]Sheol and [^k]Abaddon are never satisfied, Nor are the eyes of a person ever satisfied. 







###### 21 



The crucible is for silver and the furnace for gold, And each _is tested_ by the praise accorded him. 







###### 22 



Though you pound the fool in a mortar with a pestle along with crushed grain, His foolishness _still_ will not leave him. 







###### 23 



Know well the [^l]condition of your flocks, _And_ pay attention to your herds; 







###### 24 



For riches are not forever, Nor does a crown _endure_ to all generations. 







###### 25 



_When_ the grass disappears, the new growth is seen, And the herbs of the mountains are gathered in, 







###### 26 



The lambs _will be_ for your clothing, And the goats _will bring_ the price of a field, 







###### 27 



And _there will be_ enough goats' milk for your food, For the food of your household, And sustenance for your attendants. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Proverbs 28

***








###### 1 



The wicked flee when no one is pursuing, But the righteous are [^a]bold as a lion. 







###### 2 



Due to a [^b]wrongdoing of [^c]a land its leaders are many, But by a person of understanding _and_ knowledge, so it endures. 







###### 3 



A poor man who oppresses the helpless Is _like_ a driving rain [^d]which leaves no food. 







###### 4 



Those who abandon the Law praise the wicked, But those who keep the Law strive against them. 







###### 5 



Evil people do not understand justice, But those who seek the LORD understand everything. 







###### 6 



Better is a poor person who walks in his integrity, Than a person who is [^e]crooked, though he is rich. 







###### 7 



He who keeps the Law is a discerning son, But he who is a companion of gluttons humiliates his father. 







###### 8 



One who increases his wealth by [^f]interest _of any kind_, Collects it for one who is gracious to the poor. 







###### 9 



One who turns his ear away from listening to the Law, Even his prayer is an abomination. 







###### 10 



One who leads the upright astray in an evil way Will himself fall into his own pit, But the blameless will inherit good. 







###### 11 



The rich person is wise in his own eyes, But the poor who has understanding [^g]sees through him. 







###### 12 



When the righteous triumph, there is great glory, But when the wicked rise, people [^h]hide themselves. 







###### 13 



One who conceals his wrongdoings will not prosper, But one who confesses and abandons _them_ will find compassion. 







###### 14 



How blessed is the person who fears always, But one who hardens his heart will fall into disaster. 







###### 15 



_Like_ a roaring lion and a rushing bear Is a wicked ruler over a poor people. 







###### 16 



A leader who is a great oppressor lacks understanding, _But_ a person who hates unjust gain will prolong _his_ days. 







###### 17 



A person who is burdened with the guilt of human blood Will [^i]be a fugitive until death; no one is to support him! 







###### 18 



One who walks blamelessly will receive help, But one who is [^j]crooked will fall all at once. 







###### 19 



One who works his land will have plenty of food, But one who follows empty _pursuits_ will have plenty of poverty. 







###### 20 



A faithful person will abound with blessings, But one who hurries to be rich will not go unpunished. 







###### 21 



To [^k]show partiality is not good, Because for a piece of bread a man will do wrong. 







###### 22 



A person with an evil eye hurries after wealth And does not know that poverty will come upon him. 







###### 23 



One who rebukes a person will afterward find _more_ favor Than one who flatters with the tongue. 







###### 24 



He who robs his father or his mother And says, "There is no wrong done," Is the companion of a person who destroys. 







###### 25 



An [^l]arrogant person stirs up strife, But one who trusts in the LORD will [^m]prosper. 







###### 26 



One who trusts in his own heart is a fool, But one who walks wisely will flee to safety. 







###### 27 



One who gives to the poor will never lack _anything_, But one who [^n]shuts his eyes will have many curses. 







###### 28 



When the wicked rise, people hide themselves; But when they perish, the righteous increase. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

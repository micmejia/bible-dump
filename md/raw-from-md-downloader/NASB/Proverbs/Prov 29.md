# Proverbs 29

***








###### 1 



A person [^a]often rebuked who [^b]becomes obstinate Will suddenly be broken [^c]beyond remedy. 







###### 2 



When the righteous [^d]increase, the people rejoice, But when a wicked person rules, people groan. 







###### 3 



A man who loves wisdom makes his father glad, But he who involves himself with prostitutes wastes _his_ wealth. 







###### 4 



The king gives stability to the land by justice, But a person who takes bribes ruins it. 







###### 5 



A man who flatters his neighbor Is spreading a net for his steps. 







###### 6 



By wrongdoing an evil person is ensnared, But the righteous sings and rejoices. 







###### 7 



The righteous [^e]is concerned for the rights of the poor; The wicked does not understand _such_ [^f]concern. 







###### 8 



Arrogant people inflame a city, But wise people turn away anger. 







###### 9 



When a wise person has a controversy with a foolish person, [^g]The foolish person either rages or laughs, and there is no rest. 







###### 10 



People of bloodshed hate the blameless person, But the upright [^h]are concerned for his life. 







###### 11 



A fool [^i]always loses his temper, But a wise person holds it back. 







###### 12 



If a ruler pays attention to falsehood, All his ministers _become_ wicked. 







###### 13 



The poor person and the oppressor [^j]have this in common: The LORD gives light to the eyes of both. 







###### 14 



If a king judges the poor with truth, His throne will be established forever. 







###### 15 



The rod and a rebuke give wisdom, But a child [^k]who gets his own way brings shame to his mother. 







###### 16 



When the wicked [^l]increase, wrongdoing increases; But the righteous will see their downfall. 







###### 17 



Correct your son, and he will give you comfort; He will also [^m]delight your soul. 







###### 18 



Where there is no [^n]vision, the people are unrestrained, But happy is one who keeps the Law. 







###### 19 



A slave will not be instructed by words _alone_; For _though_ he understands, there will be no response. 







###### 20 



Do you see a person who is hasty with his words? There is more hope for a fool than for him. 







###### 21 



One who pampers his slave from childhood Will in the end _find_ him to be rebellious. 







###### 22 



An angry person stirs up strife, And a hot-tempered person abounds in wrongdoing. 







###### 23 



A person's pride will bring him low, But a humble spirit will obtain honor. 







###### 24 



One who is a partner with a thief hates his own life; He hears the oath but tells nothing. 







###### 25 



The fear of man [^o]brings a snare, But one who trusts in the LORD will be protected. 







###### 26 



Many seek the ruler's [^p]favor, But justice for mankind _comes_ from the LORD. 







###### 27 



An unjust person is an abomination to the righteous, And one who is upright in the way is an abomination to the wicked. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

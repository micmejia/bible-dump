# Proverbs 3

***








###### 1 



My son, do not forget my [^a]teaching, But have your heart comply with my commandments; 







###### 2 



For length of days and years of life And peace they will add to you. 







###### 3 



Do not let kindness and truth leave you; Bind them around your neck, Write them on the tablet of your heart. 







###### 4 



So you will find favor and a good [^b]reputation In the sight of God and man. 







###### 5 



Trust in the LORD with all your heart And do not lean on your own understanding. 







###### 6 



In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He will make your paths straight. 







###### 7 



Do not be wise in your own eyes; Fear the LORD and turn away from evil. 







###### 8 



It will be healing to your [^c]body And refreshment to your bones. 







###### 9 



Honor the LORD from your wealth, And from the first of all your produce; 







###### 10 



Then your barns will be filled with plenty, And your vats will overflow with new wine. 







###### 11 



My son, do not reject the [^d]discipline of the LORD Or loathe His rebuke, 







###### 12 



For whom the LORD loves He disciplines, _Just_ as a father _disciplines_ the son in whom he delights. 







###### 13 



Blessed is a person who finds wisdom, And one who obtains understanding. 







###### 14 



For [^e]her profit is better than the profit of silver, And her produce better than gold. 







###### 15 



She is more precious than [^f]jewels, And nothing you desire compares with her. 







###### 16 



[^g]Long life is in her right hand; In her left hand are riches and honor. 







###### 17 



Her ways are pleasant ways, And all her paths are peace. 







###### 18 



She is a tree of life to those who take hold of her, And happy are those who hold on to her. 







###### 19 



The LORD founded the earth by wisdom, He established the heavens by understanding. 







###### 20 



By His knowledge the ocean depths were burst open, And the clouds drip with dew. 







###### 21 



My son, _see that_ they do not escape from your sight; Comply with sound wisdom and discretion, 







###### 22 



And they will be life to your soul And adornment to your neck. 







###### 23 



Then you will walk in your way securely, And your foot will not stumble. 







###### 24 



When you lie down, you will not be afraid; When you lie down, your sleep will be sweet. 







###### 25 



Do not be afraid of sudden danger, Nor of trouble from the wicked when it comes; 







###### 26 



For the LORD will be [^h]your confidence, And will keep your foot from being caught. 







###### 27 



Do not withhold good from [^i]those to whom it is due, When it is in your power to do _it_. 







###### 28 



Do not say to your neighbor, "Go, and come back, And tomorrow I will give _it to you_," When you have it with you. 







###### 29 



Do not devise harm against your neighbor, While he lives securely beside you. 







###### 30 



Do not contend with a person for no reason, If he has done you no harm. 







###### 31 



Do not envy a violent person, And do not choose any of his ways. 







###### 32 



For the devious are an abomination to the LORD; But [^j]He is intimate with the upright. 







###### 33 



The curse of the LORD is on the house of the wicked, But He blesses the home of the righteous. 







###### 34 



Though He scoffs at the scoffers, Yet He gives grace to the needy. 







###### 35 



The wise will inherit honor, But fools [^k]increase dishonor. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

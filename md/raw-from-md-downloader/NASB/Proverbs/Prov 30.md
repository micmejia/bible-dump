# Proverbs 30

***








###### 1 



The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, the pronouncement. The man declares to Ithiel, to Ithiel and Ucal: 







###### 2 



I am certainly more stupid than any man, And I do not have the understanding of a man; 







###### 3 



Nor have I learned wisdom, Nor do I have the knowledge of the Holy One. 







###### 4 



Who has ascended into heaven and descended? Who has gathered the wind in His fists? Who has wrapped the waters in [^a]His garment? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is His name or His [^b]Son's name? Surely you know! 







###### 5 



Every word of God is [^c]pure; He is a shield to those who take refuge in Him. 







###### 6 



Do not add to His words Or He will rebuke you, and you will be proved a liar. 







###### 7 



Two things I have asked of You; Do not refuse me before I die: 







###### 8 



Keep deception and [^d]lies far from me, Give me neither poverty nor riches; Feed me with the food that is my portion, 







###### 9 



So that I will not be full and deny _You_ and say, "Who is the LORD?" And that I will not become impoverished and steal, And profane the name of my God. 







###### 10 



Do not slander a slave to his master, Or he will curse you and you will be found guilty. 







###### 11 



There is a [^e]kind _of person_ who curses his father And does not bless his mother. 







###### 12 



There is a [^f]kind who is pure in his own eyes, Yet is not washed from his filthiness. 







###### 13 



There is a [^g]kind--oh how lofty are his eyes! And his eyelids are raised _in arrogance_. 







###### 14 



There is a [^h]kind _of person_ whose teeth are _like_ swords And his jaw teeth _like_ knives, To devour the poor from the earth And the needy from among mankind. 







###### 15 



The leech has two daughters: "Give" _and_ "Give." There are three things that will not be satisfied, Four that will not say, "Enough": 







###### 16 



[^i]Sheol, the infertile womb, Earth that is never satisfied with water, And fire that never says, "Enough." 







###### 17 



The eye that mocks a father And [^j]scorns a mother, The ravens of the valley will pick it out, And the young eagles will eat it. 







###### 18 



There are three things which are too wonderful for me, Four which I do not understand: 







###### 19 



The way of the eagle in the sky, The way of a snake on a rock, The way of a ship in the middle of the sea, And the way of a man with a [^k]virgin. 







###### 20 



This is the way of an adulterous woman: She eats and wipes her mouth, And says, "I have done no wrong." 







###### 21 



Under three things the earth quakes, And under four, it cannot endure: 







###### 22 



Under a slave when he becomes king, And a fool when he is satisfied with food, 







###### 23 



Under an unloved woman when she gets a husband, And a female servant when she dispossesses her mistress. 







###### 24 



Four things are small on the earth, But they are exceedingly wise: 







###### 25 



The ants are not a strong people, But they prepare their food in the summer; 







###### 26 



The rock hyraxes are not a mighty people, Yet they make their houses in the rocks; 







###### 27 



The locusts have no king, Yet all of them go out in ranks; 







###### 28 



The lizard you may grasp with the hands, Yet it is in kings' palaces. 







###### 29 



There are three things which are stately in _their_ march, Even four which are stately when they walk: 







###### 30 



The lion, _which_ is mighty among animals And does not [^l]retreat from anything, 







###### 31 



The [^m]strutting rooster or the male goat, And a king _when his_ army is with him. 







###### 32 



If you have been foolish in exalting yourself, Or if you have plotted _evil_, _put your_ hand on your mouth. 







###### 33 



For the [^n]churning of milk produces butter, And pressing the nose produces blood; So the [^o]churning of anger produces strife. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Proverbs 31

***








###### 1 



The words of King Lemuel, the pronouncement which his mother taught him: 







###### 2 



What, my son? And what, son of my womb? And what, son of my vows? 







###### 3 



Do not give your strength to women, Or your ways to that which destroys kings. 







###### 4 



It is not for kings, Lemuel, It is not for kings to drink wine, Or for rulers to desire intoxicating drink, 







###### 5 



Otherwise they will drink and forget what is decreed, And pervert the [^a]rights of all the [^b]needy. 







###### 6 



Give intoxicating drink to one who is perishing, And wine to one [^c]whose life is bitter. 







###### 7 



Let him drink and forget his poverty, And remember his trouble no more. 







###### 8 



Open your mouth for the people who cannot speak, For the [^d]rights of all the [^e]unfortunate. 







###### 9 



Open your mouth, judge righteously, And [^f]defend the rights of the poor and needy. ## Description of a Worthy Woman 







###### 10 



An excellent wife, who can find _her_? For her worth is far above jewels. 







###### 11 



The heart of her husband trusts in her, And he will have no lack of gain. 







###### 12 



She does him good and not evil All the days of her life. 







###### 13 



She looks for wool and linen, And works with her [^g]hands [^h]in delight. 







###### 14 



She is like merchant ships; She brings her food from afar. 







###### 15 



And she rises while it is still night And gives food to her household, And [^i]portions to her attendants. 







###### 16 



She considers a field and buys it; From [^j]her earnings she plants a vineyard. 







###### 17 



She surrounds her waist with strength And makes her arms strong. 







###### 18 



She senses that her profit is good; Her lamp does not go out at night. 







###### 19 



She stretches out her hands to the [^k]distaff, And her [^l]hands grasp the spindle. 







###### 20 



She [^m]extends her hand to the poor, And she stretches out her hands to the needy. 







###### 21 



She is not afraid of the snow for her household, For all her household are clothed with scarlet. 







###### 22 



She makes coverings for herself; Her clothing is fine linen and purple. 







###### 23 



Her husband is known in the gates, When he sits among the elders of the land. 







###### 24 



She makes linen garments and sells _them_, And [^n]supplies belts to the [^o]tradesmen. 







###### 25 



Strength and dignity are her clothing, And she smiles at the [^p]future. 







###### 26 



She opens her mouth in wisdom, And the [^q]teaching of kindness is on her tongue. 







###### 27 



She watches over the activities of her household, And does not eat the bread of idleness. 







###### 28 



Her children rise up and bless her; Her husband _also_, and he praises her, _saying_: 







###### 29 



"Many daughters have done nobly, But you excel them all." 







###### 30 



Charm is deceitful and beauty is vain, _But_ a woman who [^r]fears the LORD, she shall be praised. 







###### 31 



Give her the [^s]product of her hands, And let her works praise her in the gates. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

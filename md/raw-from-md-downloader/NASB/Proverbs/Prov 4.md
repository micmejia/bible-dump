# Proverbs 4

***








###### 1 



Listen, _my_ sons, to the instruction of a father, And pay attention so that you may [^a]gain understanding, 







###### 2 



For I give you good teaching; Do not abandon my [^b]instruction. 







###### 3 



When I was a son to my father, Tender and the only son in the sight of my mother, 







###### 4 



He taught me and said to me, "Let your heart take hold of my words; Keep my commandments and live; 







###### 5 



Acquire wisdom! Acquire understanding! Do not forget nor turn away from the words of my mouth. 







###### 6 



Do not abandon her, and she will guard you; Love her, and she will watch over you. 







###### 7 



The [^c]beginning of wisdom _is_: Acquire wisdom; And with all your possessions, acquire understanding. 







###### 8 



Prize her, and she will exalt you; She will honor you if you embrace her. 







###### 9 



She will place on your head a garland of grace; She will present you with a crown of beauty." 







###### 10 



Listen, my son, and accept my sayings, And the years of your life will be many. 







###### 11 



I have instructed you in the way of wisdom; I have led you in upright paths. 







###### 12 



When you walk, your steps will not be hampered; And if you run, you will not stumble. 







###### 13 



Take hold of instruction; do not let go. Guard her, for she is your life. 







###### 14 



Do not enter the path of the wicked And do not proceed in the way of evil people. 







###### 15 



Avoid it, do not pass by it; Turn away from it and pass on. 







###### 16 



For they cannot sleep unless they do evil; And [^d]they are robbed of sleep unless they make _someone_ stumble. 







###### 17 



For they eat the bread of wickedness, And drink the wine of violence. 







###### 18 



But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn That shines brighter and brighter until the full day. 







###### 19 



The way of the wicked is like darkness; They do not know over what they [^e]stumble. 







###### 20 



My son, pay attention to my words; Incline your ear to my sayings. 







###### 21 



They are not to escape from your sight; Keep them in the midst of your heart. 







###### 22 



For they are life to those who find them, And healing to all [^f]their body. 







###### 23 



Watch over your heart with all diligence, For from it _flow_ the springs of life. 







###### 24 



Rid yourself of a deceitful mouth And keep devious [^g]speech far from you. 







###### 25 



Let your eyes look directly ahead And let your [^h]gaze be fixed straight in front of you. 







###### 26 



[^i]Watch the path of your feet, And all your ways will be established. 







###### 27 



Do not turn to the right or to the left; Turn your foot from evil. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

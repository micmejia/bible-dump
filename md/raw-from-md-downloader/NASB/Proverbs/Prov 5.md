# Proverbs 5

***








###### 1 



My son, pay attention to my wisdom, Incline your ear to my understanding, 







###### 2 



So that you may maintain discretion And your lips may comply with knowledge. 







###### 3 



For the lips of an [^a]adulteress drip honey, And her [^b]speech is smoother than oil; 







###### 4 



But in the end she is bitter as wormwood, Sharp as a two-edged sword. 







###### 5 



Her feet go down to death, Her steps take hold of Sheol. 







###### 6 



[^c]She does not ponder the path of life; Her ways are unstable, she does not know _it_. 







###### 7 



Now then, _my_ sons, listen to me And do not turn away from the words of my mouth. 







###### 8 



Keep your way far from her, And do not go near the door of her house, 







###### 9 



Otherwise you will give your vigor to others, And your years to the cruel one; 







###### 10 



And strangers will be filled with your strength, And your hard-earned possessions _will go_ to the house of a foreigner; 







###### 11 



And you will groan [^d]in [^e]the end, When your flesh and your body are consumed; 







###### 12 



And you say, "How I hated instruction! And my heart disdainfully rejected rebuke! 







###### 13 



I did not listen to the voice of my teachers, Nor incline my ear to my instructors! 







###### 14 



I was almost in total ruin In the midst of the assembly and congregation." 







###### 15 



Drink water from your own cistern, And [^f]fresh water from your own well. 







###### 16 



Should your springs overflow into the street, Streams of water in the public squares? 







###### 17 



Let them be yours alone, And not for strangers with you. 







###### 18 



Let your fountain be blessed, And rejoice in the wife of your youth. 







###### 19 



_Like_ a loving doe and a graceful mountain goat, Let her breasts satisfy you at all times; Be [^g]exhilarated always with her love. 







###### 20 



For why should you, my son, be exhilarated with an [^h]adulteress, And embrace the breasts of a foreigner? 







###### 21 



For the ways of everyone are before the eyes of the LORD, And He observes all his paths. 







###### 22 



His own wrongdoings will trap the wicked, And he will be held by the ropes of his sin. 







###### 23 



He will die for lack of instruction, And in the greatness of his foolishness he will go astray. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

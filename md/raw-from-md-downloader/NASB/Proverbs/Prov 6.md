# Proverbs 6

***








###### 1 



My son, if you have become a guarantor for your neighbor, _Or_ have given a handshake for a stranger, 







###### 2 



_If_ you have been ensnared by the words of your mouth, _Or_ caught by the words of your mouth, 







###### 3 



Then do this, my son, and save yourself: Since you have come into the [^a]hand of your neighbor, Go, humble yourself, and be urgent with your neighbor _to free yourself_. 







###### 4 



Give no sleep to your eyes, Nor slumber to your eyelids; 







###### 5 



Save yourself like a gazelle from _the hunter's_ hand, And like a bird from the hand of the fowler. 







###### 6 



Go to the ant, you [^b]lazy one, Observe its ways and be wise, 







###### 7 



Which, having no chief, Officer, or ruler, 







###### 8 



Prepares its food in the summer _And_ gathers its provision in the harvest. 







###### 9 



How long will you lie down, you [^c]lazy one? When will you arise from your sleep? 







###### 10 



"A little sleep, a little slumber, A little folding of the hands to [^d]rest," 







###### 11 



Then your poverty will come in like a [^e]drifter, And your need like [^f]an armed man. 







###### 12 



A worthless person, a wicked man, Is one who walks with a perverse mouth, 







###### 13 



Who winks with his eyes, who [^g]signals with his feet, Who [^h]points with his fingers; 







###### 14 



Who, _with_ perversion in his heart, continually devises evil, Who [^i]spreads strife. 







###### 15 



Therefore his disaster will come suddenly; Instantly he will be broken and there will be no healing. 







###### 16 



There are six things that the LORD hates, Seven that are an abomination [^j]to Him: 







###### 17 



Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, And hands that shed innocent blood, 







###### 18 



A heart that devises wicked plans, Feet that run rapidly to evil, 







###### 19 



A false witness _who_ declares lies, And one who [^k]spreads strife among brothers. 







###### 20 



My son, comply with the commandment of your father, And do not ignore the [^l]teaching of your mother; 







###### 21 



Bind them continually on your heart; Tie them around your neck. 







###### 22 



When you walk, [^m]they will guide you; When you sleep, [^n]they will watch over you; And when you awake, [^o]they will talk to you. 







###### 23 



For the commandment is a lamp and the [^p]teaching is light; And rebukes for discipline are the way of life 







###### 24 



To keep you from the evil woman, From the smooth tongue of the foreign woman. 







###### 25 



Do not desire her beauty in your heart, Nor let her capture you with her eyelids. 







###### 26 



For the price of a prostitute _reduces one_ to a loaf of bread, And [^q]an adulteress hunts for a precious life. 







###### 27 



Can anyone take fire in his lap And his clothes not be burned? 







###### 28 



Or can a person walk on hot coals And his feet not be scorched? 







###### 29 



So is the one who goes in to his neighbor's wife; Whoever touches her will not [^r]go unpunished. 







###### 30 



_People_ do not despise a thief if he steals To satisfy [^s]himself when he is hungry; 







###### 31 



But when he is found, he must repay seven times _as much_; He must give up all the property of his house. 







###### 32 



One who commits adultery with a woman is lacking [^t]sense; He who would destroy [^u]himself commits it. 







###### 33 



He will find wounds and disgrace, And his shame will not be removed. 







###### 34 



For jealousy [^v]enrages a man, And he will not have compassion on the day of vengeance. 







###### 35 



He will not [^w]accept any settlement, Nor will he be [^x]satisfied though you make _it_ a large gift. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Proverbs 7

***








###### 1 



My son, keep my words And treasure my commandments within you. 







###### 2 



Keep my commandments and live, And my [^a]teaching as the [^b]apple of your eye. 







###### 3 



Bind them on your fingers; Write them on the tablet of your heart. 







###### 4 



Say to wisdom, "You are my sister," And call understanding _your_ intimate friend, 







###### 5 



So that they may keep you from an [^c]adulteress, From the foreigner who flatters with her words. 







###### 6 



For at the window of my house I looked out through my lattice, 







###### 7 



And I saw among the naive, _And_ discerned among the [^d]youths A young man lacking [^e]sense, 







###### 8 



Passing through the street near her corner; And he walks along the way to her house, 







###### 9 



In the twilight, in the [^f]evening, In the [^g]middle of the night and the darkness. 







###### 10 



And behold, a woman _comes_ to meet him, Dressed as a prostitute and cunning of heart. 







###### 11 



She is boisterous and rebellious, Her feet do not remain at home; 







###### 12 



_She is_ now in the streets, now in the public squares, And lurks by every corner. 







###### 13 



So she seizes him and kisses him, [^h]And with a brazen face she says to him: 







###### 14 



"[^i]I was due to offer peace offerings; Today I have paid my vows. 







###### 15 



Therefore I have come out to meet you, To seek your presence diligently, and I have found you. 







###### 16 



I have spread my couch with coverings, With colored linens of Egypt. 







###### 17 



I have sprinkled my bed With myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 







###### 18 



Come, let's drink our fill of love until morning; Let's delight ourselves with caresses. 







###### 19 



For [^j]my husband is not at home; He has gone on a long journey. 







###### 20 



He has taken a bag of money [^k]with him. At the full moon he will come home." 







###### 21 



With her many persuasions she entices him; With her [^l]flattering lips she seduces him. 







###### 22 



Suddenly he follows her As an ox goes to the slaughter, Or as [^m]_one_ walks in ankle bracelets to the discipline of a fool, 







###### 23 



Until an arrow pierces through his liver; As a bird hurries to the snare, So he does not know that it _will cost him_ his life. 







###### 24 



Now therefore, _my_ sons, listen to me, And pay attention to the words of my mouth. 







###### 25 



Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways, Do not stray into her paths. 







###### 26 



For many are the [^n]victims she has brought to ruin, And numerous are all those slaughtered by her. 







###### 27 



Her house is the way to Sheol, Descending to the chambers of death. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

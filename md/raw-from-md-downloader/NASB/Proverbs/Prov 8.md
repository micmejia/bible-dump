# Proverbs 8

***








###### 1 



Does not wisdom call, And understanding [^a]raise her voice? 







###### 2 



On top of the heights beside the way, Where the paths meet, she takes her stand; 







###### 3 



Beside the gates, at the opening to the city, At the entrance of the doors, she cries out: 







###### 4 



"To you, people, I call, And my voice is to [^b]mankind. 







###### 5 



You naive ones, understand prudence; And, you fools, understand [^c]wisdom! 







###### 6 



Listen, for I will speak noble things; And the opening of my lips _will reveal_ right things. 







###### 7 



For my mouth will proclaim truth; And wickedness is an abomination to my lips. 







###### 8 



All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; There is nothing crooked or perverted in them. 







###### 9 



They are all straightforward to him who understands, And right to those who find knowledge. 







###### 10 



Accept my instruction and not silver, And knowledge rather than choice gold. 







###### 11 



For wisdom is better than [^d]jewels; And all desirable things cannot compare with her. 







###### 12 



"I, wisdom, dwell with prudence, And I find knowledge _and_ discretion. 







###### 13 



The fear of the LORD is to hate evil; Pride, arrogance, the evil way, And the perverted mouth, I hate. 







###### 14 



Advice is mine and sound wisdom; I am understanding, power is mine. 







###### 15 



By me kings reign, And rulers decree justice. 







###### 16 



By me princes rule, and nobles, All who judge rightly. 







###### 17 



I love those who love me; And those who diligently seek me will find me. 







###### 18 



Riches and honor are with me, Enduring wealth and righteousness. 







###### 19 



My fruit is better than gold, even pure gold; And my yield _better_ than choice silver. 







###### 20 



I walk in the way of righteousness, In the midst of the paths of justice, 







###### 21 



To endow those who love me with wealth, That I may fill their treasuries. 







###### 22 



"The LORD [^e]created me at the beginning of His way, Before His works [^f]of old. 







###### 23 



From eternity I was [^g]established, From the beginning, from the earliest times of the earth. 







###### 24 



When there were no ocean depths, I was born, When there were no springs abounding with water. 







###### 25 



Before the mountains were settled, Before the hills, I was born; 







###### 26 



While He had not yet made the earth and the [^h]fields, Nor the first dust of the world. 







###### 27 



When He established the heavens, I was there; When He inscribed a circle on the face of the deep, 







###### 28 



When He made firm the skies above, When the springs of the deep became [^i]fixed, 







###### 29 



When He set a boundary for the sea So that the water would not violate His [^j]command, When He marked out the foundations of the earth; 







###### 30 



Then I was beside Him, _as_ a master workman; And I was _His_ delight daily, [^k]Rejoicing always before Him, 







###### 31 



[^l]Rejoicing in the world, His earth, And _having_ my delight in the sons of mankind. 







###### 32 



"Now then, sons, listen to me, For blessed are those who keep my ways. 







###### 33 



Listen to instruction and be wise, And do not neglect _it_. 







###### 34 



Blessed is the person who listens to me, Watching daily at my gates, Waiting at my doorposts. 







###### 35 



For one who finds me finds life, And obtains favor from the LORD. 







###### 36 



But one who [^m]sins against me injures himself; All those who hate me love death." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

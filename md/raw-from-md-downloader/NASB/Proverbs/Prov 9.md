# Proverbs 9

***








###### 1 



Wisdom has built her house, She has carved out her seven pillars; 







###### 2 



She has [^a]prepared her food, she has mixed her wine; She has also set her table; 







###### 3 



She has sent out her attendants, she calls out From the tops of the heights of the city: 







###### 4 



"Whoever is naive, let him turn in here!" To him who lacks [^b]understanding she says, 







###### 5 



"Come, eat of my food And drink of the wine I have mixed. 







###### 6 



[^c]Abandon _your_ foolishness and live, And proceed in the way of understanding." 







###### 7 



One who corrects a scoffer gets dishonor for himself, And one who rebukes a wicked person _gets_ [^d]insults for himself. 







###### 8 



Do not rebuke a scoffer, or he will hate you; Rebuke a wise person and he will love you. 







###### 9 



Give _instruction_ to a wise person and he will become still wiser; Teach a righteous person and he will increase _his_ insight. 







###### 10 



The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, And the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding. 







###### 11 



For by me your days will be multiplied, And years of life will be added to you. 







###### 12 



If you are wise, you are wise for yourself, And if you scoff, you alone will [^e]suffer _from it_. 







###### 13 



[^f]A woman of foolishness is boisterous, _She has_ a lack of understanding and knows nothing. 







###### 14 



She sits at the doorway of her house, On a seat by the high places of the city, 







###### 15 



Calling to those who pass by, Who are going straight on their paths: 







###### 16 



"Whoever is naive, let him turn in here," And to him who lacks [^g]understanding she says, 







###### 17 



"Stolen water is sweet; And bread _eaten_ in secret is pleasant." 







###### 18 



But he does not know that the [^h]dead are there, _That_ her guests are in the depths of Sheol. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

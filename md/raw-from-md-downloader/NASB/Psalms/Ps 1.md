# Psalms 1

***








###### 1 



Blessed is the person who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked, Nor stand in the [^a]path of sinners, Nor sit in the seat of scoffers! 







###### 2 



But his delight is in the Law of the LORD, And on His Law he meditates day and night. 







###### 3 



He will be like a tree planted by [^b]streams of water, Which yields its fruit in its season, And its [^c]leaf does not wither; And [^d]in whatever he does, he prospers. 







###### 4 



The wicked are not so, But they are like chaff which the wind blows away. 







###### 5 



Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, Nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous. 







###### 6 



For the LORD [^e]knows the way of the righteous, But the way of the wicked will perish. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

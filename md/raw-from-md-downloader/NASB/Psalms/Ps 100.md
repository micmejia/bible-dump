# Psalms 100

***








###### 1 



Shout joyfully to the LORD, all the earth. 







###### 2 



Serve the LORD with jubilation; Come before Him with rejoicing. 







###### 3 



Know that the LORD [^b]Himself is God; It is He who has made us, and [^c]not we ourselves; _We are_ His people and the sheep of His pasture. 







###### 4 



Enter His gates with [^d]thanksgiving, _And_ His courtyards with praise. Give thanks to Him, bless His name. 







###### 5 



For the LORD is good; His mercy is everlasting And His faithfulness is to all generations. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

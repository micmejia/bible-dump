# Psalms 110

***








###### 1 



The LORD says to my Lord: "Sit at My right hand Until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet." 







###### 2 



The LORD will stretch out Your strong scepter from Zion, _saying_, "Rule in the midst of Your enemies." 







###### 3 



Your people [^a]will volunteer freely on the day of Your [^b]power; In [^c]holy splendor, from the womb of the dawn, [^d]Your youth are to You _as_ the dew. 







###### 4 



The LORD has sworn and will not [^e]change His mind, "You are a priest forever According to the order of Melchizedek." 







###### 5 



The Lord is at Your right hand; He [^f]will shatter kings in the day of His wrath. 







###### 6 



He will judge among the nations, He [^g]will fill _them_ with corpses, He [^h]will shatter the [^i]chief men over a broad country. 







###### 7 



He will drink from the brook by the wayside; Therefore He will lift up _His_ head. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

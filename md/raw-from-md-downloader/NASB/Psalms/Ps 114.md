# Psalms 114

***








###### 1 



When Israel went forth from Egypt, The house of Jacob from a people of a foreign language, 







###### 2 



Judah became His sanctuary; Israel, His dominion. 







###### 3 



The sea looked and fled; The Jordan turned back. 







###### 4 



The mountains skipped like rams, The hills, like lambs. 







###### 5 



What ails you, sea, that you flee? Jordan, that you turn back? 







###### 6 



Mountains, that you skip like rams? Hills, like lambs? 







###### 7 



Tremble, earth, before the Lord, Before the God of Jacob, 







###### 8 



Who turned the rock into a pool of water, The flint into a fountain of water. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

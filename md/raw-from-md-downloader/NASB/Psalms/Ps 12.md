# Psalms 12

***








###### 1 



Help, LORD, for the godly person has come to an end, For the faithful have disappeared from the sons of mankind. 







###### 2 



They speak [^b]lies to one another; They speak with [^c]flattering lips and a double heart. 







###### 3 



May the LORD cut off all [^d]flattering lips, The tongue that speaks great things; 







###### 4 



Who have said, "With our tongue we will prevail; Our lips are [^e]our own; who is lord over us?" 







###### 5 



"Because of the devastation of the poor, because of the groaning of the needy, Now I will arise," says the LORD; "I will put him in the safety for which he longs." 







###### 6 



The words of the LORD are pure words; Like silver refined in a furnace on the ground, filtered seven times. 







###### 7 



You, LORD, will keep them; You will protect him from this generation forever. 







###### 8 



The wicked strut about on every side When [^f]vileness is exalted among the sons of mankind. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

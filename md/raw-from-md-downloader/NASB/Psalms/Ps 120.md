# Psalms 120

***








###### 1 



I cried to the LORD in my trouble, And He answered me. 







###### 2 



Rescue my soul, LORD, from lying lips, From a deceitful tongue. 







###### 3 



What will _He_ give to you, and what more will _He_ do to you, You deceitful tongue? 







###### 4 



Sharp arrows of the warrior, With the _burning_ coals of the broom tree! 







###### 5 



Woe to me, for I reside in Meshech, For I have settled among the tents of Kedar! 







###### 6 



Too long has my soul had its dwelling With those who hate peace. 







###### 7 



I am _for_ peace, but when I speak, They are for war. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

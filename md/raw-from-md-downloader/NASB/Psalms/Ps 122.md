# Psalms 122

***








###### 1 



I was glad when they said to me, "Let's go to the house of the LORD." 







###### 2 



Our feet are standing Within your gates, Jerusalem, 







###### 3 



Jerusalem, that has been built As a city that is firmly joined together; 







###### 4 



To which the tribes go up, the tribes of [^a]the LORD-- [^b]An ordinance for Israel-- To give thanks to the name of the LORD. 







###### 5 



For thrones were set there for judgment, The thrones of the house of David. 







###### 6 



Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: "May they prosper who love you. 







###### 7 



May peace be within your walls, And prosperity within your palaces." 







###### 8 



For the sake of my brothers and my friends, I will now say, "May peace be within you." 







###### 9 



For the sake of the house of the LORD our God, I will seek your good. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

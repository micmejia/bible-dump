# Psalms 123

***








###### 1 



To You I have raised my eyes, You who are enthroned in the heavens! 







###### 2 



Behold, as the eyes of servants _look_ to the hand of their master, As the eyes of a female servant to the hand of her mistress, So our eyes _look_ to the LORD our God, Until He is gracious to us. 







###### 3 



Be gracious to us, LORD, be gracious to us, For we have had much more than enough of contempt. 







###### 4 



Our soul has had much more than enough Of the scoffing of those who are at ease, _And_ with the contempt of the proud. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

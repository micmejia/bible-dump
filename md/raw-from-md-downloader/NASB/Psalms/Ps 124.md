# Psalms 124

***








###### 1 



"Had it not been the LORD who was on our side," Let Israel say, 







###### 2 



"Had it not been the LORD who was on our side When people rose up against us, 







###### 3 



Then they would have swallowed us alive, When their anger was kindled against us; 







###### 4 



Then the waters would have flooded over us, The stream would have [^a]swept over our souls; 







###### 5 



Then the raging waters would have [^b]swept over our souls." 







###### 6 



Blessed be the LORD, Who has not given us [^c]to be torn by their teeth. 







###### 7 



Our souls have escaped like a bird from the trapper's snare; The snare is broken and we have escaped. 







###### 8

# Psalms 125

***








###### 1 



Those who trust in the LORD Are like Mount Zion, _which_ cannot be moved _but_ remains forever. 







###### 2 



_As_ the mountains surround Jerusalem, So the LORD surrounds His people From this time and forever. 







###### 3 



For the scepter of wickedness will not rest upon the [^a]land of the righteous, So that the righteous will not extend their hands to do wrong. 







###### 4 



Do good, LORD, to those who are good And to those who are upright in their hearts. 







###### 5 



But as for those who turn aside to their crooked ways, The LORD will lead them away with those who practice injustice. Peace be upon Israel. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

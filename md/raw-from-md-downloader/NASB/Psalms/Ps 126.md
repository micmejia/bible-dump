# Psalms 126

***








###### 1 



When the LORD brought back [^a]the captives of Zion, We were like those who dream. 







###### 2 



Then our mouth was filled with laughter And our tongue with joyful shouting; Then they said among the nations, "The LORD has done great things for them." 







###### 3 



The LORD has done great things for us; We are joyful. 







###### 4 



Restore our fortunes, LORD, As the [^b]streams in the [^c]South. 







###### 5 



Those who sow in tears shall harvest with joyful shouting. 







###### 6 



One who goes here and there weeping, carrying _his_ bag of seed, Shall indeed come again with a shout of joy, bringing his sheaves _with him_. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

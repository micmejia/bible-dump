# Psalms 127

***








###### 1 



Unless the LORD builds a house, They who build it labor in vain; Unless the LORD guards a city, The watchman stays awake in vain. 







###### 2 



It is futile for you to rise up early, To [^a]stay up late, To eat the bread of painful labor; This is how He gives to His beloved sleep. 







###### 3 



Behold, children are a [^b]gift of the LORD, The fruit of the womb is a reward. 







###### 4 



Like arrows in the hand of a warrior, So are the children of one's youth. 







###### 5 



Blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them; They will not be ashamed When they speak with their enemies in the gate. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

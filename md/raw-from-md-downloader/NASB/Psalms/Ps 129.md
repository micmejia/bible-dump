# Psalms 129

***








###### 1 



"[^a]Many times they have attacked me from my youth up," Let Israel say, 







###### 2 



"[^b]Many times they have attacked me from my youth up; Yet they have not prevailed against me. 







###### 3 



The plowers plowed upon my back; They lengthened their furrows." 







###### 4 



The LORD is righteous; He has cut up the ropes of the wicked. 







###### 5 



May all who hate Zion Be put to shame and turned backward; 







###### 6 



May they be like grass upon the housetops, Which withers before it [^c]grows up; 







###### 7 



With which the harvester does not fill his [^d]hand, Or the binder of sheaves his [^e]arms; 







###### 8 



Nor do those who pass by say, "The blessing of the LORD be upon you; We bless you in the name of the LORD." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

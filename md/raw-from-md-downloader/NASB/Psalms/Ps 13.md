# Psalms 13

***








###### 1 



How long, LORD? Will You forget me forever? How long will You hide Your face from me? 







###### 2 



How long am I to feel anxious in my soul, _With_ grief in my heart all the day? How long will my enemy be exalted over me? 







###### 3 



Consider _and_ answer me, O LORD my God; Enlighten my eyes, or I will sleep the _sleep of_ death, 







###### 4 



And my enemy will say, "I have overcome him," _And_ my adversaries will rejoice when I am shaken. 







###### 5 



But I have trusted in Your faithfulness; My heart shall rejoice in Your salvation. 







###### 6 



I will sing to the LORD, Because He has looked after me. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

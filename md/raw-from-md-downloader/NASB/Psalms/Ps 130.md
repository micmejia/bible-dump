# Psalms 130

***








###### 1 



Out of the depths I have cried to You, LORD. 







###### 2 



Lord, hear my voice! Let Your ears be attentive To the sound of my pleadings. 







###### 3 



If You, [^a]LORD, were to keep _account of_ guilty deeds, Lord, who could stand? 







###### 4 



But there is forgiveness with You, So that You may be [^b]revered. 







###### 5 



I wait for the LORD, my soul waits, And I [^c]wait for His word. 







###### 6 



My soul _waits in hope_ for the Lord More than the watchmen for the morning; _Yes, more than_ the watchmen for the morning. 







###### 7 



Israel, wait for the LORD; For with the LORD there is mercy, And with Him is abundant redemption. 







###### 8 



And He will redeem Israel From all his guilty deeds. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

***








###### 1 



LORD, my heart is not proud, nor my eyes arrogant; Nor do I [^a]involve myself in great matters, Or in things too [^b]difficult for me. 







###### 2

###### 3 



Israel, wait for the LORD From this time _on_ and forever. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

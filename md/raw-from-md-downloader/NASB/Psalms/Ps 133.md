# Psalms 133

***








###### 1 



Behold, how good and how pleasant it is For brothers to live together in unity! 







###### 2 



It is like the precious oil on the head, Running down upon the beard, _As on_ Aaron's beard, _The oil_ which ran down upon the edge of his robes. 







###### 3 



It is like the dew of Hermon Coming down upon the mountains of Zion; For the LORD commanded the blessing there--life forever. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

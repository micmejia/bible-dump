# Psalms 15

***








###### 1 



LORD, who may reside in Your tent? Who may settle on Your holy hill? 







###### 2 



One who walks with integrity, practices righteousness, And speaks truth in his heart. 







###### 3 



He does not slander [^a]with his tongue, Nor do evil to his neighbor, Nor bring shame on his friend; 







###### 4 



A despicable person is despised in his eyes, But he honors those who fear the LORD; He takes an oath to his own detriment, and does not change; 







###### 5 



He does not [^b]lend his money [^c]at interest, Nor does he take a bribe against the innocent. One who does these things will never be shaken. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

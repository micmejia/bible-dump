# Psalms 2

***








###### 1 



Why are the [^a]nations restless And the peoples plotting in vain? 







###### 2 



The kings of the earth take their stand And the rulers conspire together Against the LORD and against His [^b]Anointed, _saying_, 







###### 3 



"Let's tear their shackles apart And throw their ropes away from us!" 







###### 4 



He who [^c]sits in the heavens laughs, The Lord scoffs at them. 







###### 5 



Then He will speak to them in His anger And terrify them in His fury, _saying_, 







###### 6 



"But as for Me, I have installed My King Upon Zion, My holy mountain." 







###### 7 



"I will announce the [^d]decree of the LORD: He said to Me, 'You are My Son, Today I have fathered You. 







###### 8 



Ask _it_ of Me, and I will certainly give the [^e]nations as Your inheritance, And the ends of the earth as Your possession. 







###### 9 



You shall [^f]break them with a [^g]rod of iron, You shall shatter them like [^h]earthenware.'" 







###### 10 



Now then, you kings, use insight; Let yourselves be instructed, you [^i]judges of the earth. 







###### 11 



Serve the LORD with [^j]reverence And rejoice with trembling. 







###### 12 



[^k]Kiss the Son, that He not be angry and you perish _on_ the way, For His wrath may be kindled quickly.

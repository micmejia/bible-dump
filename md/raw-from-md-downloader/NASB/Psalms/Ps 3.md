# Psalms 3

***








###### 1 



LORD, how my enemies have increased! Many are rising up against me. 







###### 2 



Many are saying of my soul, "There is no salvation for him in God." Selah 







###### 3 



But You, LORD, are a shield around me, My glory, and the One who lifts my head. 







###### 4 



I was crying out to the LORD with my voice, And He answered me from His holy [^b]mountain. Selah 







###### 5 



[^c]I lay down and slept; I awoke, for the LORD sustains me. 







###### 6 



I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people Who have set themselves against me all around. 







###### 7 



Arise, LORD; save me, my God! For You [^d]have struck all my enemies on the [^e]cheek; You [^f]have shattered the teeth of the wicked. 







###### 8 



[^g]Salvation belongs to the LORD; _May_ Your blessing [^h]_be_ upon Your people!

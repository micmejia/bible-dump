# Psalms 4

***








###### 1 



Answer me when I call, God [^b]of my righteousness! You have [^c]relieved me in my distress; Be gracious to me and hear my prayer. 







###### 2 



You sons of man, how long will my [^d]honor be _treated as_ an insult? _How long_ will you love what is worthless and strive for a lie? Selah 







###### 3 



But know that the LORD has [^e]set apart the godly person for Himself; The LORD hears when I call to Him. 







###### 4 



[^f]Tremble, [^g]and do not sin; [^h]Meditate in your heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah 







###### 5 



Offer [^i]the sacrifices of righteousness, And trust in the LORD. 







###### 6 



Many are saying, "Who will show us _anything_ good?" Lift up the light of Your face upon us, LORD! 







###### 7 



You have put joy in my heart, More than when their grain and new wine are abundant. 







###### 8 



In peace I will [^j]both lie down and sleep, For You alone, LORD, have me dwell in safety. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

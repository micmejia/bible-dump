# Psalms 5

***








###### 1 



Listen to my words, LORD, Consider my sighing. 







###### 2 



Listen to the sound of my cry for help, my King and my God, For to You I pray. 







###### 3 



In the morning, LORD, [^b]You will hear my voice; In the morning I will present _my_ [^c]_prayer_ to You and be on the watch. 







###### 4 



For You are not a God who takes pleasure in wickedness; No evil can dwell with You. 







###### 5 



The boastful will not stand before Your eyes; You hate all who do injustice. 







###### 6 



You destroy those who speak lies; The LORD loathes the person of bloodshed and deceit. 







###### 7 



But as for me, by Your abundant graciousness I will enter Your house, [^d]At Your holy temple I will bow in reverence for You. 







###### 8 



LORD, lead me in Your righteousness because of my enemies; Make Your way [^e]straight before me. 







###### 9 



For there is nothing [^f]trustworthy in [^g]their mouth; Their inward part is destruction _itself_. Their throat is an open grave; They [^h]flatter with their tongue. 







###### 10 



Make them pay, God; Have them fall by their own schemes! Scatter them in the multitude of their wrongdoings, For they are rebellious against You. 







###### 11 



But rejoice, all who take refuge in You, Sing for joy forever! And [^i]may You shelter them, That those who love Your name may rejoice in You. 







###### 12 



For You bless the righteous person, LORD, You surround him with favor as with a shield. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Psalms 56

***








###### 1 



Be gracious to me, God, for a man has [^d]trampled upon me; [^e]Fighting all day long he oppresses me. 







###### 2 



My enemies have trampled upon me all day long, For [^f]they are many who fight proudly against me. 







###### 3 



[^g]When I am afraid, [^h]I will put my trust in You. 







###### 4 



In God, whose word I praise, In God I have put my trust; I shall not be afraid. What can _mere_ [^i]mortals do to me? 







###### 5 



All day long they distort my words; All their [^j]thoughts are against me for evil. 







###### 6 



They [^k]attack, they lurk, They watch my [^l]steps, As they have waited _to take_ my [^m]life. 







###### 7 



Because of _their_ wickedness, _will there be_ an escape for them? In anger make the peoples fall down, God! 







###### 8 



You have taken account of my [^n]miseries; Put my tears in Your bottle. _Are they_ not in Your book? 







###### 9 



Then my enemies will turn back on the day when I call; This I know, [^o]that God is for me. 







###### 10 



In God, _whose_ word I praise, In the LORD, _whose_ word I praise, 







###### 11 



In God I have put my [^p]trust, I shall not be afraid. What can mankind do to me? 







###### 12 



Your vows are _binding_ upon me, God; I will render thanksgiving offerings to You. 







###### 13 



For You have saved my soul from death, [^q]Indeed my feet from stumbling, So that I may walk before God In the light of the [^r]living. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

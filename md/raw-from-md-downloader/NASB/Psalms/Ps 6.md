# Psalms 6

***








###### 1 



LORD, do not rebuke me in Your anger, Nor discipline me in Your wrath. 







###### 2 



Be gracious to me, LORD, for I _am_ frail; Heal me, LORD, for my bones are horrified. 







###### 3 



And my soul is greatly horrified; But You, LORD--how long? 







###### 4 



Return, LORD, rescue my [^b]soul; Save me because of Your mercy. 







###### 5 



For there is no [^c]mention of You in death; In [^d]Sheol, who will praise You? 







###### 6 



I am weary with my sighing; Every night I make my bed swim, I flood my couch with my tears. 







###### 7 



My eye has wasted away with grief; It has grown old because of all my enemies. 







###### 8 



Leave me, all you who practice injustice, For the LORD has heard the sound of my weeping. 







###### 9 



The LORD has heard my pleading, The LORD receives my prayer. 







###### 10 



All my enemies will be put to shame and greatly horrified; They shall [^e]turn back, they will suddenly be put to shame. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

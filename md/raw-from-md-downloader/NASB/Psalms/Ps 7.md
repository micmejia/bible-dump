# Psalms 7

***








###### 1 



O LORD my God, in You I have taken refuge; Save me from all those who pursue me, and rescue me, 







###### 2 



Or he will tear [^c]my soul like a lion, Dragging me away, while there is no one to rescue _me_. 







###### 3 



O LORD my God, if I have done this, If there is injustice in my hands, 







###### 4 



If I have done evil to [^d]my friend, Or have plundered [^e]my enemy for no reason, 







###### 5 



Let the enemy pursue [^f]my soul and overtake [^g]_it_; And let him trample my life to the ground And lay my glory in the dust. Selah 







###### 6 



Arise, LORD, in Your anger; Raise Yourself against the rage of my enemies, And stir Yourself [^h]for me; You have ordered judgment. 







###### 7 



Let the assembly of the peoples encompass You, And return on high over it. 







###### 8 



The LORD judges the peoples; [^i]Vindicate me, LORD, according to my righteousness and my integrity that is in me. 







###### 9 



Please let the evil of the wicked come to an end, but establish the righteous; For the righteous God puts hearts and [^j]minds to the test. 







###### 10 



My shield is [^k]with God, Who saves the upright in heart. 







###### 11 



God is a righteous judge, And a God who shows indignation every day. 







###### 12 



If one does not repent, He will sharpen His sword; He has bent His bow and taken aim. 







###### 13 



He has also prepared deadly weapons for Himself; He makes His arrows fiery _shafts_. 







###### 14 



Behold, _an evil person_ is pregnant with injustice, And he conceives harm and gives birth to lies. 







###### 15 



He has dug a pit and hollowed it out, And has fallen into the hole which he made. 







###### 16 



His harm will return on his own head, And his violence will descend on the top of his own head. 







###### 17 



I will give thanks to the LORD according to His righteousness And will sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

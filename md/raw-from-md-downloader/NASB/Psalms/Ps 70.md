# Psalms 70

***








###### 1 



God, _hurry_ to save me; LORD, hurry to help me! 







###### 2 



May those who seek my [^a]life Be put to shame and humiliated; May those who delight [^b]in my harm Be turned back and dishonored. 







###### 3 



May those who say, "Aha, aha!" be [^c]turned back Because of their shame. 







###### 4 



May all who seek You rejoice and be glad in You; And may those who love Your salvation say continually, "May God be exalted!" 







###### 5 



But I am afflicted and needy; Hurry to me, God! You are my help and my savior; LORD, do not delay. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Psalms 8

***








###### 1 



LORD, our Lord, How majestic is Your name in all the earth, You who have [^a]displayed Your splendor above the heavens! 







###### 2 



From the mouths of infants and nursing babies You have established [^b]strength Because of Your enemies, To do away with the enemy and the revengeful. 







###### 3 



When I [^c]consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, The moon and the stars, which You have set in place; 







###### 4 



What is man that You think of him, And a son of man that You are concerned about him? 







###### 5 



Yet You have made him a little lower than [^d]God, And You crown him with glory and majesty! 







###### 6 



You have him rule over the works of Your hands; You have put everything under his feet, 







###### 7 



All sheep and oxen, And also the animals of the field, 







###### 8 



The birds of the sky, and the fish of the sea, Whatever passes through the paths of the seas. 







###### 9

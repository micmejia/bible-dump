# Psalms 82

***








###### 1 



God takes His position in [^a]His assembly; He judges in the midst of the gods. 







###### 2 



How long will you judge unjustly And show partiality to the wicked? Selah 







###### 3 



Vindicate the weak and fatherless; Do justice to the afflicted and destitute. 







###### 4 



Rescue the weak and needy; Save _them_ from the hand of the wicked. 







###### 5 



They do not know nor do they understand; They walk around in darkness; All the foundations of the earth are shaken. 







###### 6 



[^b]I said, "You are gods, And all of you are sons of the Most High. 







###### 7 



Nevertheless you will die like men, And fall like one of the princes." 







###### 8

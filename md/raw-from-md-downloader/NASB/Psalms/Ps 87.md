# Psalms 87

***








###### 1 



His foundation is in the holy mountains. 







###### 2 



The LORD loves the gates of Zion More than all the _other_ dwelling places of Jacob. 







###### 3 



Glorious things are spoken of you, City of God. Selah 







###### 4 



"I shall mention [^a]Rahab and Babylon [^b]among those who know Me; Behold, Philistia and Tyre with [^c]Cush: 'This one was born there.'" 







###### 5 



But of Zion it will be said, "This one and that one were born in her"; And the Most High Himself will establish her. 







###### 6 



The LORD will count when He registers the peoples, "This one was born there." Selah 







###### 7 



Then those who sing as _well as_ those who [^d]play the flutes _will say_, "All my springs _of joy_ are in you." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

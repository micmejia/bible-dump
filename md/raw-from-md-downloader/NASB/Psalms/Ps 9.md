# Psalms 9

***








###### 1 



I will give thanks to the LORD with all my heart; I will tell of all Your [^b]wonders. 







###### 2 



I will rejoice and be jubilant in You; I will sing praise to Your name, O Most High. 







###### 3 



When my enemies turn back, They stumble and perish before You. 







###### 4 



For You have maintained [^c]my just cause; You have sat on the throne [^d]judging righteously. 







###### 5 



You have rebuked the nations, You have eliminated the wicked; You have wiped out their name forever and ever. 







###### 6 



[^e]The enemy has come to an end _in_ everlasting ruins, And You have uprooted the cities; The very memory of them has perished. 







###### 7 



But the LORD [^f]sits _as King_ forever; He has established His throne for judgment, 







###### 8 



And He will judge the world in righteousness; He will execute judgment for the peoples fairly. 







###### 9 



[^g]The LORD will also be a stronghold for the oppressed, A stronghold in times of trouble; 







###### 10 



And [^h]those who know Your name will put their trust in You, For You, LORD, have not abandoned those who seek You. 







###### 11 



Sing praises to the LORD, who dwells in Zion; Declare His deeds among the peoples. 







###### 12 



For He who [^i]requires blood remembers them; He does not forget the cry of the needy. 







###### 13 



Be gracious to me, LORD; See my oppression from those who hate me, You who lift me up from the gates of death, 







###### 14 



So that I may tell of all Your praises, That in the gates of the daughter of Zion I may rejoice in Your [^j]salvation. 







###### 15 



The nations have sunk down into the pit _which_ they have made; In the net which they hid, their own foot has been caught. 







###### 16 



The LORD has made Himself known; He has executed judgment. A wicked one is ensnared in the work of his own hands. [^k]Higgaion Selah 







###### 17 



The wicked will [^l]return to [^m]Sheol, All the nations who forget God. 







###### 18 



For the needy will not always be forgotten, Nor the hope of the afflicted perish forever. 







###### 19 



Arise, LORD, do not let mankind prevail; Let the nations be judged before You. 







###### 20 



Put them in fear, LORD; Let the nations know that they are _merely_ human.

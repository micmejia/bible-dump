# Psalms 93

***








###### 1 



The LORD [^a]reigns, He is clothed with majesty; The LORD has clothed and encircled Himself with strength. Indeed, the world is _firmly_ established; it will not be moved. 







###### 2 



Your throne is established from of old; You are from eternity. 







###### 3 



The floods have lifted up, LORD, The floods have lifted up their voice, The floods lift up their pounding waves. 







###### 4 



More than the sounds of many waters, _Than_ the mighty breakers of the sea, The LORD on high is mighty. 







###### 5 



Your testimonies are fully confirmed; Holiness is pleasing to Your house, LORD, [^b]forevermore. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

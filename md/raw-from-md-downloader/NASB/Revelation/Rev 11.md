# Revelation 11

***








###### 1 



Then there was given to me a [^a]measuring rod like a staff; [^b]and someone said, "Get up and measure the [^c]temple of God and the altar, and those who worship in it. 







###### 2 



[^d]Leave out the courtyard which is outside the [^e]temple and do not measure it, because it has been given to the nations; and they will trample the holy city for forty-two months. 







###### 3 



And I will grant _authority_ to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for 1,260 days, clothed in sackcloth." 







###### 4 



These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth. 







###### 5 



And if anyone wants to harm them, fire flows out of their mouth and devours their enemies; and _so_ if anyone wants to harm them, he must be killed in this way. 







###### 6 



These have the power to shut up the sky, so that rain will not fall during the days of their prophesying; and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood, and to strike the earth with every plague, as often as they desire. 







###### 7 



When they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up out of the abyss will make war with them, and overcome them and kill them. 







###### 8 



And their dead bodies _will lie_ on the street of the great city which [^f]spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified. 







###### 9 



Those from the peoples, tribes, languages, and nations _will_ look at their dead [^g]bodies for three and a half days, and [^h]will not allow their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb. 







###### 10 



And those who live on the earth _will_ rejoice over them and celebrate; and they will send gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented those who live on the earth. 







###### 11 



And after the three and a half days, the breath of life from God came into them, and they stood on their feet; and great fear fell upon those who were watching them. 







###### 12 



And they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, "Come up here." And they went up into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies watched them. 







###### 13 



And [^i]at that time there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell; [^j]seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven. 







###### 14 



The second woe has passed; behold, the third woe is coming quickly. ## The Seventh Trumpet: Christ's Reign Foreseen 







###### 15 



Then the seventh angel sounded; and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, "The kingdom of the world has become _the kingdom_ of our Lord and of His [^k]Christ; and He will reign forever and ever." 







###### 16 



And the twenty-four elders, who sit on their thrones before God, fell on their faces and worshiped God, 







###### 17 



saying, "We give You thanks, Lord God, the Almighty, the One who is and who was, because You have taken Your great power and have begun to reign. 







###### 18 



And the nations were enraged, and Your wrath came, and the time _came_ for the dead to be judged, and _the time_ to [^l]reward Your bond-servants the prophets and the [^m]saints and those who fear Your name, the small and the great, and to destroy those who destroy the earth." 







###### 19 



And the [^n]temple of God which is in heaven was opened; and the ark of His covenant appeared in His [^o]temple, and there were flashes of lightning and sounds and peals of thunder, and an earthquake, and a great [^p]hailstorm. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

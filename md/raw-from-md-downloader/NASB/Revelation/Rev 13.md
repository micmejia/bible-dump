# Revelation 13

***








###### 1 



And _the dragon_ stood on the sand of the [^a]seashore. Then I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and on his horns _were_ ten crowns, and on his heads _were_ blasphemous names. 







###### 2 



And the beast that I saw was like a leopard, and his feet were like _those_ of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. And the dragon gave him his power and his throne, and great authority. 







###### 3 



_I saw_ one of his heads as if it had been [^b]fatally wounded, and his fatal wound was healed. And the whole earth was amazed _and followed_ after the beast; 







###### 4 



they worshiped the dragon because he gave his authority to the beast; and they worshiped the beast, saying, "Who is like the beast, and who is able to wage war with him?" 







###### 5 



A mouth was given to him speaking [^c]arrogant words and blasphemies, and authority to act for forty-two months was given to him. 







###### 6 



And he opened his mouth in blasphemies against God, to blaspheme His name and His tabernacle, _that is_, those who dwell in heaven. 







###### 7 



It was also given to him to make war with the [^d]saints and to overcome them, and authority was given to him over every tribe, people, language, and nation. 







###### 8 



All who live on the earth will worship him, _everyone_ whose name has not been [^e]written since the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb who has been slaughtered. 







###### 9 



If anyone has an ear, let him hear. 







###### 10 



If anyone [^f]_is destined_ for captivity, to captivity he goes; if anyone kills with the sword, with the sword he must be killed. Here is the [^g]perseverance and the faith of the [^h]saints. ## The Beast from the Earth 







###### 11 



Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke as a dragon. 







###### 12 



He exercises all the authority of the first beast [^i]in his presence. And he makes the earth and those who live on it worship the first beast, whose fatal wound was healed. 







###### 13 



He performs great signs, so that he even makes fire come down out of the sky to the earth in the presence of people. 







###### 14 



And he deceives those who live on the earth because of the signs which it was given him to perform [^j]in the presence of the beast, telling those who live on the earth to make an image to the beast who *had the wound of the sword and has come to life. 







###### 15 



And it was given to him to give breath to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast would even [^k]speak and cause all who do not worship the image of the beast to be killed. 







###### 16 



And he causes all, the small and the great, the rich and the poor, and the free and the slaves, [^l]to be given a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads, 







###### 17 



and _he decrees_ that no one will be able to buy or to sell, except the one who has the mark, _either_ the name of the beast or the number of his name. 







###### 18 



Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for the number is that of a [^m]man; and his number is [^n]six hundred and sixty-six. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

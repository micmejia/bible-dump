# Revelation 14

***








###### 1 



Then I looked, and behold, the Lamb _was_ standing on Mount Zion, and with Him 144,000 who had His name and the name of His Father written on their foreheads. 







###### 2 



And I heard a voice from heaven, like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder, and the voice which I heard _was_ like _the sound_ of harpists playing on their harps. 







###### 3 



And they *sang [^a]a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders; and no one was able to learn the song except the 144,000 who had been purchased from the earth. 







###### 4 



These are the ones who have not defiled themselves with women, for they are celibate. These _are_ the ones who follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These have been purchased from mankind as first fruits to God and to the Lamb. 







###### 5 



And no lie was found in their mouths; they are blameless. ## Vision of the Angel with the Gospel 







###### 6 



And I saw another angel flying in midheaven with an eternal gospel to preach to those who [^b]live on the earth, and to every nation, tribe, language, and people; 







###### 7 



and he said with a loud voice, "Fear God and give Him glory, because the hour of His judgment has come; worship Him who made the heaven and the earth, and sea and springs of waters." 







###### 8 



And another angel, a second one, followed, saying, "[^c]Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, she who has made all the nations drink of the wine of the [^d]passion of her sexual immorality." ## Doom for Worshipers of the Beast 







###### 9 



Then another angel, a third one, followed them, saying with a loud voice, "If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand, 







###### 10 



he also will drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is mixed [^e]in full strength in the cup of His anger; and he will be tormented with fire and [^f]brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. 







###### 11 



And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; they have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his image, and [^g]whoever receives the mark of his name." 







###### 12 



Here is the [^h]perseverance of the [^i]saints who keep the commandments of God and [^j]their faith in Jesus. 







###### 13 



And I heard a voice from heaven, saying, "Write: 'Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on!'" "Yes," says the Spirit, "so that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow with them." ## The Harvest 







###### 14 



Then I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and sitting on the cloud _was_ one like [^k]a son of man, with a golden crown on His head and a sharp sickle in His hand. 







###### 15 



And another angel came out of the [^l]temple, calling out with a loud voice to Him who sat on the cloud, "[^m]Put in your sickle and reap, for the hour to reap has come, because the harvest of the earth [^n]is ripe." 







###### 16 



Then He who sat on the cloud [^o]swung His sickle over the earth, and the earth was reaped. 







###### 17 



And another angel came out of the [^p]temple which is in heaven, and he also had a sharp sickle. 







###### 18 



Then another angel, the one who has power over fire, came out from the altar; and he called with a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, "[^q]Put in your sharp sickle and gather the clusters [^r]from the vine of the earth, because her grapes are ripe." 







###### 19 



So the angel [^s]swung his sickle to the earth and gathered _the clusters from_ the vine of the earth, and threw _them_ into the great wine press of the wrath of God. 







###### 20 



And the wine press was trampled outside the city, and blood came out from the wine press, up to the horses' bridles, [^t]for a distance of [^u]1,600 stadia. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

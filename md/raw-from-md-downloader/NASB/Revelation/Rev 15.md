# Revelation 15

***








###### 1 



Then I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven angels who had seven plagues, _which are_ the last, because in them the wrath of God is finished. 







###### 2 



And I saw _something_ like a sea of glass mixed with fire, and those who were victorious [^a]over the beast and his image and the number of his name, standing on the sea of glass, holding harps of God. 







###### 3 



And they *sang the song of Moses, the bond-servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, "Great and marvelous are Your works, Lord God, the Almighty; Righteous and true are Your ways, King of the [^b]nations! 







###### 4 



Who will not fear You, Lord, and glorify Your name? For You alone are holy; For all the nations will come and worship before You, For Your [^c]righteous acts have been revealed." 







###### 5 



After these things I looked, and the [^d]temple of the tabernacle of testimony in heaven was opened, 







###### 6 



and the seven angels who had the seven plagues came out of the [^e]temple, clothed in [^f]linen, clean _and_ bright, and their chests wrapped with golden sashes. 







###### 7 



And one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever. 







###### 8 



And the [^g]temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from His power; and no one was able to enter the [^h]temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

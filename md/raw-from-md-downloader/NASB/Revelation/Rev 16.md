# Revelation 16

***








###### 1 



Then I heard a loud voice from the [^a]temple, saying to the seven angels, "Go and pour out on the earth the seven bowls of the wrath of God." 







###### 2 



So the first _angel_ went and poured out his bowl on the earth; and a harmful and painful sore [^b]afflicted the people who had the mark of the beast and who worshiped his image. 







###### 3 



The second _angel_ poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became blood like _that_ of a dead man; and every living [^c]thing in the sea died. 







###### 4 



Then the third _angel_ poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of waters; and they became blood. 







###### 5 



And I heard the angel of the waters saying, "Righteous are You, the One who is and who was, O Holy One, because You judged these things; 







###### 6 



for they poured out the blood of saints and prophets, and You have given them blood to drink. They [^d]deserve it." 







###### 7 



And I heard the altar saying, "Yes, Lord God, the Almighty, true and righteous are Your judgments." 







###### 8 



And the fourth _angel_ poured out his bowl upon the sun, and it was given _power_ to scorch people with fire. 







###### 9 



And the people were scorched with [^e]fierce heat; and they blasphemed the name of God who has the power over these plagues, and they did not repent so as to give Him glory. 







###### 10 



And the fifth _angel_ poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and his kingdom became darkened; and they gnawed their tongues because of pain, 







###### 11 



and they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pain and their sores; and they did not repent of their deeds. 







###### 12 



The sixth _angel_ poured out his bowl on the great river, the Euphrates; and its water was dried up, so that the way would be prepared for the kings from the [^f]east. ## Har-Magedon (Armageddon) 







###### 13 



And I saw _coming_ out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs; 







###### 14 



for they are spirits of demons, performing signs, which go out to the kings of the entire [^g]world, to gather them together for the war of the great day of God, the Almighty. 







###### 15 



("Behold, I am coming like a thief. Blessed is the one who stays awake and keeps his clothes, so that he will not walk about naked and _people_ will not see his shame.") 







###### 16 



And they gathered them together to the place which in Hebrew is called Har-Magedon. ## The Seventh Bowl of Wrath 







###### 17 



Then the seventh _angel_ poured out his bowl upon the air, and a loud voice came out of the [^h]temple from the throne, saying, "It is done." 







###### 18 



And there were flashes of lightning and sounds and peals of thunder; and there was a great earthquake, such as there had not been since mankind came to be upon the earth, so great an earthquake _was it, and_ so mighty. 







###### 19 



The great city [^i]was split into three parts, and the cities of the [^j]nations fell. Babylon the great was remembered in the sight of God, to give her the cup of the wine of [^k]His fierce wrath. 







###### 20 



And every island fled, and no mountains were found. 







###### 21 



And huge [^l]hailstones, weighing about [^m]a talent each, *came down from heaven upon people; and people blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail, because [^n]the hailstone plague *was extremely [^o]severe. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

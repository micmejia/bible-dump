# Revelation 17

***








###### 1 



Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, "Come here, I will show you the judgment of the great prostitute who sits on many waters, 







###### 2 



with whom the kings of the earth committed _acts of_ sexual immorality, and those who live on the earth became drunk with the wine of her sexual immorality." 







###### 3 



And he carried me away [^a]in the Spirit into a wilderness; and I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast, full of blasphemous names, having seven heads and ten horns. 







###### 4 



The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and [^b]adorned with gold, precious [^c]stones, and pearls, holding in her hand a gold cup full of abominations and of the unclean things of her sexual immorality, 







###### 5 



and on her forehead a name _was_ written, [^d]a mystery: "BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF PROSTITUTES AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH." 







###### 6 



And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the [^e]saints, and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. When I saw her, I wondered [^f]greatly. 







###### 7 



And the angel said to me, "Why [^g]do you wonder? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns. 







###### 8 



"The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to come up out of the abyss and [^h]go to destruction. And those who live on the earth, whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, will wonder when they see the beast, that he was, and is not, and will [^i]come. 







###### 9 



Here is the mind which has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains upon which the woman sits, 







###### 10 



and they are seven kings; five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; and when he comes, he must remain a little while. 







###### 11 



The beast which was, and is not, is himself also an eighth and is _one_ of the seven, and he goes to destruction. 







###### 12 



The ten horns which you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but they receive authority as kings with the beast for one hour. 







###### 13 



These have one [^j]purpose, and they give their power and authority to the beast. ## Victory for the Lamb 







###### 14 



These will wage war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them because He is Lord of lords and King of kings; and those who are with Him _are the_ called and chosen and faithful." 







###### 15 



And he *said to me, "The waters which you saw where the prostitute sits are peoples and multitudes, and nations and languages. 







###### 16 



And the ten horns which you saw, and the beast, these will hate the prostitute and will make her desolate and naked, and will eat her flesh and will burn her up with fire. 







###### 17 



For God has put it in their hearts to execute His [^k]purpose [^l]by having a common purpose, and by giving their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God will be fulfilled. 







###### 18 



The woman whom you saw is the great city, which [^m]reigns over the kings of the earth." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

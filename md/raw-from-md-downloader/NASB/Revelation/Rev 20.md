# Revelation 20

***








###### 1 



Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding the key of the abyss and a great chain [^a]in his hand. 







###### 2 



And he took hold of the dragon, the serpent of old, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years; 







###### 3 



and he threw him into the abyss and shut _it_ and sealed _it_ over him, so that he would not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were completed; after these things he must be released for a short time. 







###### 4 



Then I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them. And _I saw_ the souls of those who had been beheaded because of [^b]their testimony of Jesus and because of the word of God, and those who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received the mark on their foreheads and on their hands; and they came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years. 







###### 5 



The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were completed. This is the first resurrection. 







###### 6 



Blessed and holy is the one who has a part in the first resurrection; over these the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and will reign with Him for a thousand years. ## Satan Freed and Doomed 







###### 7 



When the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released from his prison, 







###### 8 



and will come out to deceive the nations which are at the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for the war; the number of them is like the sand of the [^c]seashore. 







###### 9 



And they came up on the [^d]broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the [^e]saints and the beloved city, and fire came down from heaven and devoured them. 







###### 10 



And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and [^f]brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet _are_ also; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever. ## Judgment at the Throne of God 







###### 11 



Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat upon it, from whose [^g]presence earth and heaven fled, and no place was found for them. 







###### 12 



And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and [^h]books were opened; and another [^i]book was opened, which is _the book_ of life; and the dead were judged from the things which were written in the [^j]books, according to their deeds. 







###### 13 



And the sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them; and they were judged, each one _of them_ according to their deeds. 







###### 14 



Then Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire. 







###### 15 



And if [^k]anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

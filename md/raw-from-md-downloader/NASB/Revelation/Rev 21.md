# Revelation 21

***








###### 1 



Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth passed away, and there is no longer _any_ sea. 







###### 2 



And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. 







###### 3 



And I heard a loud voice from the throne, saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God is among the people, and He will dwell among them, and they shall be His [^a]people, and God Himself will be among them[^b], 







###### 4 



and He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there will no longer be _any_ death; there will no longer be _any_ mourning, or crying, or pain; the first things have passed away." 







###### 5 



And He who sits on the throne said, "Behold, I am making all things new." And He *said, "Write, for these words are faithful and true." 







###### 6 



Then He said to me, "[^c]It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give _water_ to the one who thirsts from the spring of the water of life, without cost. 







###### 7 



The one who overcomes will inherit these things, and I will be his God and he will be My son. 







###### 8 



But for the cowardly, and [^d]unbelieving, and abominable, and murderers, and sexually immoral persons, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, their part _will be_ in the lake that burns with fire and [^e]brimstone, which is the second death." 







###### 9 



Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls, [^f]full of the seven last plagues, came and spoke with me, saying, "Come here, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb." ## The New Jerusalem 







###### 10 



And he carried me away [^g]in _the_ Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, 







###### 11 



having the glory of God. Her [^h]brilliance was like a very valuable stone, like a stone of crystal-clear jasper. 







###### 12 



[^i]It had a great and high wall, [^j]with twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels; and names _were_ written on _the gates_, which are _the names_ of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel. 







###### 13 



_There were_ three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west. 







###### 14 



And the wall of the city had twelve foundation stones, and on them _were the_ twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. 







###### 15 



The one who spoke with me had a [^k]gold measuring rod to measure the city, its gates, and its wall. 







###### 16 



The city is laid out as a square, and its length is as great as the width; and he measured the city with the [^l]rod, [^m]twelve thousand stadia; its length, width, and height are equal. 







###### 17 



And he measured its wall, [^n]144 cubits, _by_ human [^o]measurements, which are _also_ angelic _measurements_. 







###### 18 



The material of the wall was jasper; and the city was pure gold, like [^p]clear glass. 







###### 19 



The foundation stones of the city wall were decorated with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation stone was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald; 







###### 20 



the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst. 







###### 21 



And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the gates was a single pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass. 







###### 22 



I saw no [^q]temple in it, for the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are its [^r]temple. 







###### 23 



And the city has no need of the sun or of the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God has illuminated it, and its lamp _is_ the Lamb. 







###### 24 



The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth [^s]will bring their glory into it. 







###### 25 



In the daytime (for there will be no night there) its gates will never be closed; 







###### 26 



and they will bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it; 







###### 27 



and nothing unclean, and no one who practices abomination and lying, shall ever come into it, but only those [^t]whose names are written in the Lamb's book of life. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

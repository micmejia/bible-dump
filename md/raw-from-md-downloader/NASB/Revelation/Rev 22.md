# Revelation 22

***








###### 1 



And he showed me a river of the water of life, [^a]clear as crystal, coming from the throne of God and of [^b]the Lamb, 







###### 2 



in the middle of its street. On either side of the river _was_ the tree of life, bearing twelve [^c]_kinds of_ fruit, yielding its fruit every month; and the leaves of the tree _were_ for the healing of the nations. 







###### 3 



There will no longer be any curse; and the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and His bond-servants will serve Him; 







###### 4 



they will see His face, and His name _will be_ on their foreheads. 







###### 5 



And there will no longer be _any_ night; and they [^d]will not have need of the light of a lamp nor the light of the sun, because the Lord God will illuminate them; and they will reign forever and ever. 







###### 6 



And he said to me, "These words are faithful and true"; and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, sent His angel to show His bond-servants the things which must soon take place. 







###### 7 



"And behold, I am coming quickly. Blessed is the one who [^e]keeps the words of the prophecy of this book." 







###### 8 



I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. And when I heard and saw _them_, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed me these things. 







###### 9 



And he *said to me, "[^f]Do not do that; I am a fellow servant of yours and of your brothers the prophets, and of those who [^g]keep the words of this book. Worship God!" ## The Final Message 







###### 10 



And he *said to me, "Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near. 







###### 11 



Let the one who does wrong still do wrong, and the one who is filthy still be filthy; and let the one who is righteous still practice righteousness, and the one who is holy still keep himself holy." 







###### 12 



"Behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward _is_ with Me, to reward each one as his work [^h]deserves. 







###### 13 



I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end." 







###### 14 



Blessed are those who wash their robes, so that they will have the right to the tree of life, and may enter the city by the gates. 







###### 15 



Outside are the dogs, the sorcerers, the sexually immoral persons, the murderers, the idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices lying. 







###### 16 



"I, Jesus, have sent My angel to testify to you of these things [^i]for the churches. I am the root and the descendant of David, the bright morning star." 







###### 17 



The Spirit and the bride say, "Come." And let the one who hears say, "Come." And let the one who is thirsty come; let the one who desires, take the water of life without cost. 







###### 18 



I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book; 







###### 19 



and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his part from the tree of life and [^j]from the holy city, which are written in this book. 







###### 20 



He who testifies to these things says, "Yes, I am coming quickly." Amen. Come, Lord Jesus. 







###### 21 



The grace of the Lord Jesus be with [^k]all. Amen. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

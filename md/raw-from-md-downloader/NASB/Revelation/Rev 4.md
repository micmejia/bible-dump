# Revelation 4

***








###### 1 



After these things I looked, and behold, a door _standing_ open in heaven, and the first voice which I had heard, like _the sound_ of a trumpet speaking with me, said, "Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after these things." 







###### 2 



Immediately I was in _the_ [^a]Spirit; and behold, a throne was standing in heaven, and _someone was_ sitting on the throne. 







###### 3 



And He who was sitting _was_ like a jasper stone and a sardius in appearance; and _there was_ a [^b]rainbow around the throne, like an emerald in appearance. 







###### 4 



Around the throne _were_ twenty-four thrones; and upon the thrones _I saw_ twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white garments, and golden crowns on their heads. ## The Throne and Worship of the Creator 







###### 5 



Out from the throne *came flashes of lightning and sounds and peals of thunder. And _there were_ seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are [^c]the seven spirits of God; 







###### 6 



and before the throne _there was something_ like a sea of glass, like crystal; and in the [^d]center and around the throne, four living creatures full of eyes in front and behind. 







###### 7 



The first living creature _was_ like a lion, the second creature like a calf, the third creature had a face like that of a man, and the fourth creature _was_ like a flying eagle. 







###### 8 



And the four living creatures, each one of them having six wings, are full of eyes around and within; and day and night [^e]they do not cease to say, "Holy, holy, holy _is_ the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who [^f]is to come." 







###### 9 



And when the living creatures give glory, honor, and thanks to Him who sits on the throne, to Him who lives forever and ever, 







###### 10 



the twenty-four elders will fall down before Him who sits on the throne, and they will worship Him who lives forever and ever, and will cast their crowns before the throne, saying, 







###### 11

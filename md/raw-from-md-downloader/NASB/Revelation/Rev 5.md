# Revelation 5

***








###### 1 



I saw [^a]in the right hand of Him who sat on the throne a [^b]scroll written inside and on the back, sealed up with seven seals. 







###### 2 



And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open the scroll and to break its seals?" 







###### 3 



And no one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it. 







###### 4 



Then I _began_ to weep greatly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it. 







###### 5 



And one of the elders *said to me, "Stop weeping; behold, the Lion that is from the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome _so as to be able_ to open the scroll and its seven seals." 







###### 6 



And I saw [^c]between the throne (with the four living creatures) and the elders a Lamb standing, as if slaughtered, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are [^d]the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth. 







###### 7 



And He came and took _the scroll_ out of the right hand of Him who sat on the throne. 







###### 8 



When He had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each one holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the [^e]saints. 







###### 9 



And they *sang a new song, saying, "Worthy are You to take the scroll and to break its seals; for You were slaughtered, and You purchased _people_ for God with Your blood from every tribe, language, people, and nation. 







###### 10 



You have made them _into_ a kingdom and priests to our God, and they will reign upon the earth." ## Angels Exalt the Lamb 







###### 11 



Then I looked, and I heard the voices of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders; and the number of them was [^f]myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands, 







###### 12 



saying with a loud voice, "Worthy is the Lamb that was slaughtered to receive power, wealth, wisdom, might, honor, glory, and blessing." 







###### 13 



And I heard every created thing which is in heaven, or on the earth, or under the earth, or on the sea, and all the things in them, saying, "To Him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb _be_ the blessing, the honor, the glory, and the dominion forever and ever." 







###### 14 



And the four living creatures were saying, "Amen." And the elders fell down and worshiped. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Revelation 8

***








###### 1 



When _the Lamb_ broke the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour. 







###### 2 



And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them. 







###### 3 



Another angel came and stood at the altar, holding a golden censer; and much incense was given to him, so that he might [^a]add it to the prayers of all the [^b]saints on the golden altar which was before the throne. 







###### 4 



And the smoke of the incense ascended from the angel's hand with the prayers of the [^c]saints before God. 







###### 5 



Then the angel [^d]took the [^e]censer and filled it with the fire of the altar, and hurled it to the earth; and there were peals of thunder and sounds, and flashes of lightning and an earthquake. 







###### 6 



And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound them. 







###### 7 



The first sounded, and there was hail and fire mixed with blood, and it was hurled to the earth; and a third of the earth was burned up, and a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up. 







###### 8 



The second angel sounded, and _something_ like a great mountain burning with fire was hurled into the sea; and a third of the sea became blood, 







###### 9 



and a third of the creatures which were in the sea [^f]and had life, died; and a third of the ships were destroyed. 







###### 10 



The third angel sounded, and a great star fell from heaven, burning like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of waters. 







###### 11 



The star is named Wormwood; and a third of the waters became wormwood, and many people died from the waters because they were made bitter. 







###### 12 



The fourth angel sounded, and a third of the sun, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars were struck, so that a third of them would be darkened and the day would not shine for a third of it, and the night in the same way. 







###### 13 



Then I looked, and I heard [^g]an eagle flying in midheaven, saying with a loud voice, "Woe, woe, woe to those who live on the earth, because of the remaining blasts of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to sound!" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

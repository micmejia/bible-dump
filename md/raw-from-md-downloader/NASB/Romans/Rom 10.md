# Romans 10

***








###### 1 



Brothers _and sisters_, my heart's desire and my prayer to God for them is for _their_ salvation. 







###### 2 



For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but not in accordance with knowledge. 







###### 3 



For not knowing about God's righteousness and seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God. 







###### 4 



For Christ is the [^a]end of the Law for righteousness to everyone who believes. 







###### 5 



For Moses writes of the righteousness that is [^b]based on the Law, that the person who performs [^c]them will live by [^d]them. 







###### 6 



But the righteousness [^e]based on faith speaks as follows: "Do not say in your heart, 'Who will go up into heaven?' (that is, to bring Christ down), 







###### 7 



or 'Who will descend into the abyss?' (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead)." 







###### 8 



But what does it say? "The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart"--that is, the word of faith which we are preaching, 







###### 9 



[^f]that if you confess with your mouth Jesus _as_ Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved; 







###### 10 



for with the heart _a person_ believes, [^g]resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses, [^h]resulting in salvation. 







###### 11 



For the Scripture says, "Whoever believes in Him will not be [^i]put to shame." 







###### 12 



For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same _Lord_ is Lord of all, abounding in riches for all who call on Him; 







###### 13 



for "Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved." 







###### 14 



How then are they to call on Him in whom they have not believed? How are they to believe in Him whom they have not heard? And how are they to hear without a preacher? 







###### 15 



But how are they to preach unless they are sent? Just as it is written: "How beautiful are the feet of those who [^j]bring good news of good things!" 







###### 16 



However, they did not all heed the [^k]good news; for Isaiah says, "Lord, who has believed our report?" 







###### 17 



So faith _comes_ from hearing, and hearing by the word [^l]of Christ. 







###### 18 



But I say, surely they have never heard, have they? On the contrary: "Their voice has gone out into all the earth, And their words to the ends of the [^m]world." 







###### 19 



But I say, surely Israel did not know, did they? First Moses says, "I will make you jealous with _those who are_ not a nation, With a foolish nation I will anger you." 







###### 20 



And Isaiah is very bold and says, "I was found by those who did not seek Me, I revealed Myself to those who did not ask for Me." 







###### 21 



But as for Israel, He says, "I have spread out My hands all day long to a disobedient and obstinate people." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

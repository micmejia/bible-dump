# Romans 11

***








###### 1 



I say then, God has not rejected His people, has He? [^a]Far from it! For I too am an Israelite, [^b]a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. 







###### 2 



God has not rejected His people whom He foreknew. Or do you not know what the Scripture says in _the passage about_ Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel? 







###### 3 



"Lord, they have killed Your prophets, they have torn down Your altars, and I alone am left, and they are seeking my life." 







###### 4 



But what [^c]is the divine response to him? "I have kept for Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal." 







###### 5 



In the same way then, there has also come to be at the present time a remnant according to _God's_ [^d]gracious choice. 







###### 6 



But if _it is_ by grace, _it is_ no longer [^e]on the basis of works, since _otherwise_ grace is no longer grace. 







###### 7 



What then? What Israel is seeking, it has not obtained, but [^f]those who were chosen obtained it, and the rest were hardened; 







###### 8 



just as it is written: "God gave them a spirit of stupor, Eyes to see not and ears to hear not, Down to this very day." 







###### 9 



And David says, "May their table become a snare and a trap, And a stumbling block and a retribution to them. 







###### 10 



May their eyes be darkened to see not, And bend their backs continually." 







###### 11 



I say then, they did not stumble so as to fall, did they? [^g]Far from it! But by their wrongdoing salvation _has come_ to the Gentiles, to make them jealous. 







###### 12 



Now if their wrongdoing _proves to be_ riches for the world, and their failure, riches for the Gentiles, how much more _will_ their [^h]fulfillment _be_! 







###### 13 



But I am speaking to you who are Gentiles. Therefore insofar as I am an apostle of Gentiles, I magnify my ministry 







###### 14 



if somehow I may move my [^i]own people to jealousy and save some of them. 







###### 15 



For if their rejection _proves to be_ the reconciliation of the world, what _will their_ acceptance _be_ but life from the dead? 







###### 16 



If the first piece _of dough_ is holy, the lump is also; and if the root is holy, the branches are as well. 







###### 17 



But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in among them and became partaker with them of the [^j]rich root of the olive tree, 







###### 18 



do not be arrogant toward the branches; but if you are arrogant, _remember that_ it is not you who supports the root, but the root _supports_ you. 







###### 19 



You will say then, "Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in." 







###### 20 



Quite right, they were broken off for their unbelief, but you stand by your faith. Do not be conceited, but fear; 







###### 21 



for if God did not spare the natural branches, He will not spare you, either. 







###### 22 



See then the kindness and severity of God: to those who fell, severity, but to you, God's kindness, if you continue in His kindness; for otherwise you too will be cut off. 







###### 23 



And they also, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in; for God is able to graft them in again. 







###### 24 



For if you were cut off from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these who are the natural _branches_ be grafted into their own olive tree? 







###### 25 



For I do not want you, brothers _and sisters_, to be uninformed of this mystery--so that you will not be wise in your own estimation--that a partial hardening has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in; 







###### 26 



and so all Israel will be saved; just as it is written: "The Deliverer will come from Zion, He will remove ungodliness from Jacob." 







###### 27 



"This is [^k]My covenant with them, When I take away their sins." 







###### 28 



In relation to the gospel _they are_ enemies on your account, but in relation to _God's_ choice _they are_ beloved on account of the fathers; 







###### 29 



for the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable. 







###### 30 



For just as you once were disobedient to God, but now have been shown mercy because of their disobedience, 







###### 31 



so these also now have been disobedient, that because of the mercy shown to you they also may now be shown mercy. 







###### 32 



For God has shut up all in disobedience, so that He may show mercy to all. 







###### 33 



Oh, the depth of the riches, [^l]both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and unfathomable His ways! 







###### 34 



For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who became His counselor? 







###### 35 



Or who has first given to Him, [^m]that it would be paid back to him? 







###### 36 



For from Him, and through Him, and to Him are all things. To Him _be_ the glory [^n]forever. Amen. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

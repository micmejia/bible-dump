# Romans 12

***








###### 1 



Therefore I urge you, brothers _and sisters_, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living and holy sacrifice, [^a]acceptable to God, _which is_ your [^b]spiritual service of worship. 







###### 2 



And do not be conformed to this [^c]world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may [^d]prove what the will of God is, that which is good and [^e]acceptable and perfect. 







###### 3 



For through the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think; but to think so as to have sound judgment, as God has allotted to each a measure of faith. 







###### 4 



For just as we have many parts in one body and all [^f]the body's parts do not have the same function, 







###### 5 



so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually parts of one another. 







###### 6 



However, since we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, _each of us is to use them properly_: if prophecy, [^g]in proportion to _one's_ faith; 







###### 7 



if [^h]service, in the _act of_ serving; or the one who teaches, in the _act of_ teaching; 







###### 8 



or the one who [^i]exhorts, in the _work of_ [^j]exhortation; the one who gives, with [^k]generosity; the one who [^l]is in leadership, with diligence; the one who shows mercy, with cheerfulness. 







###### 9 



[^m]Love _must be_ free of hypocrisy. Detest what is evil; cling to what is good. 







###### 10 



_Be_ devoted to one another in brotherly love; [^n]give preference to one another in honor, 







###### 11 



not lagging behind in diligence, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord; 







###### 12 



rejoicing in hope, persevering in tribulation, devoted to prayer, 







###### 13 



contributing to the needs of the [^o]saints, [^p]practicing hospitality. 







###### 14 



Bless those who persecute [^q]you; bless and do not curse. 







###### 15 



Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep. 







###### 16 



Be of the same mind toward one another; do not be [^r]haughty in mind, but [^s]associate with the lowly. Do not be wise in your own estimation. 







###### 17 



Never repay evil for evil to anyone. [^t]Respect what is right in the sight of all people. 







###### 18 



If possible, so far as it depends on you, be at peace with all people. 







###### 19 



Never take your own revenge, beloved, but [^u]leave room for the wrath _of God_, for it is written: "Vengeance is Mine, I will repay," says the Lord. 







###### 20 



"But if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him a drink; for in so doing you will heap burning coals on his head." 







###### 21 



Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

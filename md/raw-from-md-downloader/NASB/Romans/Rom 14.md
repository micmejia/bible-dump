# Romans 14

***








###### 1 



Now accept the one who is weak [^a]in faith, _but_ not [^b]to have quarrels over opinions. 







###### 2 



One person has faith that he may eat all things, but the one who is weak eats _only_ vegetables. 







###### 3 



The one who eats is not to regard with contempt the one who does not eat, and the one who does not eat is not to judge the one who eats, for God has accepted him. 







###### 4 



Who are you to judge the [^c]servant of another? To his own [^d]master he stands or falls; and he will stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand. 







###### 5 



One _person_ [^e]values one day over another, another [^f]values every day _the same_. Each person must be fully convinced in his own mind. 







###### 6 



The one who observes the day, observes it for the Lord, and the one who eats, [^g]does so with regard to the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and the one who does not eat, _it is_ for the Lord _that_ he does not eat, and he gives thanks to God. 







###### 7 



For not one of us lives for himself, and not one dies for himself; 







###### 8 



for if we live, we live for the Lord, or if we die, we die for the Lord; therefore whether we live or die, we are the Lord's. 







###### 9 



For to this _end_ Christ died and lived _again_, that He might be Lord both of the dead and of the living. 







###### 10 



But _as for_ you, why do you judge your brother _or sister_? Or you as well, why do you regard your brother _or sister_ with contempt? For we will all appear before the judgment seat of God. 







###### 11 



For it is written: "As I live, says the Lord, to Me every knee will bow, And every tongue will [^h]give praise to God." 







###### 12 



So then each one of us will give an account of himself to God. 







###### 13 



Therefore let's not judge one another anymore, but rather [^i]determine this: not to put an obstacle or a stumbling block in a brother's _or sister's_ way. 







###### 14 



I know and am convinced [^j]in the Lord Jesus that nothing is [^k]unclean in itself; but to the one who thinks something is [^l]unclean, to that _person it is_ [^m]unclean. 







###### 15 



For if because of food your brother _or sister_ is hurt, you are no longer walking in accordance with love. Do not destroy with your _choice_ of food that _person_ for whom Christ died. 







###### 16 



Therefore do not let what is for you a good thing be [^n]spoken of as evil; 







###### 17 



for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. 







###### 18 



For the one who serves Christ in this _way_ is acceptable to God and approved by _other_ people. 







###### 19 



So then we pursue the things [^o]which make for peace and the building up of one another. 







###### 20 



Do not tear down the work of God for the sake of food. All things indeed are clean, but they are evil for the person who eats [^p]and causes offense. 







###### 21 



It is good not to eat meat or to drink wine, or _to do anything_ by which your brother _or sister_ stumbles. 







###### 22 



The faith which you have, have [^q]as your own conviction before God. Happy is the one who does not condemn himself in what he approves. 







###### 23 



But the one who doubts is condemned if he eats, because _his eating is_ not from faith; and whatever is not from faith is sin. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

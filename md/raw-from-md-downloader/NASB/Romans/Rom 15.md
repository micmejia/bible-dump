# Romans 15

***








###### 1 



Now we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of those without strength, and not _just_ please ourselves. 







###### 2 



Each of us is to please his neighbor [^a]for his good, to _his_ edification. 







###### 3 



For even Christ did not please Himself, but as it is written: "The taunts of those who taunt You have fallen on Me." 







###### 4 



For whatever was written in earlier times was written for our instruction, so that through perseverance and the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope. 







###### 5 



Now may the God [^b]who gives perseverance and encouragement grant you to be of the same mind with one another, according to Christ Jesus, 







###### 6 



so that with one purpose _and_ one [^c]voice you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. 







###### 7 



Therefore, [^d]accept one another, just as Christ also accepted [^e]us, for the glory of God. 







###### 8 



For I say that Christ has become a servant to the circumcision in behalf of the truth of God, to confirm the promises _given_ to the fathers, 







###### 9 



and for the Gentiles to glorify God for His mercy; as it is written: "Therefore I will [^f]give praise to You among the Gentiles, And I will sing praises to Your name." 







###### 10 



Again he says, "Rejoice, you Gentiles, with His people." 







###### 11 



And again, "Praise the Lord all you Gentiles, And let all the peoples praise Him." 







###### 12 



Again Isaiah says, "There shall come the root of Jesse, And He who arises to rule over the Gentiles, In Him will the Gentiles hope." 







###### 13 



Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you will abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit. 







###### 14 



And concerning you, my brothers _and sisters_, I myself also am convinced that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge and able also to admonish one another. 







###### 15 



But I have written very boldly to you on some points so as to remind you again, because of the grace that was given to me [^g]from God, 







###### 16 



to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, ministering as a priest the gospel of God, so that _my_ offering of the Gentiles may become acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit. 







###### 17 



Therefore in Christ Jesus I have found reason for boasting in things pertaining to God. 







###### 18 



For I will not presume to speak of anything [^h]except what Christ has accomplished through me, [^i]resulting in the obedience of the Gentiles by word and deed, 







###### 19 



in the power of [^j]signs and wonders, in the power of the Spirit; so that from Jerusalem and all around as far as Illyricum I have [^k]fully preached the gospel of Christ. 







###### 20 



And in this way I aspired to preach the gospel, not where Christ was _already_ known by name, so that I would not build on another person's foundation; 







###### 21 



but just as it is written: "They who have not been told about Him will see, And they who have not heard will understand." 







###### 22 



For this reason I have often been prevented from coming to you; 







###### 23 



but now, with no further place for me in these regions, and since I have had for many years a longing to come to you 







###### 24 



whenever I go to Spain--for I hope to see you in passing, and to be helped on my way there by you, when I have first enjoyed your company [^l]for a while-- 







###### 25 



but now, I am going to Jerusalem, serving the [^m]saints. 







###### 26 



For Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the [^n]saints in Jerusalem. 







###### 27 



For they were pleased _to do so_, and they are indebted to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual things, they are indebted to do them a service also in material things. 







###### 28 



Therefore, when I have finished this, and have [^o]put my seal on this fruit of theirs, I will go on by way of you to Spain. 







###### 29 



I know that when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ. 







###### 30 



Now I urge you, brothers _and sisters_, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in your prayers to God for me, 







###### 31 



that I may be rescued from those who are disobedient in Judea, and _that_ my service for Jerusalem may prove acceptable to the [^p]saints; 







###### 32 



so that I may come to you in joy by the will of God and relax in your company. 







###### 33 



Now the God of peace _be_ with you all. Amen. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Romans 2

***








###### 1 



Therefore you have no excuse, [^a]you _foolish_ person, everyone _of you_ who passes judgment; for [^b]in that _matter in_ which you judge someone else, you condemn yourself; for you who judge practice the same things. 







###### 2 



And we know that the judgment of God [^c]rightly falls upon those who practice such things. 







###### 3 



But do you suppose this, [^d]you _foolish_ person who passes judgment on those who practice such things, and _yet_ does them _as well_, that you will escape the judgment of God? 







###### 4 



Or do you think lightly of the riches of His kindness and [^e]restraint and patience, not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance? 







###### 5 



But [^f]because of your stubbornness and unrepentant heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God, 







###### 6 



who will repay each person according to his deeds: 







###### 7 



to those who by perseverance in doing good seek glory, honor, and immortality, _He will give_ eternal life; 







###### 8 



but to those who are self-serving and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, _He will give_ wrath and indignation. 







###### 9 



_There will be_ tribulation and distress [^g]for every soul of mankind who does evil, [^h]for the Jew first and also [^i]for the Greek, 







###### 10 



but glory, honor, and peace to everyone who does what is good, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. 







###### 11 



For there is no partiality with God. 







###### 12 



For all who have sinned [^j]without the Law will also perish [^k]without the Law, and all who have sinned [^l]under the Law will be judged [^m]by the Law; 







###### 13 



for _it is_ not the hearers [^n]of the Law _who_ are [^o]righteous before God, but the doers [^p]of the Law _who_ will be justified. 







###### 14 



For when Gentiles who do not have [^q]the Law [^r]instinctively perform the _requirements_ of the Law, these, though not having [^s]the Law, are a law to themselves, 







###### 15 



in that they show the work of the Law written in their hearts, their conscience testifying and their thoughts alternately accusing or else defending them, 







###### 16 



on the day when, according to my gospel, God will judge the secrets of mankind through Christ Jesus. ## The Jews under the Law 







###### 17 



But if you call yourself a [^t]Jew and rely [^u]upon the Law and boast in God, 







###### 18 



and know _His_ will and [^v]distinguish the things that matter, being instructed from the Law, 







###### 19 



and are confident that you yourself are a guide to people who are blind, a light to those in darkness, 







###### 20 



a [^w]corrector of the foolish, a teacher of [^x]the immature, possessing in the Law the embodiment of knowledge and of the truth-- 







###### 21 



_you_, therefore, who teach someone else, do you not teach yourself? _You_ who [^y]preach that one is not to steal, do you steal? 







###### 22 



_You_ who say that one is not to commit adultery, do you commit adultery? _You_ who loathe idols, do you rob temples? 







###### 23 



You who boast [^z]in the Law, through your breaking the Law, do you dishonor God? 







###### 24 



For "the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you," just as it is written. 







###### 25 



For indeed circumcision is of value if you practice [^aa]the Law; but if you are a violator [^ab]of the Law, your circumcision has turned into uncircumcision. 







###### 26 



So if the [^ac]uncircumcised man keeps the requirements of the Law, will his uncircumcision not be regarded as circumcision? 







###### 27 



And he who is physically uncircumcised, if he keeps the Law, will he not judge you who [^ad]though having the letter _of the Law_ and circumcision are a violator [^ae]of the Law? 







###### 28 



For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is circumcision that which is outward in the flesh. 







###### 29 



But he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter; and his praise is not from people, but from God. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Romans 3

***








###### 1 



Then what [^a]advantage does the Jew have? Or what is the benefit of circumcision? 







###### 2 



Great in every respect. First, that they were entrusted with the actual words of God. 







###### 3 



What then? If some [^b]did not believe, their [^c]unbelief will not nullify the faithfulness of God, will it? 







###### 4 



[^d]Far from it! Rather, God must prove to be true, though every person _be found_ a liar, as it is written: "So that You are justified in Your words, And prevail [^e]when You are judged." 







###### 5 



But if our unrighteousness [^f]demonstrates the righteousness of God, what shall we say? The God who inflicts wrath is not unrighteous, is He? (I am speaking from a human viewpoint.) 







###### 6 



Far from it! For _otherwise_, how will God judge the world? 







###### 7 



But if through my lie the truth of God abounded to His glory, why am I also still being judged as a sinner? 







###### 8 



And _why_ not _say_ (just as we are slanderously reported and as some claim that we say), "Let's do evil that good may come _of it_"? [^g]Their condemnation is deserved. 







###### 9 



What then? [^h]Are we better _than they_? Not at all; for we have already charged that both Jews and Greeks are all under sin; 







###### 10 



as it is written: "There is no righteous person, not even one; 







###### 11 



There is no one who understands, There is no one who seeks out God; 







###### 12 



They have all turned aside, together they have become [^i]corrupt; There is no one who does good, There is not even one." 







###### 13 



"Their throat is an open grave, With their tongues they keep deceiving," "The venom of [^j]asps is under their lips"; 







###### 14 



"Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness"; 







###### 15 



"Their feet are swift to shed blood, 







###### 16 



Destruction and misery are in their paths, 







###### 17 



And they have not known the way of peace." 







###### 18 



"There is no fear of God before their eyes." 







###### 19 



Now we know that whatever the Law says, it speaks to those who are [^k]under the Law, so that every mouth may be closed and all the world may become accountable to God; 







###### 20 



because by the works [^l]of the Law [^m]none of mankind will be justified in His sight; for [^n]through the Law _comes_ [^o]knowledge of sin. ## Justification by Faith 







###### 21 



But now apart [^p]from the Law _the_ righteousness of God has been revealed, being witnessed by the [^q]Law and the Prophets, 







###### 22 



but _it is the_ righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all those [^r]who believe; for there is no distinction, 







###### 23 



for all [^s]have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 







###### 24 



being justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus, 







###### 25 



whom God displayed publicly as a [^t]propitiation [^u]in His blood through faith. _This was_ to demonstrate His righteousness, [^v]because in God's _merciful_ restraint He let the sins previously committed go unpunished; 







###### 26 



for the demonstration, _that is_, of His righteousness at the present time, so that He would be just and the justifier of the one who [^w]has faith in Jesus. 







###### 27 



Where then is boasting? It has been excluded. By what kind of law? Of works? No, but by a law of faith. 







###### 28 



[^x]For we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from works [^y]of the Law. 







###### 29 



Or is God _the God_ of Jews only? Is He not _the God_ of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also, 







###### 30 



since indeed God who will justify the [^z]circumcised [^aa]by faith and the [^ab]uncircumcised through faith is one. 







###### 31 



Do we then nullify [^ac]the Law through faith? Far from it! On the contrary, we establish the Law. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

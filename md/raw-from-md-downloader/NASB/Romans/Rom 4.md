# Romans 4

***








###### 1 



What then shall we say that Abraham, [^a]our forefather according to the flesh, has found? 







###### 2 



For if Abraham was justified [^b]by works, he has something to boast about; but not [^c]before God. 







###### 3 



For what does the Scripture say? "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness." 







###### 4 



Now to the one who works, the wages are not credited as a favor, but as what is due. 







###### 5 



But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness, 







###### 6 



just as David also speaks of the blessing of the person to whom God credits righteousness apart from works: 







###### 7 



"Blessed are those whose lawless deeds have been forgiven, And whose sins have been covered. 







###### 8 



Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will not take into account." 







###### 9 



Is this blessing then on [^d]the circumcised, or on [^e]the uncircumcised also? For we say, "Faith was credited to Abraham as righteousness." 







###### 10 



How then was it credited? While he was [^f]circumcised, or [^g]uncircumcised? Not while [^h]circumcised, but while [^i]uncircumcised; 







###### 11 



and he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which [^j]he had while uncircumcised, so that he might be the father of all who believe without being circumcised, that righteousness might be credited to them, 







###### 12 



and the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision, but who also follow in the steps of the faith of our father Abraham which [^k]he had while uncircumcised. 







###### 13 



For the promise to Abraham or to his [^l]descendants that he would be heir of the world was not [^m]through the Law, but through the righteousness of faith. 







###### 14 



For if those who are [^n]of the Law are heirs, then faith is made void and the promise is nullified; 







###### 15 



for the Law brings about wrath, but where there is no law, there also is no violation. 







###### 16 



For this reason _it is_ [^o]by faith, in order that _it may be_ in accordance with grace, so that the promise will be guaranteed to all the [^p]descendants, not only to [^q]those who are of the Law, but also to [^r]those who are of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all, 







###### 17 



(as it is written: "I have made you a father of many nations") in the presence of Him whom he believed, _that is_, God, who gives life to the dead and calls into being things that do not exist. 







###### 18 



In hope against hope he believed, so that he might become a father of many nations according to that which had been spoken, "So shall your [^s]descendants be." 







###### 19 



Without becoming weak in faith he contemplated his own body, now _as good as_ dead since he was about a hundred years old, and the deadness of Sarah's womb; 







###### 20 



yet, with respect to the promise of God, he did not waver in unbelief but grew strong in faith, giving glory to God, 







###### 21 



and being fully assured that what _God_ had promised, He was able also to perform. 







###### 22 



Therefore it was also credited to him as righteousness. 







###### 23 



Now not for his sake only was it written that it was credited to him, 







###### 24 



but for our sake also, to whom it will be credited, to _us_ who believe in Him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead, 







###### 25 



_He_ who was delivered over because of our wrongdoings, and was raised because of our justification. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

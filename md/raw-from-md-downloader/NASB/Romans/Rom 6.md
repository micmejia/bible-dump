# Romans 6

***








###### 1 



What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin so that grace may increase? 







###### 2 



[^a]Far from it! How shall we who died to sin still live in it? 







###### 3 



Or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death? 







###### 4 



Therefore we have been buried with Him through baptism into death, so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too may walk in newness of life. 







###### 5 



For if we have become [^b]united with _Him_ in the likeness of His death, certainly we shall also be [^c]_in the likeness_ of His resurrection, 







###### 6 



knowing this, that our old [^d]self was crucified with _Him_, in order that our body of sin might be [^e]done away with, so that we would no longer be slaves to sin; 







###### 7 



for the one who has died is [^f]freed from sin. 







###### 8 



Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him, 







###### 9 



knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, [^g]is never to die again; death no longer is master over Him. 







###### 10 



For [^h]the death that He died, He died to sin once for all _time_; but [^i]the life that He lives, He lives to [^j]God. 







###### 11 



So you too, consider yourselves to be dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus. 







###### 12 



Therefore sin is not to reign in your mortal body so that you obey its lusts, 







###### 13 



and do not go on presenting [^k]the parts of your body to sin _as_ [^l]instruments of unrighteousness; but present yourselves to God as those who are alive from the dead, and [^m]your body's parts _as_ [^n]instruments of righteousness for God. 







###### 14 



For sin shall not be master over you, for you are not under [^o]the Law but under grace. 







###### 15 



What then? Are we to sin because we are not under [^p]the Law but under grace? [^q]Far from it! 







###### 16 



Do you not know that _the one_ to whom you present yourselves _as_ slaves for obedience, you are slaves of _that same one_ whom you obey, either of sin [^r]resulting in death, or of obedience [^s]resulting in righteousness? 







###### 17 



But thanks be to God that [^t]though you were slaves of sin, you became obedient from the heart to _that_ [^u]form of teaching to which you were entrusted, 







###### 18 



and after being freed from sin, you became slaves to righteousness. 







###### 19 



I am speaking [^v]in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you presented [^w]the parts of your body as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness, [^x]resulting in _further_ lawlessness, so now present [^y]your body's parts as slaves to righteousness, [^z]resulting in sanctification. 







###### 20 



For when you were slaves of sin, you were free in relation to righteousness. 







###### 21 



Therefore what [^aa]benefit were you then [^ab]deriving from the things of which you are now ashamed? For the outcome of those things is death. 







###### 22 



But now having been freed from sin and enslaved to God, you [^ac]derive your [^ad]benefit, [^ae]resulting in sanctification, and the outcome, eternal life. 







###### 23 



For the wages of sin is death, but the gracious gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

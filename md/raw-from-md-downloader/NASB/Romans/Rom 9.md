# Romans 9

***








###### 1 



I am telling the truth in Christ, I am not lying; my conscience testifies with me in the Holy Spirit, 







###### 2 



that I have great sorrow and unceasing grief in my heart. 







###### 3 



For I could [^a]wish that I myself were accursed, _separated_ from Christ for the sake of my countrymen, my kinsmen according to the flesh, 







###### 4 



who are Israelites, to whom belongs the adoption as sons _and daughters_, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the Law, the _temple_ service, and the promises; 







###### 5 



whose are the fathers, and from whom is the [^b]Christ according to the flesh, who is over all, God blessed [^c]forever. Amen. 







###### 6 



But _it is_ not as though the word of God has failed. For they are not all Israel who are _descended_ from Israel; 







###### 7 



nor are they all children because they are Abraham's [^d]descendants, but: "[^e]through Isaac your [^f]descendants shall be named." 







###### 8 



That is, it is not the children of the flesh [^g]who are children of God, but the children of the promise are regarded as [^h]descendants. 







###### 9 



For this is the word of promise: "At this time I will come, and Sarah will have a son." 







###### 10 



And not only _that_, but there was also Rebekah, when she had conceived _twins_ by one man, our father Isaac; 







###### 11 



for though _the twins_ were not yet born and had not done anything good or bad, so that God's purpose according to _His_ choice would [^i]stand, not [^j]because of works but [^k]because of Him who calls, 







###### 12 



it was said to her, "The older will serve the younger." 







###### 13 



Just as it is written: "Jacob I have loved, but Esau I have hated." 







###### 14 



What shall we say then? There is no injustice with God, is there? [^l]Far from it! 







###### 15 



For He says to Moses, "I will have mercy on whomever I have mercy, and I will show compassion to whomever I show compassion." 







###### 16 



So then, _it does_ not _depend_ on the _person_ who [^m]wants _it_ nor the one who [^n]runs, but on God who has mercy. 







###### 17 



For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, "For this very reason I raised you up, in order to demonstrate My power in you, and that My name might be proclaimed [^o]throughout the earth." 







###### 18 



So then He has mercy on whom He desires, and He hardens whom He desires. 







###### 19 



You will say to me then, "Why does He still find fault? For who has resisted His will?" 







###### 20 



On the contrary, who are you, [^p]you _foolish_ person, who answers back to God? The thing molded will not say to the molder, "Why did you make me like this," will it? 







###### 21 



Or does the potter not have a right over the clay, to make from the same lump one object [^q]for honorable use, and another [^r]for common use? 







###### 22 



[^s]What if God, although willing to demonstrate His wrath and to make His power known, endured with great patience objects of wrath prepared for destruction? 







###### 23 



And _He did so_ to make known the riches of His glory upon objects of mercy, which He prepared beforehand for glory, 







###### 24 



_namely_ us, whom He also called, not only from among Jews, but also from among Gentiles, 







###### 25 



as He also says in Hosea: "I will call those who were not My people, 'My people,' And her who was not beloved, 'beloved.'" 







###### 26 



"And it shall be that in the place where it was said to them, 'you are not My people,' There they shall be called sons of the living God." 







###### 27 



Isaiah cries out concerning Israel, "Though the number of the sons of Israel may be like the sand of the sea, _only_ the remnant will be saved; 







###### 28 



for the Lord will execute His word on the earth, [^t]thoroughly and [^u]quickly." 







###### 29 



And just as Isaiah foretold: "If the Lord [^v]of armies had not left us [^w]descendants, We would have become like Sodom, and would have [^x]been like Gomorrah." 







###### 30 



What shall we say then? That Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, attained righteousness, but the righteousness that is [^y]by faith; 







###### 31 



however, Israel, pursuing a law of righteousness, did not arrive at _that_ law. 







###### 32 



Why? Because _they did_ not _pursue it_ [^z]by faith, but as though _they could_ [^aa]by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone, 







###### 33 



just as it is written: "Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense, And the one who believes in Him will not be [^ab]put to shame." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

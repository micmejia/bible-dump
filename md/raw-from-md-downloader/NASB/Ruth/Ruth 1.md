# Ruth 1

***








###### 1 



Now it came about in the days when the judges [^a]governed, that there was a famine in the land. And a man of Bethlehem in Judah went to reside in the land of Moab [^b]with his wife and his two sons. 







###### 2 



The name of the man _was_ Elimelech, and the name of his wife, Naomi; and the names of his two sons _were_ Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem in Judah. So they entered the land of Moab and remained there. 







###### 3 



Then Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died; and she was left with her two sons. 







###### 4 



And they took for themselves Moabite women _as_ wives; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other, Ruth. And they lived there about ten years. 







###### 5 



Then [^c]both Mahlon and Chilion also died, and the woman was left without her two sons and her husband. 







###### 6 



Then she arose with her daughters-in-law to return from the land of Moab, because she had heard in the land of Moab that the LORD had visited His people by giving them food. 







###### 7 



So she departed from the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah. 







###### 8 



But Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, "Go, return each of you to [^d]your mother's house. May the LORD deal kindly with you as you have dealt with the dead and with me. 







###### 9 



May the LORD grant that you may find a place of rest, each one in the house of her husband." Then she kissed them, and they raised their voices and wept. 







###### 10 



However, they said to her, "_No_, but we will return with you to your people." 







###### 11 



But Naomi said, "Return, my daughters. Why should you go with me? Do I still have sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands? 







###### 12 



Return, my daughters! Go, for I am too old to have a husband. If I said I have hope, if I were even to have a husband tonight and also give birth to sons, 







###### 13 



would you therefore wait until they were grown? Would you therefore refrain from marrying? No, my daughters; for it is much more bitter for me than for you, because the hand of the LORD has come out against me." ## Ruth's Loyalty 







###### 14 



And they raised their voices and wept again; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her. 







###### 15 



Then she said, "Behold, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and her gods; return after your sister-in-law." 







###### 16 



But Ruth said, "Do not plead with me to leave you _or_ to turn back from following you; for where you go, I will go, and where you sleep, I will sleep. Your people _shall be_ my people, and your God, my God. 







###### 17 



Where you die, I will die, and there I will be buried. May the LORD do so to me, and worse, if _anything but_ death separates [^e]me from you." 







###### 18 



When she saw that she was determined to go with her, she stopped speaking to her _about it_. 







###### 19 



So they both went on until they came to Bethlehem. And when they had come to Bethlehem, all the city was stirred because of them, and [^f]the women said, "Is this Naomi?" 







###### 20 



But she said to them, "Do not call me [^g]Naomi; call me [^h]Mara, for [^i]the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me. 







###### 21 



I went _away_ full, but the LORD has brought me back empty. Why do you call me Naomi, since the LORD has testified against me and [^j]the Almighty has afflicted me?" 







###### 22 



So Naomi returned, and with her Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, who returned from the land of Moab. And they came to Bethlehem at the beginning of barley harvest. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

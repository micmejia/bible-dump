# Ruth 4

***








###### 1 



Now Boaz went up to the gate and sat down there, and behold, the redeemer of whom Boaz spoke was passing by, so he said, "Come over here, [^a]friend, sit down here." And he came over and sat down. 







###### 2 



Then he took ten men of the elders of the city and said, "Sit down here." So they sat down. 







###### 3 



And he said to the redeemer, "Naomi, who has returned from the land of Moab, has to sell the plot of land which belonged to our brother Elimelech. 







###### 4 



So I thought that I would [^b]inform you, saying, 'Buy _it_ before those who are sitting _here_, and before the elders of my people. If you will redeem _it_, redeem _it_; but if [^c]not, tell me so that I may know; for there is no one except you to redeem _it_, and I am after you.'" And he said, "I will redeem _it_." 







###### 5 



Then Boaz said, "On the day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi, you must also acquire Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of the deceased, in order to raise up the name of the deceased on his inheritance." 







###### 6 



Then the redeemer said, "I cannot redeem _it_ for myself, otherwise I would [^d]jeopardize my own inheritance. Redeem _it_ for yourself; you _may have_ my right of redemption, since I cannot redeem _it_." 







###### 7 



Now this was _the custom_ in former times in Israel concerning the redemption and the exchange _of land_ to confirm any matter: a man removed his sandal and gave _it_ to another; and this was the _way of_ confirmation in Israel. 







###### 8 



So the redeemer said to Boaz, "Buy _it_ for yourself." And he removed his sandal. 







###### 9 



Then Boaz said to the elders and all the people, "You are witnesses today that I have bought from the hand of Naomi all that belonged to Elimelech and all that belonged to Chilion and Mahlon. 







###### 10 



Furthermore, I have acquired Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of Mahlon, to be my wife in order to raise up the name of the deceased on his inheritance, so that the name of the deceased will not be eliminated from his brothers or from the [^e]court of his _birth_ place; you are witnesses today." 







###### 11 



And all the people who were [^f]in the court, and the elders, said, "_We are_ witnesses. May the LORD make the woman who is coming into your home like Rachel and Leah, both of whom built the house of Israel; and may you achieve [^g]wealth in Ephrathah and [^h]become famous in Bethlehem. 







###### 12 



Moreover, may your house be like the house of Perez whom Tamar bore to Judah, through the [^i]descendants whom the LORD will give you by this young woman." 







###### 13 



So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife, and he had relations with her. And the LORD [^j]enabled her to conceive, and she gave birth to a son. 







###### 14 



Then the women said to Naomi, "Blessed is the LORD who has not left you without a redeemer today, and may his name [^k]become famous in Israel. 







###### 15 



May he also be to you one who restores life and sustains your old age; for your daughter-in-law, who loves you [^l]and is better to you than seven sons, has given birth to him." ## The Line of David 







###### 16 



Then Naomi took the child and [^m]laid him in her lap, and became his nurse. 







###### 17 



And the neighbor women gave him a name, saying, "A son has been born to Naomi!" So they named him Obed. He is the father of Jesse, the father of David. 







###### 18 



Now these are the generations of Perez: Perez fathered Hezron, 







###### 19 



Hezron fathered Ram, and Ram fathered Amminadab, 







###### 20 



and Amminadab fathered Nahshon, and Nahshon fathered Salmon, 







###### 21 



and Salmon fathered Boaz, and Boaz fathered Obed, 







###### 22 



and Obed fathered Jesse, and Jesse fathered David. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Song of Solomon 1

***








###### 1 



The [^a]Song of Songs, which is Solomon's. 







###### 2 



"May he kiss me with the kisses of his mouth! For your love is [^c]sweeter than wine. 







###### 3 



Your oils have a pleasing fragrance, Your name is _like_ [^d]purified oil; Therefore the [^e]young women love you. 







###### 4 



Draw me after you _and_ let's run _together_! The king has brought me into his chambers." "We will rejoice in you and be joyful; We will praise your love more than wine. Rightly do they love you." 







###### 5 



"I am black and beautiful, You daughters of Jerusalem, Like the tents of Kedar, Like the curtains of Solomon. 







###### 6 



Do not stare at me because I am [^f]dark, For the sun has tanned me. My mother's sons were angry with me; They made me caretaker of the vineyards, _But_ I have not taken care of my own vineyard. 







###### 7 



Tell me, you whom my soul loves, Where do you pasture _your flock_, Where do you have _it_ lie down at noon? For why should I be like one who [^g]veils herself Beside the flocks of your companions?" ## Solomon, the Lover, Speaks 







###### 8 



"If you yourself do not know, Most beautiful among women, Go out on the trail of the flock, And pasture your young goats By the tents of the shepherds. 







###### 9 



"[^h]To me, my darling, you are like My mare among the chariots of Pharaoh. 







###### 10 



Your cheeks are delightful with jewelry, Your neck with strings of beads." 







###### 11 



"We will make for you jewelry of gold With beads of silver." 







###### 12 



"While the king was at his table, My [^i]perfume gave forth its fragrance. 







###### 13 



My beloved is to me a pouch of myrrh Which lies all night between my breasts. 







###### 14 



My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms In the vineyards of Engedi." 







###### 15 



"[^j]How beautiful you are, my darling, [^k]How beautiful you are! Your eyes are _like_ doves." 







###### 16 



"[^l]How handsome you are, my beloved, _And_ so delightful! Indeed, our bed is luxuriant!

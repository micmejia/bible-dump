# Song of Solomon 2

***








###### 1 



"I am the [^a]rose of Sharon, The lily of the valleys." 







###### 2 



"Like a lily among the thorns, So is my darling among the [^b]young women." 







###### 3 



"Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest, So is my beloved among the [^c]young men. In his shade I took great delight and sat down, And his fruit was sweet to my [^d]taste. 







###### 4 



He has brought me to _his_ [^e]banquet hall, And his banner over me is love. 







###### 5 



Refresh me with raisin cakes, Sustain me with apples, Because I am lovesick. 







###### 6 



His left hand is under my head, And his right hand embraces me." 







###### 7 



"Swear to me, you daughters of Jerusalem, By the gazelles or by the does of the field, That you will not disturb or awaken _my_ love Until she pleases." 







###### 8 



"Listen! My beloved! Behold, he is coming, Leaping on the mountains, Jumping on the hills! 







###### 9 



My beloved is like a gazelle or a young [^f]stag. Behold, he is standing behind our wall, He is looking through the windows, He is peering through the lattice. 







###### 10 



"My beloved responded and said to me, 'Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, And come along. 







###### 11 



For behold, the winter is past, The rain is over _and_ gone. 







###### 12 



The blossoms have _already_ appeared in the land; The time has arrived for [^g]pruning _the vines_, And the voice of the turtledove has been heard in our land. 







###### 13 



The fig tree has ripened its fruit, And the vines in blossom have given forth _their_ fragrance. Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, And come along!'" 







###### 14 



"My dove, in the clefts of the [^h]rock, In the hiding place of the mountain pathway, Let me see [^i]how you look, Let me hear your voice; For your voice is pleasant, And [^j]you look delightful." 







###### 15 



"Catch the [^k]foxes for us, The [^l]little [^m]foxes that are ruining the vineyards, While our vineyards are in blossom." 







###### 16 



"My beloved is mine, and I am his; He pastures _his flock_ among the lilies. 







###### 17 



Until the cool of the day, when the shadows flee, Turn, my beloved, and be like a gazelle Or a young stag on the mountains of [^n]Bether." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

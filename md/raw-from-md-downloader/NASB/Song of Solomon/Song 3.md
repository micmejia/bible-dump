# Song of Solomon 3

***








###### 1 



"On my bed night after night I sought him Whom my soul loves; I sought him but did not find him. 







###### 2 



'[^a]I must arise now and [^b]go around in the city; In the streets and in the public squares [^c]I must seek him whom my soul loves.' I sought him but did not find him. 







###### 3 



The watchmen who make the rounds in the city found me, _And I said_, 'Have you seen him whom my soul loves?' 







###### 4 



Hardly had I [^d]left them When I found him whom my soul loves; I held on to him and would not let him go Until I had brought him to my mother's house, And into the room of her who conceived me." 







###### 5 



"Swear to me, you daughters of Jerusalem, By the gazelles or by the does of the field, That you will not disturb or awaken _my_ love Until she pleases." ## Solomon's Wedding Day 







###### 6 



"[^e]What is this coming up from the wilderness Like columns of smoke, Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, With all the scented powders of the merchant? 







###### 7 



Behold, it is [^f]the _traveling_ couch of Solomon; Sixty warriors around it, Of the warriors of Israel. 







###### 8 



All of them are wielders of the sword, Expert in war; Each man has his sword at his side, _Guarding_ against the [^g]terrors of the night. 







###### 9 



King Solomon has made for himself a [^h]sedan chair From the timber of Lebanon. 







###### 10 



He made its posts of silver, Its [^i]back of gold _And_ its seat of purple fabric, _With_ its interior lovingly inlaid By the daughters of Jerusalem. 







###### 11 



Go out, you daughters of Zion, And look at King Solomon with the [^j]crown With which his mother has crowned him On the day of his wedding, And on the day of the joy of his heart." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

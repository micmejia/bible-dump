# Song of Solomon 4

***








###### 1 



"[^a]How beautiful you are, my darling, [^b]How beautiful you are! Your eyes are _like_ doves behind your veil; Your hair is like a flock of goats That have descended from Mount Gilead. 







###### 2 



Your teeth are like a flock of _newly_ shorn _sheep_ Which have come up from _their_ watering place, All of which bear twins, And not one among them has lost her young. 







###### 3 



Your lips are like a scarlet thread, And your mouth is beautiful. Your temples are like a slice of a pomegranate Behind your veil. 







###### 4 



Your neck is like the tower of David, Built with layers of stones On which are hung a thousand shields, All the round shields of the warriors. 







###### 5 



Your two breasts are like two fawns, Twins of a gazelle That graze among the lilies. 







###### 6 



Until [^c]the cool of the day When the shadows flee, I will go my way to the mountain of myrrh And to the hill of frankincense. 







###### 7 



"You are altogether beautiful, my darling, And there is no blemish on you. 







###### 8 



_Come_ with me from Lebanon, _my_ bride, You shall come with me from Lebanon. You shall [^d]come down from the summit of Amana, From the summit of Senir and Hermon, From the dens of lions, From the mountains of leopards. 







###### 9 



You have [^e]enchanted my heart, my sister, _my_ bride; You have [^f]enchanted my heart with a single _glance_ of your eyes, With a single strand of your necklace. 







###### 10 



How beautiful is your love, my sister, _my_ bride! How much [^g]sweeter is your love than wine, And the fragrance of your oils Than _that of_ all _kinds of_ balsam oils! 







###### 11 



Your lips drip honey, _my_ bride; Honey and milk are under your tongue, And the fragrance of your garments is like the fragrance of Lebanon. 







###### 12 



A locked garden is my sister, _my_ bride, A locked spring, a sealed fountain. 







###### 13 



Your branches are an [^h]orchard of pomegranates With delicious fruits, henna with nard plants, 







###### 14 



Nard and saffron, spice reed and cinnamon, With all the trees of frankincense, Myrrh, and aloes, along with all the finest balsam oils. 







###### 15 



_You are_ a garden spring, A well of [^i]fresh water, And flowing _streams_ from Lebanon." 







###### 16 



"Awake, north _wind_, And come, _wind of_ the south; [^j]Make my garden breathe out _fragrance_, May its balsam oils flow. May my beloved come into his garden And eat its delicious fruits!" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Song of Solomon 5

***








###### 1 



"I have come into my garden, my sister, _my_ bride; I have gathered my myrrh along with my balsam. I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, friends; Drink and [^a]drink deeply, lovers." 







###### 2 



"I was asleep but my heart was awake. A voice! My beloved was knocking: 'Open to me, my sister, my darling, My dove, my perfect one! For my head is [^b]drenched with dew, My locks with the dew drops of the night.' 







###### 3 



I have taken off my dress, How can I put it on _again_? I have washed my feet, How can I dirty them _again_? 







###### 4 



My beloved extended his hand through the opening, And my feelings were stirred for him. 







###### 5 



I arose to open to my beloved; And my hands dripped with myrrh, And my fingers with drops of myrrh, On the handles of the bolt. 







###### 6 



I opened to my beloved, But my beloved had turned away _and_ had gone! My [^c]heart went out _to him_ as he spoke. I searched for him but I did not find him; I called him but he did not answer me. 







###### 7 



The watchmen who make the rounds in the city found me, They struck me _and_ wounded me; The guards of the walls took my shawl away from me. 







###### 8 



Swear to me, you daughters of Jerusalem, If you find my beloved, As to what you will tell him: For I am lovesick." 







###### 9 



"[^d]What kind of beloved is your beloved, O most beautiful among women? [^e]What kind of beloved is your beloved, That you make us swear in this way?" ## Admiration by the Bride 







###### 10 



"My beloved is dazzling and [^f]reddish, Outstanding among ten thousand. 







###### 11 



His head is _like_ gold, pure gold; His locks are _like_ clusters of dates _And_ black as a raven. 







###### 12 



His eyes are like doves Beside streams of water, Bathed in milk, _And_ perched in _their_ setting. 







###### 13 



His cheeks are like a bed of balsam, [^g]Banks of herbal spices; His lips are lilies Dripping with drops of myrrh. 







###### 14 



His hands are rods of gold Set with topaz; His abdomen is panels of ivory Covered with [^h]sapphires. 







###### 15 



His thighs are pillars of alabaster Set on pedestals of pure gold; His appearance is like Lebanon, Choice as the cedars. 







###### 16 



His [^i]mouth is _full of_ sweetness. And he is wholly desirable. This is my beloved and this is my friend, You daughters of Jerusalem." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

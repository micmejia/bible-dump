# Song of Solomon 7

***








###### 1 



"[^a]How beautiful are your feet in sandals, [^b]Prince's daughter! The curves of your hips are like jewels, The work of the hands of an artist. 







###### 2 



Your navel is _like_ a round goblet _That_ never lacks mixed wine; Your belly is _like_ a heap of wheat, [^c]Surrounded with lilies. 







###### 3 



Your two breasts are like two fawns, Twins of a gazelle. 







###### 4 



Your neck is like a tower of ivory, Your eyes _like the_ pools in Heshbon By the gate of Bath-rabbim; Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon, Which looks toward Damascus. 







###### 5 



Your head [^d]crowns you like Carmel, And the flowing hair of your head is like purple threads; _The_ king is captivated by _your_ tresses. 







###### 6 



How beautiful and how delightful you are, [^e]_My_ love, with _all_ your delights! 







###### 7 



[^f]Your stature is like a palm tree, And your breasts are _like its_ clusters. 







###### 8 



I said, 'I will climb the palm tree, I will grasp its fruit stalks.' Oh, may your breasts be like clusters of the vine, And the fragrance of your [^g]breath like apples, 







###### 9 



And your [^h]mouth like the best wine!" "It goes _down_ smoothly for my beloved, Flowing gently _through_ the lips of those who are asleep. ## The Union of Love 







###### 10 



"I am my beloved's, And his desire is for me. 







###### 11 



Come, my beloved, let's go out to the [^i]country, Let's spend the night in the villages. 







###### 12 



Let's rise early _and go_ to the vineyards; Let's see whether the vine has grown _And its_ buds have opened, _And whether_ the pomegranates have bloomed. There I will give you my love. 







###### 13 



The mandrakes have given forth fragrance; And over our doors are all delicious _fruits_, New as well as old, _Which_ I have saved for you, my beloved. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Song of Solomon 8

***








###### 1 



"Oh that you were like a brother to me Who nursed at my mother's breasts. _If_ I found you outdoors, I would kiss you; No one would despise me, either. 







###### 2 



I would lead you _and_ bring you Into the house of my mother, who used to instruct me; I would give you spiced wine to drink from the juice of my pomegranates. 







###### 3 



_Let_ his left hand _be_ under my head, And his right hand embrace me." 







###### 4 



"Swear to me, you daughters of Jerusalem: [^a]Do not disturb or awaken _my_ love Until she pleases." 







###### 5 



"Who is this coming up from the wilderness, Leaning on her beloved?" "Beneath the apple tree I awakened you; There your mother went into labor with you, There she was in labor _and_ gave birth to you. 







###### 6 



Put me like a seal over your heart, Like a seal on your arm. For love is as strong as death, [^b]Jealousy is as severe as Sheol; Its flames are flames of fire, [^c]The flame of the LORD. 







###### 7 



Many waters cannot quench love, Nor will rivers flood over it; If a man were to give all the riches of his house for love, It would be utterly despised." 







###### 8 



"We have a little sister, And she has no breasts; What shall we do for our sister On the day when she is spoken for? 







###### 9 



If she is a wall, We will build on her a battlement of silver; But if she is a door, We will barricade her with planks of cedar." 







###### 10 



"I was a wall, and my breasts were like towers; Then I became in his eyes as one who finds peace. 







###### 11 



Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; He entrusted the vineyard to caretakers. Each one was to bring a thousand _shekels_ of silver for its fruit. 







###### 12 



My very own vineyard is [^d]at my disposal; The thousand _shekels_ are for you, Solomon, And two hundred are for those who take care of its fruit." 







###### 13 



"You who sit in the gardens: _My_ companions are listening for your voice-- Let me hear it!" 







###### 14 



"[^e]Hurry, my beloved, And be like a gazelle or a young [^f]stag On the mountains of balsam trees!" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Titus 1

***








###### 1 



Paul, a bond-servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, [^a]for the faith of those chosen of God and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness, 







###### 2 



in the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised [^b]long ages ago, 







###### 3 



but at the proper time revealed His word in the proclamation with which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God our Savior; 







###### 4 



To Titus, my true [^c]son [^d]in a common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior. ## Qualifications of Elders 







###### 5 



For this reason I left you in Crete, that you would set in order what remains and appoint elders in every city as I directed you, 







###### 6 



_namely_, if any man is beyond reproach, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, not accused of indecent behavior or rebellion. 







###### 7 



For the [^e]overseer must be beyond reproach as God's steward, not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not overindulging in wine, not [^f]a bully, not greedy for money, 







###### 8 



but hospitable, loving what is good, self-controlled, righteous, holy, disciplined, 







###### 9 



holding firmly the faithful word which is in accordance with the teaching, so that he will be able both to [^g]exhort in sound doctrine and to refute those who contradict _it_. 







###### 10 



For there are many rebellious people, empty talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision, 







###### 11 



who must be silenced because they are upsetting whole families, teaching things they should not _teach_ for the sake of [^h]dishonest gain. 







###### 12 



One of them, a prophet of their own, said, "Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons." 







###### 13 



This testimony is true. For this reason reprimand them severely so that they may be sound in the faith, 







###### 14 



not paying attention to Jewish myths and commandments of men who turn away from the truth. 







###### 15 



To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure, but both their mind and their conscience are defiled. 







###### 16 



They profess to know God, but by _their_ deeds they deny _Him_, being detestable and disobedient and worthless for any good deed. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

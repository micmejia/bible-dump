# Titus 2

***








###### 1 



But _as for_ you, proclaim the things which are fitting for sound doctrine. 







###### 2 



Older men are to be [^a]temperate, dignified, self-controlled, sound in faith, in love, in [^b]perseverance. 







###### 3 



Older women likewise _are to be_ reverent in their behavior, not malicious gossips nor enslaved to much wine, teaching what is good, 







###### 4 



so that they may [^c]encourage the young women to love their husbands, to love their children, 







###### 5 



_to be_ sensible, pure, workers at home, kind, being subject to their own husbands, so that the word of God will not be dishonored. 







###### 6 



Likewise urge the young men to be [^d]sensible; 







###### 7 



in all things show yourself _to be_ an example of good deeds, _with_ [^e]purity in doctrine, dignified, 







###### 8 



sound _in_ speech which is beyond reproach, so that the opponent will be put to shame, having nothing bad to say about us. 







###### 9 



_Urge_ [^f]slaves to be subject to their own masters in everything, to be pleasing, not [^g]argumentative, 







###### 10 



not stealing, but showing all good faith so that they will adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in every respect. 







###### 11 



For the grace of God has appeared, [^h]bringing salvation to all people, 







###### 12 



[^i]instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires and to live sensibly, righteously, and in a godly manner in the present age, 







###### 13 



looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of [^j]our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus, 







###### 14 



who gave Himself for us to redeem us from every lawless deed, and to purify for Himself a people for His own possession, eager for good deeds. 







###### 15

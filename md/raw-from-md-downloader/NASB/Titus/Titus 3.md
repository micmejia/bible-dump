# Titus 3

***








###### 1 



Remind them to be subject to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good deed, 







###### 2 



to slander no one, not to be contentious, _to be_ gentle, showing every consideration for all people. 







###### 3 



For we too were once foolish, disobedient, deceived, enslaved to various lusts and pleasures, spending our life in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another. 







###### 4 



But when the kindness of God our Savior and _His_ love for mankind appeared, 







###### 5 



He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we did in righteousness, but in accordance with His mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit, 







###### 6 



whom He richly poured out upon us through Jesus Christ our Savior, 







###### 7 



so that being justified by His grace we would be made heirs [^a]according to _the_ hope of eternal life. 







###### 8 



This statement is trustworthy; and concerning these things I want you to speak confidently, so that those who have believed God will be careful to engage in good deeds. These things are good and beneficial for people. 







###### 9 



But avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and strife and disputes about the Law, for they are useless and worthless. 







###### 10 



Reject a [^b]divisive person after a first and second warning, 







###### 11 



knowing that such a person has deviated from what is right and is sinning, being self-condemned. ## Personal Concerns 







###### 12 



When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, make every effort to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there. 







###### 13 



Diligently help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way so that nothing is lacking for them. 







###### 14 



Our people must also learn to engage in good [^c]deeds to meet pressing needs, so that they will not be unproductive. 







###### 15 



All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in _the_ faith. Grace be with you all. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

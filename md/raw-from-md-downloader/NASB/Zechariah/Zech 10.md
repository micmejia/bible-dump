# Zechariah 10

***








###### 1 



Ask for rain from the LORD at the time of the spring rain-- The LORD who makes the [^a]storm winds; And He will give them showers of rain, vegetation in the field to _each_ person. 







###### 2 



For the [^b]household idols speak deception, And the diviners see [^c]an illusion And tell deceitful dreams; They comfort in vain. Therefore _the people_ [^d]wander like sheep, They are wretched because there is no shepherd. 







###### 3 



"My anger is kindled against the shepherds, And I will punish the [^e]male goats; For the LORD of armies has visited His flock, the house of Judah, And will make them like His majestic horse in battle. 







###### 4 



From [^f]them will come the cornerstone, From [^g]them the tent peg, From [^h]them the bow of battle, From [^i]them every tyrant, _all of them_ together. 







###### 5 



And they will be like warriors, Trampling down _the enemy_ in the mud of the streets in battle; And they will fight, because the LORD _will be_ with them; And the riders on horses will be put to shame. 







###### 6 



And I will strengthen the house of Judah, And I will save the house of Joseph, And I will [^j]bring them back, Because I have had compassion on them; And they will be as though I had not rejected them, For I am the LORD their God and I will answer them. 







###### 7 



Ephraim will be like a warrior, And their heart will be joyful as if _from_ wine; Indeed, their children will see _it_ and be joyful, [^k]Their heart will rejoice in the LORD. 







###### 8 



I will whistle for them and gather them together, For I have redeemed them; And they will be as numerous as they [^l]were before. 







###### 9 



When I [^m]scatter them among the peoples, They will remember Me in distant countries, And they with their children will live and come back. 







###### 10 



I will bring them back from the land of Egypt And gather them from Assyria; And I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon [^n]Until no _room_ can be found for them. 







###### 11 



And they will pass through the sea of distress And He will strike the waves in the sea, So that all the depths of the Nile will dry up; And the pride of Assyria will be brought down, And the scepter of Egypt will depart. 







###### 12 



And I will strengthen them in the LORD, And in His name they will walk," declares the LORD. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

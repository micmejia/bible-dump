# Zechariah 11

***








###### 1 



Open your doors, Lebanon, So that a fire may feed on your cedars. 







###### 2 



Wail, juniper, because the cedar has fallen, For the magnificent _trees_ have been destroyed; Wail, oaks of Bashan, Because the [^a]impenetrable forest has come down. 







###### 3 



There is a sound of the shepherds' wail, For their splendor is ruined; There is a sound of the young lions' roar, For the [^b]pride of the Jordan is ruined. 







###### 4 



This is what the LORD my God says: "Pasture the flock _doomed_ to slaughter. 







###### 5 



Those who buy them slaughter them and [^c]go unpunished, and _each of_ those who sell them says, 'Blessed be the LORD, for I have become rich!' And their own shepherds have no compassion for them. 







###### 6 



For I will no longer have compassion for the inhabitants of the land," declares the LORD; "but behold, I will let the people fall, each into another's [^d]power and into the [^e]power of his king; and they will crush the land, and I will not rescue _them_ from their [^f]power." 







###### 7 



So I pastured the flock _doomed_ to slaughter, [^g]therefore _also_ the afflicted of the flock. And I took for myself two staffs: the one I called [^h]Favor, and the other I called Union; so I pastured the flock. 







###### 8 



Then I did away with the three shepherds in one month, for my soul was impatient with them, and their soul also [^i]was tired of me. 







###### 9 



Then I said, "I will not pasture you. What is to die, [^j]let it die, and what is to perish, [^k]let it perish; and [^l]let those who are left eat one another's flesh." 







###### 10 



And I took my staff [^m]Favor and cut it in pieces, to [^n]break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples. 







###### 11 



So it was [^o]broken on that day, and [^p]so the afflicted of the flock who were watching me realized that it was the word of the LORD. 







###### 12 



And I said to them, "If it is good in your sight, give _me_ my wages; but if not, [^q]never mind!" So they weighed out thirty _shekels_ of silver as my wages. 







###### 13 



Then the LORD said to me, "Throw it to the potter, _that_ magnificent price at which I was valued by them." So I took the thirty _shekels_ of silver and threw them to the potter _in_ the house of the LORD. 







###### 14 



Then I cut in pieces my second staff Union, to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel. 







###### 15 



And the LORD said to me, "Take again for yourself the equipment of a foolish shepherd. 







###### 16 



For behold, I am going to raise up a shepherd in the land who will not care for the perishing, seek the scattered, heal the broken, _or_ provide for the one who is exhausted, but will devour the flesh of the fat _sheep_ and tear off their hoofs. 







###### 17 



Woe to the worthless shepherd Who abandons the flock! A sword will be on his arm And on his right eye! His arm will be totally withered, And his right eye will be [^r]blind." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

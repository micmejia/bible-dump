# Zechariah 2

***








###### 1 



[^a]Then I raised my eyes and looked, and behold, _there was_ a man with a measuring line in his hand. 







###### 2 



So I said, "Where are you going?" And he said to me, "To measure Jerusalem, to see how wide it is and how long it is." 







###### 3 



And behold, the angel who had been speaking with me was going out, and another angel was going out to meet him. 







###### 4 



And he said to him, "Run, speak to that young man there, saying, 'Jerusalem will be inhabited as open country because of the multitude of people and cattle within it. 







###### 5 



But I,' declares the LORD, 'will be a wall of fire to her on all sides, and I will be the glory in her midst.'" 







###### 6 



"[^b]You there! Flee from the land of the north," declares the LORD, "because I have spread you out like the four winds of the heavens," declares the LORD. 







###### 7 



"[^c]You, Zion! Escape, you who are living _with_ the daughter of Babylon." 







###### 8 



For the LORD of armies says this: "After glory He has sent me against the nations that plunder you, for the one who touches you, touches the [^d]apple of His eye. 







###### 9 



For behold, I am going to wave My hand over them so that they will be plunder for their slaves. Then you will know that the LORD of armies has sent Me. 







###### 10 



Shout for joy and rejoice, daughter of Zion; for behold I am coming and I will dwell in your midst," declares the LORD. 







###### 11 



"And many nations will join themselves to the LORD on that day and will become My people. Then I will dwell in your midst, and you will know that the LORD of armies has sent Me to you. 







###### 12 



And the LORD will [^e]possess Judah as His portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem. 







###### 13 



"[^f]Be silent, all [^g]mankind, before the LORD; for He has roused Himself from His holy dwelling." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

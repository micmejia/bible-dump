# Zechariah 3

***








###### 1 



Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and [^a]Satan standing at his right to accuse him. 







###### 2 



And the LORD said to Satan, "The LORD rebuke you, Satan! Indeed, the LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is this not a log snatched from the fire?" 







###### 3 



Now Joshua was clothed in filthy garments and was standing before the angel. 







###### 4 



And he responded and said to those who were standing before him, saying, "Remove the filthy garments from him." Again he said to him, "See, I have taken your guilt away from you and [^b]will clothe you with festive robes." 







###### 5 



Then I said, "Have them put a clean headband on his head." So they put the clean headband on his head and clothed him with garments, while the angel of the LORD was standing by. 







###### 6 



And the angel of the LORD admonished Joshua, saying, 







###### 7 



"The LORD of armies says this: 'If you walk in My ways and perform My service, then you will both govern My house and be in charge of My courtyards, and I will grant you [^c]free access among these who are standing _here_. ## The Branch 







###### 8 



Now listen, Joshua, _you_ high priest, you and your friends who are sitting in front of you--indeed they are men who are a sign: for behold, I am going to bring in My servant the [^d]Branch. 







###### 9 



For behold, the stone that I have put before Joshua; on one stone are seven eyes. Behold, I am going to engrave an inscription on it,' declares the LORD of armies, 'and I will remove the guilt of that land in one day. 







###### 10 



On that day,' declares the LORD of armies, 'every one _of you_ will invite his neighbor to _sit_ under _his_ vine and under _his_ fig tree.'" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Zechariah 4

***








###### 1 



Then the angel who had been speaking with me returned and woke me, like a person who is awakened from his sleep. 







###### 2 



And he said to me, "What do you see?" And I said, "I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold with its bowl on the top of it, and its seven lamps on it with seven [^a]spouts _belonging_ to _each of_ the lamps which are on the top of it; 







###### 3 



also two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl and the other on its left side." 







###### 4 



Then I said to the angel who was speaking with me, saying, "What are these, my lord?" 







###### 5 



So the angel who was speaking with me answered and said to me, "Do you not know what these are?" And I said, "No, my lord." 







###### 6 



Then he said to [^b]me, "This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel, saying, 'Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,' says the LORD of armies. 







###### 7 



'What are you, you great mountain? Before Zerubbabel _you will become_ a plain; and he will bring out the top stone _with_ shouts of "Grace, grace to it!"'" 







###### 8 



Also the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 







###### 9 



"The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands will finish _it_. Then you will know that the LORD of armies has sent me to [^c]you. 







###### 10 



For who has shown contempt for the day of small things? [^d]But these seven will rejoice when they see the [^e]plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel--they are the eyes of the LORD roaming throughout the earth." 







###### 11 



Then I said to him, "What are these two olive trees on the right of the lampstand and on its left?" 







###### 12 



And I responded the second time and said to him, "What are the two olive [^f]branches which are beside the two golden pipes, which empty the golden _oil_ from themselves?" 







###### 13 



So he answered me, saying, "Do you not know what these are?" And I said, "No, my lord." 







###### 14 



Then he said, "These are the two [^g]anointed ones, who are standing by the Lord of the whole earth." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Zechariah 6

***








###### 1 



Now I raised my eyes again and looked, and behold, four chariots were going out from between the two mountains; and the mountains _were_ bronze mountains. 







###### 2 



With the first chariot _were_ red horses, with the second chariot black horses, 







###### 3 



with the third chariot white horses, and with the fourth chariot strong spotted horses. 







###### 4 



So I responded and said to the angel who was speaking with me, "What are these, my lord?" 







###### 5 



The angel replied to me, "These are the four spirits of heaven, going out after taking their stand before the Lord of all the earth, 







###### 6 



with one of which the black horses are going out to the north country; and the white ones are to go out after them, while the spotted ones are to go out to the south country." 







###### 7 



When the strong ones went out, they [^a]were eager to go to [^b]patrol the earth. And He said, "Go, [^c]patrol the earth." So they [^d]patrolled the earth. 







###### 8 



Then He called out to me and spoke to me, saying, "See, those who are going to the land of the north have [^e]appeased My wrath in the land of the north." 







###### 9 



The word of the LORD also came to me, saying, 







###### 10 



"Take _an offering_ from the exiles, from Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah; and you shall go the same day and enter the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have arrived from Babylon. ## The Symbolic Crowns 







###### 11 



Also take silver and gold, make an _ornate_ crown, and set _it_ on the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest. 







###### 12 



Then say to him, 'The LORD of armies says this: "Behold, _there is_ a Man whose name is [^f]Branch, for He will [^g]branch out from where He is; and He will build the temple of the LORD. 







###### 13 



Yes, it is He who will build the temple of the LORD, and He who will bear the majesty and sit and rule on His throne. So He will be a priest on His throne, and the counsel of peace will be between the two [^h]offices."' 







###### 14 



Now the crown will become a reminder in the temple of the LORD to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah, and [^i]Hen the son of Zephaniah. 







###### 15 



Those who are far away will come and [^j]build the temple of the LORD." Then you will know that the LORD of armies has sent me to you. And it will take place if you completely obey [^k]the LORD your God. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

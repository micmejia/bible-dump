# Zechariah 7

***








###### 1 



In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah on the fourth _day_ of the ninth month, _which is_ Chislev. 







###### 2 



Now _the town of_ Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regemmelech and [^a]their men to [^b]seek the favor of the LORD, 







###### 3 



speaking to the priests who _belong_ to the house of the LORD of armies, and to the prophets, saying, "Shall I weep in the fifth month [^c]and fast, as I have done these many years?" 







###### 4 



Then the word of the LORD of armies came to me, saying, 







###### 5 



"Say to all the people of the land and to the priests, 'When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh _months_ [^d]these seventy years, was it actually for Me that you fasted? 







###### 6 



And when you eat and drink, [^e]do you not eat for yourselves and drink for yourselves? 







###### 7 



Are _these_ not the words which the LORD proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and carefree along with its cities around it, and the [^f]Negev and the [^g]foothills were inhabited?'" 







###### 8 



Then the word of the LORD came to Zechariah, saying, 







###### 9 



"This is what the LORD of armies has said: 'Dispense true justice and practice kindness and compassion each to his brother; 







###### 10 



and do not oppress the widow or the [^h]orphan, the stranger or the poor; and do not devise evil in your hearts against one another.' 







###### 11 



But they refused to pay attention, and [^i]turned a stubborn shoulder and [^j]plugged their ears from hearing. 







###### 12 



They also made their hearts _as hard as_ a diamond [^k]so that they could not hear the Law and the words which the LORD of armies had sent by His Spirit through the former prophets; therefore great wrath came from the LORD of armies. 







###### 13 



And just as He called and they would not listen, so they called and I would not listen," says the LORD of armies; 







###### 14 



"but I [^l]scattered them with a storm wind among all the nations whom they did not know. So the land was desolated behind them [^m]so that no one went back and forth, since they made the pleasant land desolate." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

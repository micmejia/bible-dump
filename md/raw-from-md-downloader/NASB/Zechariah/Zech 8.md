# Zechariah 8

***








###### 1 



Then the word of the LORD of armies came, saying, 







###### 2 



"The LORD of armies says this: 'I am exceedingly jealous for Zion, yes, with great wrath I am jealous for her.' 







###### 3 



The LORD says this: 'I will return to Zion and dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. Then Jerusalem will be called the City of Truth, and the mountain of the LORD of armies _will be called_ the Holy Mountain.' 







###### 4 



The LORD of armies says this: 'Old men and old women will again sit in the public squares of Jerusalem, each person with his staff in his hand because of [^a]age. 







###### 5 



And the public squares of the city will be filled with boys and girls playing in its squares.' 







###### 6 



The LORD of armies says this: 'If it is too difficult in the sight of the remnant of this people in those days, will it also be too difficult in My sight?' declares the LORD of armies. 







###### 7 



The LORD of armies says this: 'Behold, I am going to save My people from the land of the [^b]east and from the land of the [^c]west; 







###### 8 



and I will bring them _back_ and they will live in the midst of Jerusalem; and they shall be My people, and I will be their God in [^d]truth and righteousness.' 







###### 9 



"The LORD of armies says this: 'Let your hands be strong, you who are listening in these days to these words from the mouth of the prophets, _those_ who _spoke_ in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of armies was laid, so that the temple might be built. 







###### 10 



For before those days there was no wage for man nor any wage for animal; and for him who went out or came in there was no [^e]peace because of [^f]his enemies, and I sent all the people against one another. 







###### 11 



But now I will not [^g]treat the remnant of this people as in the former days,' declares the LORD of armies. 







###### 12 



'For _there will be_ the seed of peace: the vine will yield its fruit, the land will yield its produce, and the heavens will provide their dew; and I will give to the remnant of this people all these _things_ as an inheritance. 







###### 13 



And it will come about that just as you were a curse among the nations, house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you that you may become a blessing. Do not fear; let your hands be strong.' 







###### 14 



"For this is what the LORD of armies says: 'Just as I determined to do harm to you when your fathers provoked Me to anger,' says the LORD of armies, 'and I have not relented, 







###### 15 



so I have again determined in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Do not fear! 







###### 16 



These are the things which you shall do: speak the truth to one another; judge with truth and judgment for peace at your [^h]gates. 







###### 17 



Also let none of you devise evil in your heart against another, and do not love [^i]perjury; for all these _things_ are what I hate,' declares the LORD." 







###### 18 



Then the word of the LORD of armies came to me, saying, 







###### 19 



"The LORD of armies says this: 'The fast of the fourth, the fast of the fifth, the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth _months_ will become joy, jubilation, and [^j]cheerful festivals for the house of Judah; so love truth and peace.' 







###### 20 



"The LORD of armies says this: '_It will_ yet _turn out_ that peoples will come, that is, the inhabitants of many cities. 







###### 21 



The inhabitants of one _city_ will go to another, saying, "Let's go at once to plead for the favor of the LORD, and to seek the LORD of armies; [^k]I also will go." 







###### 22 



So many peoples and mighty nations will come to seek the LORD of armies in Jerusalem, and to plead for the favor of the LORD.' 







###### 23 



The LORD of armies says this: 'In those days ten people from all the [^l]nations will [^m]grasp the [^n]garment of a Jew, saying, "Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you."'" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Zephaniah 2

***








###### 1 



Gather yourselves together, yes, join together, You nation without [^a]shame, 







###### 2 



Before the decree [^b]takes effect-- The day passes like chaff-- Before the burning anger of the LORD comes upon you, Before the day of the LORD's anger comes upon you. 







###### 3 



Seek the LORD, All you humble of the [^c]earth Who have practiced His [^d]ordinances; Seek righteousness, seek humility. Perhaps you will remain hidden On the day of the LORD's anger. 







###### 4 



For Gaza will be abandoned, And Ashkelon _will become_ a desolation; _The inhabitants of_ Ashdod will be driven out at noon, And Ekron will be uprooted. 







###### 5 



Woe to the inhabitants of the seacoast, The nation of the [^e]Cherethites! The word of the LORD is against you, Canaan, land of the Philistines; And I will eliminate you So that there will be no inhabitant. 







###### 6 



So the seacoast will become grazing places, _With_ pastures for shepherds and folds for flocks. 







###### 7 



And the coast will be For the remnant of the house of Judah, They will drive _sheep_ to pasture on it. In the houses of Ashkelon they will lie down at evening; For the LORD their God will care for them And restore their fortunes. 







###### 8 



"I have heard the taunting of Moab And the abusive speech of the sons of Ammon, With which they have taunted My people And boasted against their territory. 







###### 9 



Therefore, as I live," declares the LORD of armies, The God of Israel, "Moab will assuredly be like Sodom, And the sons of Ammon like Gomorrah-- Ground overgrown with weeds and _full of_ salt mines, And a permanent desolation. The remnant of My people will plunder them, And the remainder of My nation will inherit them." 







###### 10 



This they will have in return for their arrogance, because they have taunted and boasted against the people of the LORD of armies. 







###### 11 



The LORD will be terrifying to them, for He will [^f]starve all the gods of the earth; and all the coastlands of the nations will bow down to Him, everyone from his _own_ place. 







###### 12 



"You also, Ethiopians, will be slain by My sword." 







###### 13 



And He will stretch out His hand against the north And eliminate Assyria, And He will make Nineveh a desolation, Parched like the wilderness. 







###### 14 



Flocks will lie down in her midst, [^g]All animals that range in herds; Both the [^h]pelican and the hedgehog Will spend their nights in [^i]the tops of her pillars; [^j]Birds will sing in the window, Devastation _will be_ on the threshold; For He has uncovered the cedar work. 







###### 15 



This is the presumptuous city That dwells securely, Who says in her heart, "I am, and there is no one besides me." How she has become a desolation, A resting place for animals! Everyone who passes by her will [^k]hiss _And_ wave his hand _in contempt_. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

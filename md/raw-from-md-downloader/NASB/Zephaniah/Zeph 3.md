# Zephaniah 3

***








###### 1 



Woe to her who is rebellious and defiled, The oppressive city! 







###### 2 



She obeyed no voice, She accepted no discipline. She did not trust in the LORD, She did not approach her God. 







###### 3 



Her leaders within her are roaring lions, Her judges are wolves at evening; They have no bones to gnaw in the morning. 







###### 4 



Her prophets are insolent, treacherous men; Her priests have profaned the sanctuary. They have done violence to the Law. 







###### 5 



The LORD is righteous within her; He will do no injustice. Every morning He brings His justice to light; He [^a]does not fail. But the [^b]criminal knows no shame. 







###### 6 



"I have eliminated nations; Their corner towers are deserted. I have laid waste their streets, With no one passing by; Their cities have been laid waste, Without a person, without an inhabitant. 







###### 7 



I said, 'You will certainly revere Me, You will accept discipline.' So her dwelling will not be eliminated _In accordance with_ everything that I have stipulated for her. Instead, they were eager to corrupt all their deeds. 







###### 8 



"Therefore wait for Me," declares the LORD, "For the day when I rise up as a witness. Indeed, My decision _is_ to gather nations, To assemble kingdoms, To pour out on them My indignation, All My burning anger; For all the earth will be devoured By the fire of My zeal. 







###### 9 



For then I will [^c]restore to the peoples pure lips, So that all of them may call on the name of the LORD, To serve Him [^d]shoulder to shoulder. 







###### 10 



From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia My worshipers, [^e]My dispersed ones, Will bring My offerings. 







###### 11 



On that day you will feel no shame Because of all your deeds By which you have rebelled against Me; For then I will remove from your midst Your proud, arrogant ones, And you will never again be haughty On My holy mountain. ## A Remnant of Israel 







###### 12 



But I will leave among you A humble and lowly people, And they will take refuge in the name of the LORD. 







###### 13 



The remnant of Israel will do no wrong And tell no lies, Nor will a deceitful tongue Be found in their mouths; For they will feed and lie down With no one to frighten _them_." 







###### 14 



Shout for joy, daughter of Zion! Shout _in triumph_, Israel! Rejoice and triumph with all _your_ heart, Daughter of Jerusalem! 







###### 15 



The LORD has taken away _His_ judgments against you, He has cleared away your enemies. The King of Israel, the LORD, is in your midst; You will no longer fear disaster. 







###### 16 



On that day it will be said to Jerusalem: "Do not be afraid, Zion; Do not let your hands fall limp. 







###### 17 



The LORD your God is in your midst, A [^f]victorious warrior. He will rejoice over you with joy, He will [^g]be quiet in His love, He will rejoice over you with shouts of joy. 







###### 18 



I will gather those who are worried about the appointed feasts-- They [^h]came from you, _Zion_; _The_ disgrace _of exile_ is a burden on [^i]them. 







###### 19 



Behold, I am going to deal at that time With all your oppressors; I will save those who limp And gather the scattered, And I will turn their shame into praise and fame In all the earth. 







###### 20 



At that time I will bring you in, Even at the time when I gather you together; Indeed, I will make you famous and praiseworthy Among all the peoples of the earth, When I restore your fortunes before your eyes," Says the LORD. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

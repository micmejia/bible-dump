###### 2 









With all my resources I have provided for the temple of my God--gold for the gold work, silver for the silver, bronze for the bronze, iron for the iron and wood for the wood, as well as onyx for the settings, turquoise,[^a] stones of various colors, and all kinds of fine stone and marble--all of these in large quantities. 



















###### 3 









Besides, in my devotion to the temple of my God I now give my personal treasures of gold and silver for the temple of my God, over and above everything I have provided for this holy temple: 



















###### 4 









three thousand talents[^b] of gold (gold of Ophir) and seven thousand talents[^c] of refined silver, for the overlaying of the walls of the buildings, 



















###### 5 









for the gold work and the silver work, and for all the work to be done by the craftsmen. Now, who is willing to consecrate themselves to the LORD today?" 



















###### 6 









Then the leaders of families, the officers of the tribes of Israel, the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, and the officials in charge of the king's work gave willingly.

Anyone who had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the temple of the LORD in the custody of Jehiel the Gershonite.

###### 15

LORD our God, all this abundance that we have provided for building you a temple for your Holy Name comes from your hand, and all of it belongs to you. 



















###### 17 









I know, my God, that you test the heart and are pleased with integrity. All these things I have given willingly and with honest intent. And now I have seen with joy how willingly your people who are here have given to you. 



















###### 18 









LORD, the God of our fathers Abraham, Isaac and Israel, keep these desires and thoughts in the hearts of your people forever, and keep their hearts loyal to you. 



















###### 19 









And give my son Solomon the wholehearted devotion to keep your commands, statutes and decrees and to do everything to build the palatial structure for which I have provided."

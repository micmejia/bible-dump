Jabez was more honorable than his brothers. His mother had named him Jabez,[^c] saying, "I gave birth to him in pain." 



















###### 10 









Jabez cried out to the God of Israel, "Oh, that you would bless me and enlarge my territory! Let your hand be with me, and keep me from harm so that I will be free from pain." And God granted his request.

###### 26 









The descendants of Mishma: Hammuel his son, Zakkur his son and Shimei his son. 



















###### 27 









Shimei had sixteen sons and six daughters, but his brothers did not have many children; so their entire clan did not become as numerous as the people of Judah.

Their surrounding villages were Etam, Ain, Rimmon, Token and Ashan--five towns--

and they went to the outskirts of Gedor to the east of the valley in search of pasture for their flocks. 



















###### 40 









They found rich, good pasture, and the land was spacious, peaceful and quiet. Some Hamites had lived there formerly. 



















###### 41 









The men whose names were listed came in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah. They attacked the Hamites in their dwellings and also the Meunites who were there and completely destroyed[^h] them, as is evident to this day. Then they settled in their place, because there was pasture for their flocks. 



















###### 42 









And five hundred of these Simeonites, led by Pelatiah, Neariah, Rephaiah and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi, invaded the hill country of Seir. 



















###### 43

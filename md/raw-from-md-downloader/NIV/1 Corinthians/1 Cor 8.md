# 1 Corinthians 8

***




















###### 1 









Now about food sacrificed to idols: We know that "We all possess knowledge." But knowledge puffs up while love builds up. 



















###### 2 









Those who think they know something do not yet know as they ought to know. 



















###### 3 









But whoever loves God is known by God.[^a] 



















###### 4 









So then, about eating food sacrificed to idols: We know that "An idol is nothing at all in the world" and that "There is no God but one." 



















###### 5 









For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as indeed there are many "gods" and many "lords"), 



















###### 6 









yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things came and for whom we live; and there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things came and through whom we live. 



















###### 7 









But not everyone possesses this knowledge. Some people are still so accustomed to idols that when they eat sacrificial food they think of it as having been sacrificed to a god, and since their conscience is weak, it is defiled. 



















###### 8 









But food does not bring us near to God; we are no worse if we do not eat, and no better if we do. 



















###### 9 









Be careful, however, that the exercise of your rights does not become a stumbling block to the weak. 



















###### 10 









For if someone with a weak conscience sees you, with all your knowledge, eating in an idol's temple, won't that person be emboldened to eat what is sacrificed to idols? 



















###### 11 









So this weak brother or sister, for whom Christ died, is destroyed by your knowledge. 



















###### 12 









When you sin against them in this way and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ. 



















###### 13 









Therefore, if what I eat causes my brother or sister to fall into sin, I will never eat meat again, so that I will not cause them to fall.

# 1 Peter 2

***




















###### 1 









Therefore, rid yourselves of all malice and all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and slander of every kind. 



















###### 2 









Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation, 



















###### 3 









now that you have tasted that the Lord is good. ## The Living Stone and a Chosen People 



















###### 4 









As you come to him, the living Stone--rejected by humans but chosen by God and precious to him-- 



















###### 5 









you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house[^a] to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. 



















###### 6 









For in Scripture it says: "See, I lay a stone in Zion, a chosen and precious cornerstone, and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame."[^b] 



















###### 7 









Now to you who believe, this stone is precious. But to those who do not believe, "The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone,"[^c] 



















###### 8 









and, "A stone that causes people to stumble and a rock that makes them fall."[^d] They stumble because they disobey the message--which is also what they were destined for. 



















###### 9 









But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light. 



















###### 10 









Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy. ## Living Godly Lives in a Pagan Society 



















###### 11 









Dear friends, I urge you, as foreigners and exiles, to abstain from sinful desires, which wage war against your soul. 



















###### 12 









Live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us. 



















###### 13 









Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every human authority: whether to the emperor, as the supreme authority, 



















###### 14 









or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right. 



















###### 15 









For it is God's will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish people. 



















###### 16 









Live as free people, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil; live as God's slaves. 



















###### 17 









Show proper respect to everyone, love the family of believers, fear God, honor the emperor. 



















###### 18 









Slaves, in reverent fear of God submit yourselves to your masters, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are harsh. 



















###### 19 









For it is commendable if someone bears up under the pain of unjust suffering because they are conscious of God. 



















###### 20 









But how is it to your credit if you receive a beating for doing wrong and endure it? But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable before God. 



















###### 21 









To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps. 



















###### 22 









"He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth."[^e] 



















###### 23 









When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly. 



















###### 24 









"He himself bore our sins" in his body on the cross, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; "by his wounds you have been healed." 



















###### 25 









For "you were like sheep going astray,"[^f] but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

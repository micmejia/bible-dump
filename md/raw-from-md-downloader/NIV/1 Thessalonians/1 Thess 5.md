# 1 Thessalonians 5

***




















###### 1 









Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, 



















###### 2 









for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. 



















###### 3 









While people are saying, "Peace and safety," destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. 



















###### 4 









But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. 



















###### 5 









You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. 



















###### 6 









So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober. 



















###### 7 









For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. 



















###### 8 









But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. 



















###### 9 









For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. 



















###### 10 









He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him. 



















###### 11 









Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you are doing. ## Final Instructions 



















###### 12 









Now we ask you, brothers and sisters, to acknowledge those who work hard among you, who care for you in the Lord and who admonish you. 



















###### 13 









Hold them in the highest regard in love because of their work. Live in peace with each other. 



















###### 14 









And we urge you, brothers and sisters, warn those who are idle and disruptive, encourage the disheartened, help the weak, be patient with everyone. 



















###### 15 









Make sure that nobody pays back wrong for wrong, but always strive to do what is good for each other and for everyone else. 



















###### 16 









Rejoice always, 



















###### 17 









pray continually, 



















###### 18 









give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus. 



















###### 19 









Do not quench the Spirit. 



















###### 20 









Do not treat prophecies with contempt 



















###### 21 









but test them all; hold on to what is good, 



















###### 22 









reject every kind of evil. 



















###### 23 









May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through. May your whole spirit, soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 



















###### 24 









The one who calls you is faithful, and he will do it. 



















###### 25 









Brothers and sisters, pray for us. 



















###### 26 









Greet all God's people with a holy kiss. 



















###### 27 









I charge you before the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers and sisters. 



















###### 28

# 1 Timothy 2

***




















###### 1 









I urge, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for all people-- 



















###### 2 









for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness. 



















###### 3 









This is good, and pleases God our Savior, 



















###### 4 









who wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth. 



















###### 5 









For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus, 



















###### 6 









who gave himself as a ransom for all people. This has now been witnessed to at the proper time. 



















###### 7 









And for this purpose I was appointed a herald and an apostle--I am telling the truth, I am not lying--and a true and faithful teacher of the Gentiles. 



















###### 8 









Therefore I want the men everywhere to pray, lifting up holy hands without anger or disputing. 



















###### 9 









I also want the women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, adorning themselves, not with elaborate hairstyles or gold or pearls or expensive clothes, 



















###### 10 









but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to worship God. 



















###### 11 









A woman[^a] should learn in quietness and full submission. 



















###### 12 









I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man;[^b] she must be quiet. 



















###### 13 









For Adam was formed first, then Eve. 



















###### 14 









And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner. 



















###### 15 









But women[^c] will be saved through childbearing--if they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

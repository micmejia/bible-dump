# 1 Timothy 3

***




















###### 1 









Here is a trustworthy saying: Whoever aspires to be an overseer desires a noble task. 



















###### 2 









Now the overseer is to be above reproach, faithful to his wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, 



















###### 3 









not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money. 



















###### 4 









He must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him, and he must do so in a manner worthy of full[^a] respect. 



















###### 5 









(If anyone does not know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of God's church?) 



















###### 6 









He must not be a recent convert, or he may become conceited and fall under the same judgment as the devil. 



















###### 7 









He must also have a good reputation with outsiders, so that he will not fall into disgrace and into the devil's trap. 



















###### 8 









In the same way, deacons[^b] are to be worthy of respect, sincere, not indulging in much wine, and not pursuing dishonest gain. 



















###### 9 









They must keep hold of the deep truths of the faith with a clear conscience. 



















###### 10 









They must first be tested; and then if there is nothing against them, let them serve as deacons. 



















###### 11 









In the same way, the women[^c] are to be worthy of respect, not malicious talkers but temperate and trustworthy in everything. 



















###### 12 









A deacon must be faithful to his wife and must manage his children and his household well. 



















###### 13 









Those who have served well gain an excellent standing and great assurance in their faith in Christ Jesus. ## Reasons for Paul's Instructions 



















###### 14 









Although I hope to come to you soon, I am writing you these instructions so that, 



















###### 15 









if I am delayed, you will know how people ought to conduct themselves in God's household, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth. 



















###### 16 









Beyond all question, the mystery from which true godliness springs is great: He appeared in the flesh, was vindicated by the Spirit,[^d] was seen by angels, was preached among the nations, was believed on in the world, was taken up in glory.

# 2 Corinthians 6

***




















###### 1 









As God's co-workers we urge you not to receive God's grace in vain. 



















###### 2 









For he says, "In the time of my favor I heard you, and in the day of salvation I helped you."[^a] I tell you, now is the time of God's favor, now is the day of salvation. ## Paul's Hardships 



















###### 3 









We put no stumbling block in anyone's path, so that our ministry will not be discredited. 



















###### 4 









Rather, as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way: in great endurance; in troubles, hardships and distresses; 



















###### 5 









in beatings, imprisonments and riots; in hard work, sleepless nights and hunger; 



















###### 6 









in purity, understanding, patience and kindness; in the Holy Spirit and in sincere love; 



















###### 7 









in truthful speech and in the power of God; with weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left; 



















###### 8 









through glory and dishonor, bad report and good report; genuine, yet regarded as impostors; 



















###### 9 









known, yet regarded as unknown; dying, and yet we live on; beaten, and yet not killed; 



















###### 10 









sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; poor, yet making many rich; having nothing, and yet possessing everything. 



















###### 11 









We have spoken freely to you, Corinthians, and opened wide our hearts to you. 



















###### 12 









We are not withholding our affection from you, but you are withholding yours from us. 



















###### 13 









As a fair exchange--I speak as to my children--open wide your hearts also. ## Warning Against Idolatry 



















###### 14 









Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness? 



















###### 15 









What harmony is there between Christ and Belial[^b]? Or what does a believer have in common with an unbeliever? 



















###### 16 









What agreement is there between the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God. As God has said: "I will live with them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be my people."[^c] 



















###### 17 









Therefore, "Come out from them and be separate, says the Lord. Touch no unclean thing, and I will receive you."[^d] 



















###### 18 









And, "I will be a Father to you, and you will be my sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty."[^e] NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

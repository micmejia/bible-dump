###### 4 









The high places, however, were not removed; the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there. 



















###### 5 









The LORD afflicted the king with leprosy[^b] until the day he died, and he lived in a separate house.[^c] Jotham the king's son had charge of the palace and governed the people of the land.

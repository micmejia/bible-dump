***




















###### 1 









After the king was settled in his palace and the LORD had given him rest from all his enemies around him, 



















###### 2 









he said to Nathan the prophet, "Here I am, living in a house of cedar, while the ark of God remains in a tent." 



















###### 3 









Nathan replied to the king, "Whatever you have in mind, go ahead and do it, for the LORD is with you." 



















###### 4 









But that night the word of the LORD came to Nathan, saying: 



















###### 5 









"Go and tell my servant David, 'This is what the LORD says: Are you the one to build me a house to dwell in? 



















###### 6 









I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought the Israelites up out of Egypt to this day. I have been moving from place to place with a tent as my dwelling. 



















###### 7 









Wherever I have moved with all the Israelites, did I ever say to any of their rulers whom I commanded to shepherd my people Israel, "Why have you not built me a house of cedar?"' 



















###### 8 









"Now then, tell my servant David, 'This is what the LORD Almighty says: I took you from the pasture, from tending the flock, and appointed you ruler over my people Israel. 



















###### 9 









I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have cut off all your enemies from before you. Now I will make your name great, like the names of the greatest men on earth. 



















###### 10 









And I will provide a place for my people Israel and will plant them so that they can have a home of their own and no longer be disturbed. Wicked people will not oppress them anymore, as they did at the beginning 



















###### 11 









and have done ever since the time I appointed leaders[^a] over my people Israel. I will also give you rest from all your enemies. "'The LORD declares to you that the LORD himself will establish a house for you: 



















###### 12 









When your days are over and you rest with your ancestors, I will raise up your offspring to succeed you, your own flesh and blood, and I will establish his kingdom. 



















###### 13 









He is the one who will build a house for my Name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. 



















###### 14 









I will be his father, and he will be my son. When he does wrong, I will punish him with a rod wielded by men, with floggings inflicted by human hands. 



















###### 15 









But my love will never be taken away from him, as I took it away from Saul, whom I removed from before you. 



















###### 16 









Your house and your kingdom will endure forever before me[^b]; your throne will be established forever.'" 



















###### 17

###### 19

###### 20

###### 24

###### 27

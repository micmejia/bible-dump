Therefore, among God's churches we boast about your perseverance and faith in all the persecutions and trials you are enduring.

We pray this so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.[^c] NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

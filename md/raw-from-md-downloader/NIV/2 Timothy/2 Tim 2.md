# 2 Timothy 2

***




















###### 1 









You then, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. 



















###### 2 









And the things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable people who will also be qualified to teach others. 



















###### 3 









Join with me in suffering, like a good soldier of Christ Jesus. 



















###### 4 









No one serving as a soldier gets entangled in civilian affairs, but rather tries to please his commanding officer. 



















###### 5 









Similarly, anyone who competes as an athlete does not receive the victor's crown except by competing according to the rules. 



















###### 6 









The hardworking farmer should be the first to receive a share of the crops. 



















###### 7 









Reflect on what I am saying, for the Lord will give you insight into all this. 



















###### 8 









Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, descended from David. This is my gospel, 



















###### 9 









for which I am suffering even to the point of being chained like a criminal. But God's word is not chained. 



















###### 10 









Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory. 



















###### 11 









Here is a trustworthy saying: If we died with him, we will also live with him; 



















###### 12 









if we endure, we will also reign with him. If we disown him, he will also disown us; 



















###### 13 









if we are faithless, he remains faithful, for he cannot disown himself. ## Dealing With False Teachers 



















###### 14 









Keep reminding God's people of these things. Warn them before God against quarreling about words; it is of no value, and only ruins those who listen. 



















###### 15 









Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth. 



















###### 16 









Avoid godless chatter, because those who indulge in it will become more and more ungodly. 



















###### 17 









Their teaching will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, 



















###### 18 









who have departed from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already taken place, and they destroy the faith of some. 



















###### 19 









Nevertheless, God's solid foundation stands firm, sealed with this inscription: "The Lord knows those who are his," and, "Everyone who confesses the name of the Lord must turn away from wickedness." 



















###### 20 









In a large house there are articles not only of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay; some are for special purposes and some for common use. 



















###### 21 









Those who cleanse themselves from the latter will be instruments for special purposes, made holy, useful to the Master and prepared to do any good work. 



















###### 22 









Flee the evil desires of youth and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. 



















###### 23 









Don't have anything to do with foolish and stupid arguments, because you know they produce quarrels. 



















###### 24 









And the Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome but must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful. 



















###### 25 









Opponents must be gently instructed, in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth, 



















###### 26 









and that they will come to their senses and escape from the trap of the devil, who has taken them captive to do his will. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

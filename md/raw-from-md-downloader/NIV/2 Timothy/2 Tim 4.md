# 2 Timothy 4

***




















###### 1 









In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead, and in view of his appearing and his kingdom, I give you this charge: 



















###### 2 









Preach the word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage--with great patience and careful instruction. 



















###### 3 









For the time will come when people will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear. 



















###### 4 









They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths. 



















###### 5 









But you, keep your head in all situations, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, discharge all the duties of your ministry. 



















###### 6 









For I am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the time for my departure is near. 



















###### 7 









I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. 



















###### 8 









Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day--and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing. ## Personal Remarks 



















###### 9 









Do your best to come to me quickly, 



















###### 10 









for Demas, because he loved this world, has deserted me and has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia. 



















###### 11 









Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, because he is helpful to me in my ministry. 



















###### 12 









I sent Tychicus to Ephesus. 



















###### 13 









When you come, bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas, and my scrolls, especially the parchments. 



















###### 14 









Alexander the metalworker did me a great deal of harm. The Lord will repay him for what he has done. 



















###### 15 









You too should be on your guard against him, because he strongly opposed our message. 



















###### 16 









At my first defense, no one came to my support, but everyone deserted me. May it not be held against them. 



















###### 17 









But the Lord stood at my side and gave me strength, so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. And I was delivered from the lion's mouth. 



















###### 18 









The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack and will bring me safely to his heavenly kingdom. To him be glory for ever and ever. Amen. ## Final Greetings 



















###### 19 









Greet Priscilla[^a] and Aquila and the household of Onesiphorus. 



















###### 20 









Erastus stayed in Corinth, and I left Trophimus sick in Miletus. 



















###### 21 









Do your best to get here before winter. Eubulus greets you, and so do Pudens, Linus, Claudia and all the brothers and sisters.[^b]

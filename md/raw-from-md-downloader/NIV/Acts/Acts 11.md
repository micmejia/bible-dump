# Acts 11

***




















###### 1

So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcised believers criticized him 



















###### 3

###### 6 









I looked into it and saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, reptiles and birds. 



















###### 7 









Then I heard a voice telling me, 'Get up, Peter. Kill and eat.' 



















###### 8 









"I replied, 'Surely not, Lord! Nothing impure or unclean has ever entered my mouth.' 



















###### 9

###### 10

"As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit came on them as he had come on us at the beginning. 



















###### 16

###### 17 









So if God gave them the same gift he gave us who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to think that I could stand in God's way?" 



















###### 18 









When they heard this, they had no further objections and praised God, saying, "So then, even to Gentiles God has granted repentance that leads to life." ## The Church in Antioch

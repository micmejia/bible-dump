###### 4 









Peter looked straight at him, as did John. Then Peter said, "Look at us!"

Taking him by the right hand, he helped him up, and instantly the man's feet and ankles became strong. 



















###### 8 









He jumped to his feet and began to walk. Then he went with them into the temple courts, walking and jumping, and praising God.

When all the people saw him walking and praising God,

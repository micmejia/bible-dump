# Amos 3

***




















###### 1 









Hear this word, people of Israel, the word the LORD has spoken against you--against the whole family I brought up out of Egypt: 



















###### 2 









"You only have I chosen of all the families of the earth; therefore I will punish you for all your sins." 



















###### 3 









Do two walk together unless they have agreed to do so? 



















###### 4 









Does a lion roar in the thicket when it has no prey? Does it growl in its den when it has caught nothing? 



















###### 5 









Does a bird swoop down to a trap on the ground when no bait is there? Does a trap spring up from the ground if it has not caught anything? 



















###### 6 









When a trumpet sounds in a city, do not the people tremble? When disaster comes to a city, has not the LORD caused it? 



















###### 7 









Surely the Sovereign LORD does nothing without revealing his plan to his servants the prophets. 



















###### 8 









The lion has roared-- who will not fear? The Sovereign LORD has spoken-- who can but prophesy? 



















###### 9 









Proclaim to the fortresses of Ashdod and to the fortresses of Egypt: "Assemble yourselves on the mountains of Samaria; see the great unrest within her and the oppression among her people." 



















###### 10 









"They do not know how to do right," declares the LORD, "who store up in their fortresses what they have plundered and looted." 



















###### 11 









Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: "An enemy will overrun your land, pull down your strongholds and plunder your fortresses." 



















###### 12 









This is what the LORD says: "As a shepherd rescues from the lion's mouth only two leg bones or a piece of an ear, so will the Israelites living in Samaria be rescued, with only the head of a bed and a piece of fabric[^a] from a couch.[^b]" 



















###### 13 









"Hear this and testify against the descendants of Jacob," declares the Lord, the LORD God Almighty. 



















###### 14 









"On the day I punish Israel for her sins, I will destroy the altars of Bethel; the horns of the altar will be cut off and fall to the ground. 



















###### 15 









I will tear down the winter house along with the summer house; the houses adorned with ivory will be destroyed and the mansions will be demolished," declares the LORD.

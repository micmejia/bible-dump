# Amos 7

***




















###### 1 









This is what the Sovereign LORD showed me: He was preparing swarms of locusts after the king's share had been harvested and just as the late crops were coming up. 



















###### 2 









When they had stripped the land clean, I cried out, "Sovereign LORD, forgive! How can Jacob survive? He is so small!" 



















###### 3 









So the LORD relented. "This will not happen," the LORD said. 



















###### 4 









This is what the Sovereign LORD showed me: The Sovereign LORD was calling for judgment by fire; it dried up the great deep and devoured the land. 



















###### 5 









Then I cried out, "Sovereign LORD, I beg you, stop! How can Jacob survive? He is so small!" 



















###### 6 









So the LORD relented. "This will not happen either," the Sovereign LORD said. 



















###### 7 









This is what he showed me: The Lord was standing by a wall that had been built true to plumb,[^a] with a plumb line[^b] in his hand. 



















###### 8 









And the LORD asked me, "What do you see, Amos?" "A plumb line," I replied. Then the Lord said, "Look, I am setting a plumb line among my people Israel; I will spare them no longer. 



















###### 9 









"The high places of Isaac will be destroyed and the sanctuaries of Israel will be ruined; with my sword I will rise against the house of Jeroboam." ## Amos and Amaziah 



















###### 10 









Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent a message to Jeroboam king of Israel: "Amos is raising a conspiracy against you in the very heart of Israel. The land cannot bear all his words. 



















###### 11 









For this is what Amos is saying: "'Jeroboam will die by the sword, and Israel will surely go into exile, away from their native land.'" 



















###### 12 









Then Amaziah said to Amos, "Get out, you seer! Go back to the land of Judah. Earn your bread there and do your prophesying there. 



















###### 13 









Don't prophesy anymore at Bethel, because this is the king's sanctuary and the temple of the kingdom." 



















###### 14 









Amos answered Amaziah, "I was neither a prophet nor the son of a prophet, but I was a shepherd, and I also took care of sycamore-fig trees. 



















###### 15 









But the LORD took me from tending the flock and said to me, 'Go, prophesy to my people Israel.' 



















###### 16 









Now then, hear the word of the LORD. You say, "'Do not prophesy against Israel, and stop preaching against the descendants of Isaac.' 



















###### 17 









"Therefore this is what the LORD says: "'Your wife will become a prostitute in the city, and your sons and daughters will fall by the sword. Your land will be measured and divided up, and you yourself will die in a pagan[^c] country. And Israel will surely go into exile, away from their native land.'"

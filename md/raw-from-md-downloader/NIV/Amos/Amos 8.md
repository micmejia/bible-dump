# Amos 8

***




















###### 1 









This is what the Sovereign LORD showed me: a basket of ripe fruit. 



















###### 2 









"What do you see, Amos?" he asked. "A basket of ripe fruit," I answered. Then the LORD said to me, "The time is ripe for my people Israel; I will spare them no longer. 



















###### 3 









"In that day," declares the Sovereign LORD, "the songs in the temple will turn to wailing.[^a] Many, many bodies--flung everywhere! Silence!" 



















###### 4 









Hear this, you who trample the needy and do away with the poor of the land, 



















###### 5 









saying, "When will the New Moon be over that we may sell grain, and the Sabbath be ended that we may market wheat?"-- skimping on the measure, boosting the price and cheating with dishonest scales, 



















###### 6 









buying the poor with silver and the needy for a pair of sandals, selling even the sweepings with the wheat. 



















###### 7 









The LORD has sworn by himself, the Pride of Jacob: "I will never forget anything they have done. 



















###### 8 









"Will not the land tremble for this, and all who live in it mourn? The whole land will rise like the Nile; it will be stirred up and then sink like the river of Egypt. 



















###### 9 









"In that day," declares the Sovereign LORD, "I will make the sun go down at noon and darken the earth in broad daylight. 



















###### 10 









I will turn your religious festivals into mourning and all your singing into weeping. I will make all of you wear sackcloth and shave your heads. I will make that time like mourning for an only son and the end of it like a bitter day. 



















###### 11 









"The days are coming," declares the Sovereign LORD, "when I will send a famine through the land-- not a famine of food or a thirst for water, but a famine of hearing the words of the LORD. 



















###### 12 









People will stagger from sea to sea and wander from north to east, searching for the word of the LORD, but they will not find it. 



















###### 13 









"In that day "the lovely young women and strong young men will faint because of thirst. 



















###### 14 









Those who swear by the sin of Samaria-- who say, 'As surely as your god lives, Dan,' or, 'As surely as the god[^b] of Beersheba lives'-- they will fall, never to rise again."

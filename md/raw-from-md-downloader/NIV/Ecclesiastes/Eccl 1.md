# Ecclesiastes 1

***




















###### 1 









The words of the Teacher,[^a] son of David, king in Jerusalem: 



















###### 2 









"Meaningless! Meaningless!" says the Teacher. "Utterly meaningless! Everything is meaningless." 



















###### 3 









What do people gain from all their labors at which they toil under the sun? 



















###### 4 









Generations come and generations go, but the earth remains forever. 



















###### 5 









The sun rises and the sun sets, and hurries back to where it rises. 



















###### 6 









The wind blows to the south and turns to the north; round and round it goes, ever returning on its course. 



















###### 7 









All streams flow into the sea, yet the sea is never full. To the place the streams come from, there they return again. 



















###### 8 









All things are wearisome, more than one can say. The eye never has enough of seeing, nor the ear its fill of hearing. 



















###### 9 









What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun. 



















###### 10 









Is there anything of which one can say, "Look! This is something new"? It was here already, long ago; it was here before our time. 



















###### 11 









No one remembers the former generations, and even those yet to come will not be remembered by those who follow them. ## Wisdom Is Meaningless 



















###### 12 









I, the Teacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem. 



















###### 13 









I applied my mind to study and to explore by wisdom all that is done under the heavens. What a heavy burden God has laid on mankind! 



















###### 14 









I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind. 



















###### 15 









What is crooked cannot be straightened; what is lacking cannot be counted. 



















###### 16 









I said to myself, "Look, I have increased in wisdom more than anyone who has ruled over Jerusalem before me; I have experienced much of wisdom and knowledge." 



















###### 17 









Then I applied myself to the understanding of wisdom, and also of madness and folly, but I learned that this, too, is a chasing after the wind. 



















###### 18 









For with much wisdom comes much sorrow; the more knowledge, the more grief. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

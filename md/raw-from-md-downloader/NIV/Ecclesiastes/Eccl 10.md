# Ecclesiastes 10

***




















###### 1 









As dead flies give perfume a bad smell, so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor. 



















###### 2 









The heart of the wise inclines to the right, but the heart of the fool to the left. 



















###### 3 









Even as fools walk along the road, they lack sense and show everyone how stupid they are. 



















###### 4 









If a ruler's anger rises against you, do not leave your post; calmness can lay great offenses to rest. 



















###### 5 









There is an evil I have seen under the sun, the sort of error that arises from a ruler: 



















###### 6 









Fools are put in many high positions, while the rich occupy the low ones. 



















###### 7 









I have seen slaves on horseback, while princes go on foot like slaves. 



















###### 8 









Whoever digs a pit may fall into it; whoever breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake. 



















###### 9 









Whoever quarries stones may be injured by them; whoever splits logs may be endangered by them. 



















###### 10 









If the ax is dull and its edge unsharpened, more strength is needed, but skill will bring success. 



















###### 11 









If a snake bites before it is charmed, the charmer receives no fee. 



















###### 12 









Words from the mouth of the wise are gracious, but fools are consumed by their own lips. 



















###### 13 









At the beginning their words are folly; at the end they are wicked madness-- 



















###### 14 









and fools multiply words. No one knows what is coming-- who can tell someone else what will happen after them? 



















###### 15 









The toil of fools wearies them; they do not know the way to town. 



















###### 16 









Woe to the land whose king was a servant[^a] and whose princes feast in the morning. 



















###### 17 









Blessed is the land whose king is of noble birth and whose princes eat at a proper time-- for strength and not for drunkenness. 



















###### 18 









Through laziness, the rafters sag; because of idle hands, the house leaks. 



















###### 19 









A feast is made for laughter, wine makes life merry, and money is the answer for everything. 



















###### 20 









Do not revile the king even in your thoughts, or curse the rich in your bedroom, because a bird in the sky may carry your words, and a bird on the wing may report what you say.

# Ecclesiastes 12

***




















###### 1 









Remember your Creator in the days of your youth, before the days of trouble come and the years approach when you will say, "I find no pleasure in them"-- 



















###### 2 









before the sun and the light and the moon and the stars grow dark, and the clouds return after the rain; 



















###### 3 









when the keepers of the house tremble, and the strong men stoop, when the grinders cease because they are few, and those looking through the windows grow dim; 



















###### 4 









when the doors to the street are closed and the sound of grinding fades; when people rise up at the sound of birds, but all their songs grow faint; 



















###### 5 









when people are afraid of heights and of dangers in the streets; when the almond tree blossoms and the grasshopper drags itself along and desire no longer is stirred. Then people go to their eternal home and mourners go about the streets. 



















###### 6 









Remember him--before the silver cord is severed, and the golden bowl is broken; before the pitcher is shattered at the spring, and the wheel broken at the well, 



















###### 7 









and the dust returns to the ground it came from, and the spirit returns to God who gave it. 



















###### 8 









"Meaningless! Meaningless!" says the Teacher.[^a] "Everything is meaningless!" ## The Conclusion of the Matter 



















###### 9 









Not only was the Teacher wise, but he also imparted knowledge to the people. He pondered and searched out and set in order many proverbs. 



















###### 10 









The Teacher searched to find just the right words, and what he wrote was upright and true. 



















###### 11 









The words of the wise are like goads, their collected sayings like firmly embedded nails--given by one shepherd.[^b] 



















###### 12 









Be warned, my son, of anything in addition to them. Of making many books there is no end, and much study wearies the body. 



















###### 13 









Now all has been heard; here is the conclusion of the matter: Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the duty of all mankind. 



















###### 14

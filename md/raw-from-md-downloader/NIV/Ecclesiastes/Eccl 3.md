# Ecclesiastes 3

***




















###### 1 









There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens: 



















###### 2 









a time to be born and a time to die, a time to plant and a time to uproot, 



















###### 3 









a time to kill and a time to heal, a time to tear down and a time to build, 



















###### 4 









a time to weep and a time to laugh, a time to mourn and a time to dance, 



















###### 5 









a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them, a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing, 



















###### 6 









a time to search and a time to give up, a time to keep and a time to throw away, 



















###### 7 









a time to tear and a time to mend, a time to be silent and a time to speak, 



















###### 8 









a time to love and a time to hate, a time for war and a time for peace. 



















###### 9 









What do workers gain from their toil? 



















###### 10 









I have seen the burden God has laid on the human race. 



















###### 11 









He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the human heart; yet[^a] no one can fathom what God has done from beginning to end. 



















###### 12 









I know that there is nothing better for people than to be happy and to do good while they live. 



















###### 13 









That each of them may eat and drink, and find satisfaction in all their toil--this is the gift of God. 



















###### 14 









I know that everything God does will endure forever; nothing can be added to it and nothing taken from it. God does it so that people will fear him. 



















###### 15 









Whatever is has already been, and what will be has been before; and God will call the past to account.[^b] 



















###### 16 









And I saw something else under the sun: In the place of judgment--wickedness was there, in the place of justice--wickedness was there. 



















###### 17 









I said to myself, "God will bring into judgment both the righteous and the wicked, for there will be a time for every activity, a time to judge every deed." 



















###### 18 









I also said to myself, "As for humans, God tests them so that they may see that they are like the animals. 



















###### 19 









Surely the fate of human beings is like that of the animals; the same fate awaits them both: As one dies, so dies the other. All have the same breath[^c]; humans have no advantage over animals. Everything is meaningless. 



















###### 20 









All go to the same place; all come from dust, and to dust all return. 



















###### 21 









Who knows if the human spirit rises upward and if the spirit of the animal goes down into the earth?" 



















###### 22 









So I saw that there is nothing better for a person than to enjoy their work, because that is their lot. For who can bring them to see what will happen after them?

# Ecclesiastes 4

***




















###### 1 









Again I looked and saw all the oppression that was taking place under the sun: I saw the tears of the oppressed-- and they have no comforter; power was on the side of their oppressors-- and they have no comforter. 



















###### 2 









And I declared that the dead, who had already died, are happier than the living, who are still alive. 



















###### 3 









But better than both is the one who has never been born, who has not seen the evil that is done under the sun. 



















###### 4 









And I saw that all toil and all achievement spring from one person's envy of another. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind. 



















###### 5 









Fools fold their hands and ruin themselves. 



















###### 6 









Better one handful with tranquillity than two handfuls with toil and chasing after the wind. 



















###### 7 









Again I saw something meaningless under the sun: 



















###### 8 









There was a man all alone; he had neither son nor brother. There was no end to his toil, yet his eyes were not content with his wealth. "For whom am I toiling," he asked, "and why am I depriving myself of enjoyment?" This too is meaningless-- a miserable business! 



















###### 9 









Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor: 



















###### 10 









If either of them falls down, one can help the other up. But pity anyone who falls and has no one to help them up. 



















###### 11 









Also, if two lie down together, they will keep warm. But how can one keep warm alone? 



















###### 12 









Though one may be overpowered, two can defend themselves. A cord of three strands is not quickly broken. ## Advancement Is Meaningless 



















###### 13 









Better a poor but wise youth than an old but foolish king who no longer knows how to heed a warning. 



















###### 14 









The youth may have come from prison to the kingship, or he may have been born in poverty within his kingdom. 



















###### 15 









I saw that all who lived and walked under the sun followed the youth, the king's successor. 



















###### 16 









There was no end to all the people who were before them. But those who came later were not pleased with the successor. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.

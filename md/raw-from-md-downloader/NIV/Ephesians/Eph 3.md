# Ephesians 3

***




















###### 1 









For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles-- 



















###### 2 









Surely you have heard about the administration of God's grace that was given to me for you, 



















###### 3 









that is, the mystery made known to me by revelation, as I have already written briefly. 



















###### 4 









In reading this, then, you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ, 



















###### 5 









which was not made known to people in other generations as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to God's holy apostles and prophets. 



















###### 6 









This mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel, members together of one body, and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus. 



















###### 7 









I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God's grace given me through the working of his power. 



















###### 8 









Although I am less than the least of all the Lord's people, this grace was given me: to preach to the Gentiles the boundless riches of Christ, 



















###### 9 









and to make plain to everyone the administration of this mystery, which for ages past was kept hidden in God, who created all things. 



















###### 10 









His intent was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms, 



















###### 11 









according to his eternal purpose that he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord. 



















###### 12 









In him and through faith in him we may approach God with freedom and confidence. 



















###### 13 









I ask you, therefore, not to be discouraged because of my sufferings for you, which are your glory. ## A Prayer for the Ephesians 



















###### 14 









For this reason I kneel before the Father, 



















###### 15 









from whom every family[^a] in heaven and on earth derives its name. 



















###### 16 









I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being, 



















###### 17 









so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love, 



















###### 18 









may have power, together with all the Lord's holy people, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ, 



















###### 19 









and to know this love that surpasses knowledge--that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God. 



















###### 20 









Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us, 



















###### 21 









to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever! Amen. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

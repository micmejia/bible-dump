***
# Ephesians 5 (New International Version) 



















###### 3 









But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed, because these are improper for God's holy people. 



















###### 4 









Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking, which are out of place, but rather thanksgiving. 



















###### 5 









For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure or greedy person--such a person is an idolater--has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.[^a] 



















###### 6 









Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things God's wrath comes on those who are disobedient. 



















###### 7 









Therefore do not be partners with them. 



















###### 8 









For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light 



















###### 9 









(for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness and truth) 



















###### 10 









and find out what pleases the Lord. 



















###### 11 









Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them. 



















###### 12 









It is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret. 



















###### 13 









But everything exposed by the light becomes visible--and everything that is illuminated becomes a light. 



















###### 14 









This is why it is said: "Wake up, sleeper, rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you." 



















###### 15 









Be very careful, then, how you live--not as unwise but as wise, 



















###### 16 









making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil. 



















###### 17 









Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord's will is. 



















###### 18 









Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit, 



















###### 19 









speaking to one another with psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit. Sing and make music from your heart to the Lord, 



















###### 20 









always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. ## Instructions for Christian Households 



















###### 21 









Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ. 



















###### 22 









Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord. 



















###### 23 









For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. 



















###### 24 









Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything. 



















###### 25 









Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her 



















###### 26 









to make her holy, cleansing[^b] her by the washing with water through the word, 



















###### 27 









and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless. 



















###### 28 









In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. 



















###### 29 









After all, no one ever hated their own body, but they feed and care for their body, just as Christ does the church-- 



















###### 30 









for we are members of his body. 



















###### 31 









"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh."[^c] 



















###### 32 









This is a profound mystery--but I am talking about Christ and the church. 



















###### 33 









However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

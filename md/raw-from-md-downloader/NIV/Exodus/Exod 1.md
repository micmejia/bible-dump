# Exodus 1

***




















###### 1 









These are the names of the sons of Israel who went to Egypt with Jacob, each with his family: 



















###### 2 









Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah; 



















###### 3 









Issachar, Zebulun and Benjamin; 



















###### 4 









Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher. 



















###### 5 









The descendants of Jacob numbered seventy[^a] in all; Joseph was already in Egypt. 



















###### 6 









Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died, 



















###### 7 









but the Israelites were exceedingly fruitful; they multiplied greatly, increased in numbers and became so numerous that the land was filled with them. 



















###### 8 









Then a new king, to whom Joseph meant nothing, came to power in Egypt. 



















###### 9 









"Look," he said to his people, "the Israelites have become far too numerous for us. 



















###### 10 









Come, we must deal shrewdly with them or they will become even more numerous and, if war breaks out, will join our enemies, fight against us and leave the country." 



















###### 11 









So they put slave masters over them to oppress them with forced labor, and they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh. 



















###### 12 









But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread; so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites 



















###### 13 









and worked them ruthlessly. 



















###### 14 









They made their lives bitter with harsh labor in brick and mortar and with all kinds of work in the fields; in all their harsh labor the Egyptians worked them ruthlessly. 



















###### 15 









The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah, 



















###### 16 









"When you are helping the Hebrew women during childbirth on the delivery stool, if you see that the baby is a boy, kill him; but if it is a girl, let her live." 



















###### 17 









The midwives, however, feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them to do; they let the boys live. 



















###### 18 









Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, "Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?" 



















###### 19 









The midwives answered Pharaoh, "Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women; they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives arrive." 



















###### 20 









So God was kind to the midwives and the people increased and became even more numerous. 



















###### 21 









And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families of their own. 



















###### 22 









Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his people: "Every Hebrew boy that is born you must throw into the Nile, but let every girl live."

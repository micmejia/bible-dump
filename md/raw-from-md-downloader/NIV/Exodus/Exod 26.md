# Exodus 26

***




















###### 1 









"Make the tabernacle with ten curtains of finely twisted linen and blue, purple and scarlet yarn, with cherubim woven into them by a skilled worker. 



















###### 2 









All the curtains are to be the same size--twenty-eight cubits long and four cubits wide.[^a] 



















###### 3 









Join five of the curtains together, and do the same with the other five. 



















###### 4 









Make loops of blue material along the edge of the end curtain in one set, and do the same with the end curtain in the other set. 



















###### 5 









Make fifty loops on one curtain and fifty loops on the end curtain of the other set, with the loops opposite each other. 



















###### 6 









Then make fifty gold clasps and use them to fasten the curtains together so that the tabernacle is a unit. 



















###### 7 









"Make curtains of goat hair for the tent over the tabernacle--eleven altogether. 



















###### 8 









All eleven curtains are to be the same size--thirty cubits long and four cubits wide.[^b] 



















###### 9 









Join five of the curtains together into one set and the other six into another set. Fold the sixth curtain double at the front of the tent. 



















###### 10 









Make fifty loops along the edge of the end curtain in one set and also along the edge of the end curtain in the other set. 



















###### 11 









Then make fifty bronze clasps and put them in the loops to fasten the tent together as a unit. 



















###### 12 









As for the additional length of the tent curtains, the half curtain that is left over is to hang down at the rear of the tabernacle. 



















###### 13 









The tent curtains will be a cubit[^c] longer on both sides; what is left will hang over the sides of the tabernacle so as to cover it. 



















###### 14 









Make for the tent a covering of ram skins dyed red, and over that a covering of the other durable leather.[^d] 



















###### 15 









"Make upright frames of acacia wood for the tabernacle. 



















###### 16 









Each frame is to be ten cubits long and a cubit and a half wide,[^e] 



















###### 17 









with two projections set parallel to each other. Make all the frames of the tabernacle in this way. 



















###### 18 









Make twenty frames for the south side of the tabernacle 



















###### 19 









and make forty silver bases to go under them--two bases for each frame, one under each projection. 



















###### 20 









For the other side, the north side of the tabernacle, make twenty frames 



















###### 21 









and forty silver bases--two under each frame. 



















###### 22 









Make six frames for the far end, that is, the west end of the tabernacle, 



















###### 23 









and make two frames for the corners at the far end. 



















###### 24 









At these two corners they must be double from the bottom all the way to the top and fitted into a single ring; both shall be like that. 



















###### 25 









So there will be eight frames and sixteen silver bases--two under each frame. 



















###### 26 









"Also make crossbars of acacia wood: five for the frames on one side of the tabernacle, 



















###### 27 









five for those on the other side, and five for the frames on the west, at the far end of the tabernacle. 



















###### 28 









The center crossbar is to extend from end to end at the middle of the frames. 



















###### 29 









Overlay the frames with gold and make gold rings to hold the crossbars. Also overlay the crossbars with gold. 



















###### 30 









"Set up the tabernacle according to the plan shown you on the mountain. 



















###### 31 









"Make a curtain of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen, with cherubim woven into it by a skilled worker. 



















###### 32 









Hang it with gold hooks on four posts of acacia wood overlaid with gold and standing on four silver bases. 



















###### 33 









Hang the curtain from the clasps and place the ark of the covenant law behind the curtain. The curtain will separate the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place. 



















###### 34 









Put the atonement cover on the ark of the covenant law in the Most Holy Place. 



















###### 35 









Place the table outside the curtain on the north side of the tabernacle and put the lampstand opposite it on the south side. 



















###### 36 









"For the entrance to the tent make a curtain of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen--the work of an embroiderer. 



















###### 37 









Make gold hooks for this curtain and five posts of acacia wood overlaid with gold. And cast five bronze bases for them. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

# Exodus 30

***




















###### 1 









"Make an altar of acacia wood for burning incense. 



















###### 2 









It is to be square, a cubit long and a cubit wide, and two cubits high[^a]--its horns of one piece with it. 



















###### 3 









Overlay the top and all the sides and the horns with pure gold, and make a gold molding around it. 



















###### 4 









Make two gold rings for the altar below the molding--two on each of the opposite sides--to hold the poles used to carry it. 



















###### 5 









Make the poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold. 



















###### 6 









Put the altar in front of the curtain that shields the ark of the covenant law--before the atonement cover that is over the tablets of the covenant law--where I will meet with you. 



















###### 7 









"Aaron must burn fragrant incense on the altar every morning when he tends the lamps. 



















###### 8 









He must burn incense again when he lights the lamps at twilight so incense will burn regularly before the LORD for the generations to come. 



















###### 9 









Do not offer on this altar any other incense or any burnt offering or grain offering, and do not pour a drink offering on it. 



















###### 10 









Once a year Aaron shall make atonement on its horns. This annual atonement must be made with the blood of the atoning sin offering[^b] for the generations to come. It is most holy to the LORD." ## Atonement Money 



















###### 11 









Then the LORD said to Moses, 



















###### 12 









"When you take a census of the Israelites to count them, each one must pay the LORD a ransom for his life at the time he is counted. Then no plague will come on them when you number them. 



















###### 13 









Each one who crosses over to those already counted is to give a half shekel,[^c] according to the sanctuary shekel, which weighs twenty gerahs. This half shekel is an offering to the LORD. 



















###### 14 









All who cross over, those twenty years old or more, are to give an offering to the LORD. 



















###### 15 









The rich are not to give more than a half shekel and the poor are not to give less when you make the offering to the LORD to atone for your lives. 



















###### 16 









Receive the atonement money from the Israelites and use it for the service of the tent of meeting. It will be a memorial for the Israelites before the LORD, making atonement for your lives." ## Basin for Washing 



















###### 17 









Then the LORD said to Moses, 



















###### 18 









"Make a bronze basin, with its bronze stand, for washing. Place it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water in it. 



















###### 19 









Aaron and his sons are to wash their hands and feet with water from it. 



















###### 20 









Whenever they enter the tent of meeting, they shall wash with water so that they will not die. Also, when they approach the altar to minister by presenting a food offering to the LORD, 



















###### 21 









they shall wash their hands and feet so that they will not die. This is to be a lasting ordinance for Aaron and his descendants for the generations to come." ## Anointing Oil 



















###### 22 









Then the LORD said to Moses, 



















###### 23 









"Take the following fine spices: 500 shekels[^d] of liquid myrrh, half as much (that is, 250 shekels) of fragrant cinnamon, 250 shekels[^e] of fragrant calamus, 



















###### 24 









500 shekels of cassia--all according to the sanctuary shekel--and a hin[^f] of olive oil. 



















###### 25 









Make these into a sacred anointing oil, a fragrant blend, the work of a perfumer. It will be the sacred anointing oil. 



















###### 26 









Then use it to anoint the tent of meeting, the ark of the covenant law, 



















###### 27 









the table and all its articles, the lampstand and its accessories, the altar of incense, 



















###### 28 









the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and the basin with its stand. 



















###### 29 









You shall consecrate them so they will be most holy, and whatever touches them will be holy. 



















###### 30 









"Anoint Aaron and his sons and consecrate them so they may serve me as priests. 



















###### 31 









Say to the Israelites, 'This is to be my sacred anointing oil for the generations to come. 



















###### 32 









Do not pour it on anyone else's body and do not make any other oil using the same formula. It is sacred, and you are to consider it sacred. 



















###### 33 









Whoever makes perfume like it and puts it on anyone other than a priest must be cut off from their people.'" ## Incense 



















###### 34 









Then the LORD said to Moses, "Take fragrant spices--gum resin, onycha and galbanum--and pure frankincense, all in equal amounts, 



















###### 35 









and make a fragrant blend of incense, the work of a perfumer. It is to be salted and pure and sacred. 



















###### 36 









Grind some of it to powder and place it in front of the ark of the covenant law in the tent of meeting, where I will meet with you. It shall be most holy to you. 



















###### 37 









Do not make any incense with this formula for yourselves; consider it holy to the LORD. 



















###### 38 









Whoever makes incense like it to enjoy its fragrance must be cut off from their people." NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

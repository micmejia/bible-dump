# Exodus 31

***




















###### 1 









Then the LORD said to Moses, 



















###### 2 









"See, I have chosen Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, 



















###### 3 









and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom, with understanding, with knowledge and with all kinds of skills-- 



















###### 4 









to make artistic designs for work in gold, silver and bronze, 



















###### 5 









to cut and set stones, to work in wood, and to engage in all kinds of crafts. 



















###### 6 









Moreover, I have appointed Oholiab son of Ahisamak, of the tribe of Dan, to help him. Also I have given ability to all the skilled workers to make everything I have commanded you: 



















###### 7 









the tent of meeting, the ark of the covenant law with the atonement cover on it, and all the other furnishings of the tent-- 



















###### 8 









the table and its articles, the pure gold lampstand and all its accessories, the altar of incense, 



















###### 9 









the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, the basin with its stand-- 



















###### 10 









and also the woven garments, both the sacred garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons when they serve as priests, 



















###### 11 









and the anointing oil and fragrant incense for the Holy Place. They are to make them just as I commanded you." ## The Sabbath 



















###### 12 









Then the LORD said to Moses, 



















###### 13 









"Say to the Israelites, 'You must observe my Sabbaths. This will be a sign between me and you for the generations to come, so you may know that I am the LORD, who makes you holy. 



















###### 14 









"'Observe the Sabbath, because it is holy to you. Anyone who desecrates it is to be put to death; those who do any work on that day must be cut off from their people. 



















###### 15 









For six days work is to be done, but the seventh day is a day of sabbath rest, holy to the LORD. Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day is to be put to death. 



















###### 16 









The Israelites are to observe the Sabbath, celebrating it for the generations to come as a lasting covenant. 



















###### 17 









It will be a sign between me and the Israelites forever, for in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day he rested and was refreshed.'" 



















###### 18 









When the LORD finished speaking to Moses on Mount Sinai, he gave him the two tablets of the covenant law, the tablets of stone inscribed by the finger of God.

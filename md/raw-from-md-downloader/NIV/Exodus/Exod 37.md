# Exodus 37

***




















###### 1 









Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood--two and a half cubits long, a cubit and a half wide, and a cubit and a half high.[^a] 



















###### 2 









He overlaid it with pure gold, both inside and out, and made a gold molding around it. 



















###### 3 









He cast four gold rings for it and fastened them to its four feet, with two rings on one side and two rings on the other. 



















###### 4 









Then he made poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold. 



















###### 5 









And he inserted the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark to carry it. 



















###### 6 









He made the atonement cover of pure gold--two and a half cubits long and a cubit and a half wide. 



















###### 7 









Then he made two cherubim out of hammered gold at the ends of the cover. 



















###### 8 









He made one cherub on one end and the second cherub on the other; at the two ends he made them of one piece with the cover. 



















###### 9 









The cherubim had their wings spread upward, overshadowing the cover with them. The cherubim faced each other, looking toward the cover. ## The Table 



















###### 10 









They[^b] made the table of acacia wood--two cubits long, a cubit wide and a cubit and a half high.[^c] 



















###### 11 









Then they overlaid it with pure gold and made a gold molding around it. 



















###### 12 









They also made around it a rim a handbreadth[^d] wide and put a gold molding on the rim. 



















###### 13 









They cast four gold rings for the table and fastened them to the four corners, where the four legs were. 



















###### 14 









The rings were put close to the rim to hold the poles used in carrying the table. 



















###### 15 









The poles for carrying the table were made of acacia wood and were overlaid with gold. 



















###### 16 









And they made from pure gold the articles for the table--its plates and dishes and bowls and its pitchers for the pouring out of drink offerings. ## The Lampstand 



















###### 17 









They made the lampstand of pure gold. They hammered out its base and shaft, and made its flowerlike cups, buds and blossoms of one piece with them. 



















###### 18 









Six branches extended from the sides of the lampstand--three on one side and three on the other. 



















###### 19 









Three cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms were on one branch, three on the next branch and the same for all six branches extending from the lampstand. 



















###### 20 









And on the lampstand were four cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms. 



















###### 21 









One bud was under the first pair of branches extending from the lampstand, a second bud under the second pair, and a third bud under the third pair--six branches in all. 



















###### 22 









The buds and the branches were all of one piece with the lampstand, hammered out of pure gold. 



















###### 23 









They made its seven lamps, as well as its wick trimmers and trays, of pure gold. 



















###### 24 









They made the lampstand and all its accessories from one talent[^e] of pure gold. ## The Altar of Incense 



















###### 25

###### 26 









They overlaid the top and all the sides and the horns with pure gold, and made a gold molding around it. 



















###### 27 









They made two gold rings below the molding--two on each of the opposite sides--to hold the poles used to carry it.

They made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.

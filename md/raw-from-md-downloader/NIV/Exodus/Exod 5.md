# Exodus 5

***




















###### 1 









Afterward Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'Let my people go, so that they may hold a festival to me in the wilderness.'" 



















###### 2 









Pharaoh said, "Who is the LORD, that I should obey him and let Israel go? I do not know the LORD and I will not let Israel go." 



















###### 3 









Then they said, "The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Now let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God, or he may strike us with plagues or with the sword." 



















###### 4 









But the king of Egypt said, "Moses and Aaron, why are you taking the people away from their labor? Get back to your work!" 



















###### 5 









Then Pharaoh said, "Look, the people of the land are now numerous, and you are stopping them from working." 



















###### 6 









That same day Pharaoh gave this order to the slave drivers and overseers in charge of the people: 



















###### 7 









"You are no longer to supply the people with straw for making bricks; let them go and gather their own straw. 



















###### 8 









But require them to make the same number of bricks as before; don't reduce the quota. They are lazy; that is why they are crying out, 'Let us go and sacrifice to our God.' 



















###### 9 









Make the work harder for the people so that they keep working and pay no attention to lies." 



















###### 10 









Then the slave drivers and the overseers went out and said to the people, "This is what Pharaoh says: 'I will not give you any more straw. 



















###### 11 









Go and get your own straw wherever you can find it, but your work will not be reduced at all.'" 



















###### 12 









So the people scattered all over Egypt to gather stubble to use for straw. 



















###### 13 









The slave drivers kept pressing them, saying, "Complete the work required of you for each day, just as when you had straw." 



















###### 14 









And Pharaoh's slave drivers beat the Israelite overseers they had appointed, demanding, "Why haven't you met your quota of bricks yesterday or today, as before?" 



















###### 15 









Then the Israelite overseers went and appealed to Pharaoh: "Why have you treated your servants this way? 



















###### 16 









Your servants are given no straw, yet we are told, 'Make bricks!' Your servants are being beaten, but the fault is with your own people." 



















###### 17 









Pharaoh said, "Lazy, that's what you are--lazy! That is why you keep saying, 'Let us go and sacrifice to the LORD.' 



















###### 18 









Now get to work. You will not be given any straw, yet you must produce your full quota of bricks." 



















###### 19 









The Israelite overseers realized they were in trouble when they were told, "You are not to reduce the number of bricks required of you for each day." 



















###### 20 









When they left Pharaoh, they found Moses and Aaron waiting to meet them, 



















###### 21 









and they said, "May the LORD look on you and judge you! You have made us obnoxious to Pharaoh and his officials and have put a sword in their hand to kill us." ## God Promises Deliverance 



















###### 22 









Moses returned to the LORD and said, "Why, Lord, why have you brought trouble on this people? Is this why you sent me? 



















###### 23 









Ever since I went to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble on this people, and you have not rescued your people at all."

# Ezekiel 1

***




















###### 1 









In my thirtieth year, in the fourth month on the fifth day, while I was among the exiles by the Kebar River, the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God. 



















###### 2 









On the fifth of the month--it was the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin-- 



















###### 3 









the word of the LORD came to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, by the Kebar River in the land of the Babylonians.[^a] There the hand of the LORD was on him. 



















###### 4 









I looked, and I saw a windstorm coming out of the north--an immense cloud with flashing lightning and surrounded by brilliant light. The center of the fire looked like glowing metal, 



















###### 5 









and in the fire was what looked like four living creatures. In appearance their form was human, 



















###### 6 









but each of them had four faces and four wings. 



















###### 7 









Their legs were straight; their feet were like those of a calf and gleamed like burnished bronze. 



















###### 8 









Under their wings on their four sides they had human hands. All four of them had faces and wings, 



















###### 9 









and the wings of one touched the wings of another. Each one went straight ahead; they did not turn as they moved. 



















###### 10 









Their faces looked like this: Each of the four had the face of a human being, and on the right side each had the face of a lion, and on the left the face of an ox; each also had the face of an eagle. 



















###### 11 









Such were their faces. They each had two wings spreading out upward, each wing touching that of the creature on either side; and each had two other wings covering its body. 



















###### 12 









Each one went straight ahead. Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, without turning as they went. 



















###### 13 









The appearance of the living creatures was like burning coals of fire or like torches. Fire moved back and forth among the creatures; it was bright, and lightning flashed out of it. 



















###### 14 









The creatures sped back and forth like flashes of lightning. 



















###### 15 









As I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground beside each creature with its four faces. 



















###### 16 









This was the appearance and structure of the wheels: They sparkled like topaz, and all four looked alike. Each appeared to be made like a wheel intersecting a wheel. 



















###### 17 









As they moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the creatures faced; the wheels did not change direction as the creatures went. 



















###### 18 









Their rims were high and awesome, and all four rims were full of eyes all around. 



















###### 19 









When the living creatures moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when the living creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose. 



















###### 20 









Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, and the wheels would rise along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. 



















###### 21 









When the creatures moved, they also moved; when the creatures stood still, they also stood still; and when the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels rose along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. 



















###### 22 









Spread out above the heads of the living creatures was what looked something like a vault, sparkling like crystal, and awesome. 



















###### 23 









Under the vault their wings were stretched out one toward the other, and each had two wings covering its body. 



















###### 24 









When the creatures moved, I heard the sound of their wings, like the roar of rushing waters, like the voice of the Almighty,[^b] like the tumult of an army. When they stood still, they lowered their wings. 



















###### 25 









Then there came a voice from above the vault over their heads as they stood with lowered wings. 



















###### 26 









Above the vault over their heads was what looked like a throne of lapis lazuli, and high above on the throne was a figure like that of a man. 



















###### 27 









I saw that from what appeared to be his waist up he looked like glowing metal, as if full of fire, and that from there down he looked like fire; and brilliant light surrounded him. 



















###### 28 









Like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day, so was the radiance around him. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. When I saw it, I fell facedown, and I heard the voice of one speaking. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

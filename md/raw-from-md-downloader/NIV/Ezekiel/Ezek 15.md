# Ezekiel 15

***




















###### 1 









The word of the LORD came to me: 



















###### 2 









"Son of man, how is the wood of a vine different from that of a branch from any of the trees in the forest? 



















###### 3 









Is wood ever taken from it to make anything useful? Do they make pegs from it to hang things on? 



















###### 4 









And after it is thrown on the fire as fuel and the fire burns both ends and chars the middle, is it then useful for anything? 



















###### 5 









If it was not useful for anything when it was whole, how much less can it be made into something useful when the fire has burned it and it is charred? 



















###### 6 









"Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: As I have given the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest as fuel for the fire, so will I treat the people living in Jerusalem. 



















###### 7 









I will set my face against them. Although they have come out of the fire, the fire will yet consume them. And when I set my face against them, you will know that I am the LORD. 



















###### 8 









I will make the land desolate because they have been unfaithful, declares the Sovereign LORD." NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

# Ezekiel 19

***




















###### 1 









"Take up a lament concerning the princes of Israel 



















###### 2 









and say: "'What a lioness was your mother among the lions! She lay down among them and reared her cubs. 



















###### 3 









She brought up one of her cubs, and he became a strong lion. He learned to tear the prey and he became a man-eater. 



















###### 4 









The nations heard about him, and he was trapped in their pit. They led him with hooks to the land of Egypt. 



















###### 5 









"'When she saw her hope unfulfilled, her expectation gone, she took another of her cubs and made him a strong lion. 



















###### 6 









He prowled among the lions, for he was now a strong lion. He learned to tear the prey and he became a man-eater. 



















###### 7 









He broke down[^a] their strongholds and devastated their towns. The land and all who were in it were terrified by his roaring. 



















###### 8 









Then the nations came against him, those from regions round about. They spread their net for him, and he was trapped in their pit. 



















###### 9 









With hooks they pulled him into a cage and brought him to the king of Babylon. They put him in prison, so his roar was heard no longer on the mountains of Israel. 



















###### 10 









"'Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard[^b] planted by the water; it was fruitful and full of branches because of abundant water. 



















###### 11 









Its branches were strong, fit for a ruler's scepter. It towered high above the thick foliage, conspicuous for its height and for its many branches. 



















###### 12 









But it was uprooted in fury and thrown to the ground. The east wind made it shrivel, it was stripped of its fruit; its strong branches withered and fire consumed them. 



















###### 13 









Now it is planted in the desert, in a dry and thirsty land. 



















###### 14 









Fire spread from one of its main[^c] branches and consumed its fruit. No strong branch is left on it fit for a ruler's scepter.' "This is a lament and is to be used as a lament."

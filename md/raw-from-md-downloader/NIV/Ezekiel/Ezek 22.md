# Ezekiel 22

***




















###### 1 









The word of the LORD came to me: 



















###### 2 









"Son of man, will you judge her? Will you judge this city of bloodshed? Then confront her with all her detestable practices 



















###### 3 









and say: 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: You city that brings on herself doom by shedding blood in her midst and defiles herself by making idols, 



















###### 4 









you have become guilty because of the blood you have shed and have become defiled by the idols you have made. You have brought your days to a close, and the end of your years has come. Therefore I will make you an object of scorn to the nations and a laughingstock to all the countries. 



















###### 5 









Those who are near and those who are far away will mock you, you infamous city, full of turmoil. 



















###### 6 









"'See how each of the princes of Israel who are in you uses his power to shed blood. 



















###### 7 









In you they have treated father and mother with contempt; in you they have oppressed the foreigner and mistreated the fatherless and the widow. 



















###### 8 









You have despised my holy things and desecrated my Sabbaths. 



















###### 9 









In you are slanderers who are bent on shedding blood; in you are those who eat at the mountain shrines and commit lewd acts. 



















###### 10 









In you are those who dishonor their father's bed; in you are those who violate women during their period, when they are ceremonially unclean. 



















###### 11 









In you one man commits a detestable offense with his neighbor's wife, another shamefully defiles his daughter-in-law, and another violates his sister, his own father's daughter. 



















###### 12 









In you are people who accept bribes to shed blood; you take interest and make a profit from the poor. You extort unjust gain from your neighbors. And you have forgotten me, declares the Sovereign LORD. 



















###### 13 









"'I will surely strike my hands together at the unjust gain you have made and at the blood you have shed in your midst. 



















###### 14 









Will your courage endure or your hands be strong in the day I deal with you? I the LORD have spoken, and I will do it. 



















###### 15 









I will disperse you among the nations and scatter you through the countries; and I will put an end to your uncleanness. 



















###### 16 









When you have been defiled[^a] in the eyes of the nations, you will know that I am the LORD.'" 



















###### 17 









Then the word of the LORD came to me: 



















###### 18 









"Son of man, the people of Israel have become dross to me; all of them are the copper, tin, iron and lead left inside a furnace. They are but the dross of silver. 



















###### 19 









Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: 'Because you have all become dross, I will gather you into Jerusalem. 



















###### 20 









As silver, copper, iron, lead and tin are gathered into a furnace to be melted with a fiery blast, so will I gather you in my anger and my wrath and put you inside the city and melt you. 



















###### 21 









I will gather you and I will blow on you with my fiery wrath, and you will be melted inside her. 



















###### 22 









As silver is melted in a furnace, so you will be melted inside her, and you will know that I the LORD have poured out my wrath on you.'" 



















###### 23 









Again the word of the LORD came to me: 



















###### 24 









"Son of man, say to the land, 'You are a land that has not been cleansed or rained on in the day of wrath.' 



















###### 25 









There is a conspiracy of her princes[^b] within her like a roaring lion tearing its prey; they devour people, take treasures and precious things and make many widows within her. 



















###### 26 









Her priests do violence to my law and profane my holy things; they do not distinguish between the holy and the common; they teach that there is no difference between the unclean and the clean; and they shut their eyes to the keeping of my Sabbaths, so that I am profaned among them. 



















###### 27 









Her officials within her are like wolves tearing their prey; they shed blood and kill people to make unjust gain. 



















###### 28 









Her prophets whitewash these deeds for them by false visions and lying divinations. They say, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says'--when the LORD has not spoken. 



















###### 29 









The people of the land practice extortion and commit robbery; they oppress the poor and needy and mistreat the foreigner, denying them justice. 



















###### 30 









"I looked for someone among them who would build up the wall and stand before me in the gap on behalf of the land so I would not have to destroy it, but I found no one. 



















###### 31 









So I will pour out my wrath on them and consume them with my fiery anger, bringing down on their own heads all they have done, declares the Sovereign LORD."

This will be for the consecrated priests, the Zadokites, who were faithful in serving me and did not go astray as the Levites did when the Israelites went astray. 



















###### 12 









It will be a special gift to them from the sacred portion of the land, a most holy portion, bordering the territory of the Levites. 



















###### 13 









"Alongside the territory of the priests, the Levites will have an allotment 25,000 cubits long and 10,000 cubits wide. Its total length will be 25,000 cubits and its width 10,000 cubits.

###### 15 









"The remaining area, 5,000 cubits[^c] wide and 25,000 cubits long, will be for the common use of the city, for houses and for pastureland. The city will be in the center of it

The pastureland for the city will be 250 cubits[^e] on the north, 250 cubits on the south, 250 cubits on the east, and 250 cubits on the west. 



















###### 18 









What remains of the area, bordering on the sacred portion and running the length of it, will be 10,000 cubits on the east side and 10,000 cubits on the west side. Its produce will supply food for the workers of the city. 



















###### 19 









The workers from the city who farm it will come from all the tribes of Israel. 



















###### 20 









The entire portion will be a square, 25,000 cubits on each side. As a special gift you will set aside the sacred portion, along with the property of the city. 



















###### 21 









"What remains on both sides of the area formed by the sacred portion and the property of the city will belong to the prince. It will extend eastward from the 25,000 cubits of the sacred portion to the eastern border, and westward from the 25,000 cubits to the western border. Both these areas running the length of the tribal portions will belong to the prince, and the sacred portion with the temple sanctuary will be in the center of them. 



















###### 22 









So the property of the Levites and the property of the city will lie in the center of the area that belongs to the prince. The area belonging to the prince will lie between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin.

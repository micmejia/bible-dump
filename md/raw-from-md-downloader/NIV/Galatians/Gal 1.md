# Galatians 1

***




















###### 1 









Paul, an apostle--sent not from men nor by a man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead-- 



















###### 2 









and all the brothers and sisters[^a] with me, To the churches in Galatia: 



















###### 3 









Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, 



















###### 4 









who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father, 



















###### 5 









to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. ## No Other Gospel 



















###### 6 









I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you to live in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel-- 



















###### 7 









which is really no gospel at all. Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ. 



















###### 8 









But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let them be under God's curse! 



















###### 9 









As we have already said, so now I say again: If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let them be under God's curse! 



















###### 10 









Am I now trying to win the approval of human beings, or of God? Or am I trying to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a servant of Christ. ## Paul Called by God 



















###### 11 









I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that the gospel I preached is not of human origin. 



















###### 12 









I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ. 



















###### 13 









For you have heard of my previous way of life in Judaism, how intensely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it. 



















###### 14 









I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers. 



















###### 15 









But when God, who set me apart from my mother's womb and called me by his grace, was pleased 



















###### 16 









to reveal his Son in me so that I might preach him among the Gentiles, my immediate response was not to consult any human being. 



















###### 17 









I did not go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before I was, but I went into Arabia. Later I returned to Damascus. 



















###### 18 









Then after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to get acquainted with Cephas[^b] and stayed with him fifteen days. 



















###### 19 









I saw none of the other apostles--only James, the Lord's brother. 



















###### 20 









I assure you before God that what I am writing you is no lie. 



















###### 21 









Then I went to Syria and Cilicia. 



















###### 22 









I was personally unknown to the churches of Judea that are in Christ. 



















###### 23 









They only heard the report: "The man who formerly persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy." 



















###### 24 









And they praised God because of me. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

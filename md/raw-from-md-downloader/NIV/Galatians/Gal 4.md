# Galatians 4

***




















###### 1 









What I am saying is that as long as an heir is underage, he is no different from a slave, although he owns the whole estate. 



















###### 2 









The heir is subject to guardians and trustees until the time set by his father. 



















###### 3 









So also, when we were underage, we were in slavery under the elemental spiritual forces[^a] of the world. 



















###### 4 









But when the set time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, 



















###### 5 









to redeem those under the law, that we might receive adoption to sonship.[^b] 



















###### 6 









Because you are his sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the Spirit who calls out, _"Abba_,[^c] Father." 



















###### 7 









So you are no longer a slave, but God's child; and since you are his child, God has made you also an heir. ## Paul's Concern for the Galatians 



















###### 8 









Formerly, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those who by nature are not gods. 



















###### 9 









But now that you know God--or rather are known by God--how is it that you are turning back to those weak and miserable forces[^d]? Do you wish to be enslaved by them all over again? 



















###### 10 









You are observing special days and months and seasons and years! 



















###### 11 









I fear for you, that somehow I have wasted my efforts on you. 



















###### 12 









I plead with you, brothers and sisters, become like me, for I became like you. You did me no wrong. 



















###### 13 









As you know, it was because of an illness that I first preached the gospel to you, 



















###### 14 









and even though my illness was a trial to you, you did not treat me with contempt or scorn. Instead, you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God, as if I were Christ Jesus himself. 



















###### 15 









Where, then, is your blessing of me now? I can testify that, if you could have done so, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me. 



















###### 16 









Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth? 



















###### 17 









Those people are zealous to win you over, but for no good. What they want is to alienate you from us, so that you may have zeal for them. 



















###### 18 









It is fine to be zealous, provided the purpose is good, and to be so always, not just when I am with you. 



















###### 19 









My dear children, for whom I am again in the pains of childbirth until Christ is formed in you, 



















###### 20 









how I wish I could be with you now and change my tone, because I am perplexed about you! ## Hagar and Sarah 



















###### 21 









Tell me, you who want to be under the law, are you not aware of what the law says? 



















###### 22 









For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman. 



















###### 23 









His son by the slave woman was born according to the flesh, but his son by the free woman was born as the result of a divine promise. 



















###### 24 









These things are being taken figuratively: The women represent two covenants. One covenant is from Mount Sinai and bears children who are to be slaves: This is Hagar. 



















###### 25 









Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present city of Jerusalem, because she is in slavery with her children. 



















###### 26 









But the Jerusalem that is above is free, and she is our mother. 



















###### 27 









For it is written: "Be glad, barren woman, you who never bore a child; shout for joy and cry aloud, you who were never in labor; because more are the children of the desolate woman than of her who has a husband."[^e] 



















###### 28 









Now you, brothers and sisters, like Isaac, are children of promise. 



















###### 29 









At that time the son born according to the flesh persecuted the son born by the power of the Spirit. It is the same now. 



















###### 30 









But what does Scripture say? "Get rid of the slave woman and her son, for the slave woman's son will never share in the inheritance with the free woman's son."[^f] 



















###### 31 









Therefore, brothers and sisters, we are not children of the slave woman, but of the free woman. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

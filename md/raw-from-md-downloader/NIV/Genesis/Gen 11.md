# Genesis 11

***




















###### 1 









Now the whole world had one language and a common speech. 



















###### 2 









As people moved eastward,[^a] they found a plain in Shinar[^b] and settled there. 



















###### 3 









They said to each other, "Come, let's make bricks and bake them thoroughly." They used brick instead of stone, and tar for mortar. 



















###### 4 









Then they said, "Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves; otherwise we will be scattered over the face of the whole earth." 



















###### 5 









But the LORD came down to see the city and the tower the people were building. 



















###### 6 









The LORD said, "If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them. 



















###### 7 









Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other." 



















###### 8 









So the LORD scattered them from there over all the earth, and they stopped building the city. 



















###### 9 









That is why it was called Babel[^c]--because there the LORD confused the language of the whole world. From there the LORD scattered them over the face of the whole earth. ## From Shem to Abram

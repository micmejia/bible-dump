# Genesis 15

***




















###### 1 









After this, the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision: "Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield,[^a] your very great reward.[^b]" 



















###### 2 









But Abram said, "Sovereign LORD, what can you give me since I remain childless and the one who will inherit[^c] my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?" 



















###### 3 









And Abram said, "You have given me no children; so a servant in my household will be my heir." 



















###### 4 









Then the word of the LORD came to him: "This man will not be your heir, but a son who is your own flesh and blood will be your heir." 



















###### 5 









He took him outside and said, "Look up at the sky and count the stars--if indeed you can count them." Then he said to him, "So shall your offspring[^d] be." 



















###### 6 









Abram believed the LORD, and he credited it to him as righteousness. 



















###### 7 









He also said to him, "I am the LORD, who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to take possession of it." 



















###### 8 









But Abram said, "Sovereign LORD, how can I know that I will gain possession of it?" 



















###### 9 









So the LORD said to him, "Bring me a heifer, a goat and a ram, each three years old, along with a dove and a young pigeon." 



















###### 10 









Abram brought all these to him, cut them in two and arranged the halves opposite each other; the birds, however, he did not cut in half. 



















###### 11 









Then birds of prey came down on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away. 



















###### 12 









As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and a thick and dreadful darkness came over him. 



















###### 13 









Then the LORD said to him, "Know for certain that for four hundred years your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own and that they will be enslaved and mistreated there. 



















###### 14 









But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves, and afterward they will come out with great possessions. 



















###### 15 









You, however, will go to your ancestors in peace and be buried at a good old age. 



















###### 16 









In the fourth generation your descendants will come back here, for the sin of the Amorites has not yet reached its full measure." 



















###### 17 









When the sun had set and darkness had fallen, a smoking firepot with a blazing torch appeared and passed between the pieces. 



















###### 18 









On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram and said, "To your descendants I give this land, from the Wadi[^e] of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates--

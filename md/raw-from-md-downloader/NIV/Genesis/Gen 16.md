# Genesis 16

***




















###### 1 









Now Sarai, Abram's wife, had borne him no children. But she had an Egyptian slave named Hagar; 



















###### 2 









so she said to Abram, "The LORD has kept me from having children. Go, sleep with my slave; perhaps I can build a family through her." Abram agreed to what Sarai said. 



















###### 3 









So after Abram had been living in Canaan ten years, Sarai his wife took her Egyptian slave Hagar and gave her to her husband to be his wife. 



















###### 4 









He slept with Hagar, and she conceived. When she knew she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress. 



















###### 5 









Then Sarai said to Abram, "You are responsible for the wrong I am suffering. I put my slave in your arms, and now that she knows she is pregnant, she despises me. May the LORD judge between you and me." 



















###### 6 









"Your slave is in your hands," Abram said. "Do with her whatever you think best." Then Sarai mistreated Hagar; so she fled from her. 



















###### 7 









The angel of the LORD found Hagar near a spring in the desert; it was the spring that is beside the road to Shur. 



















###### 8 









And he said, "Hagar, slave of Sarai, where have you come from, and where are you going?" "I'm running away from my mistress Sarai," she answered. 



















###### 9 









Then the angel of the LORD told her, "Go back to your mistress and submit to her." 



















###### 10 









The angel added, "I will increase your descendants so much that they will be too numerous to count." 



















###### 11 









The angel of the LORD also said to her: "You are now pregnant and you will give birth to a son. You shall name him Ishmael,[^a] for the LORD has heard of your misery. 



















###### 12 









He will be a wild donkey of a man; his hand will be against everyone and everyone's hand against him, and he will live in hostility toward[^b] all his brothers." 



















###### 13 









She gave this name to the LORD who spoke to her: "You are the God who sees me," for she said, "I have now seen[^c] the One who sees me." 



















###### 14 









That is why the well was called Beer Lahai Roi[^d]; it is still there, between Kadesh and Bered. 



















###### 15 









So Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram gave the name Ishmael to the son she had borne. 



















###### 16 









Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore him Ishmael. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

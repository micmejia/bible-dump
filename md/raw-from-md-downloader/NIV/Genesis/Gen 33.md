# Genesis 33

***




















###### 1 









Jacob looked up and there was Esau, coming with his four hundred men; so he divided the children among Leah, Rachel and the two female servants. 



















###### 2 









He put the female servants and their children in front, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph in the rear. 



















###### 3 









He himself went on ahead and bowed down to the ground seven times as he approached his brother. 



















###### 4 









But Esau ran to meet Jacob and embraced him; he threw his arms around his neck and kissed him. And they wept. 



















###### 5 









Then Esau looked up and saw the women and children. "Who are these with you?" he asked. Jacob answered, "They are the children God has graciously given your servant." 



















###### 6 









Then the female servants and their children approached and bowed down. 



















###### 7 









Next, Leah and her children came and bowed down. Last of all came Joseph and Rachel, and they too bowed down. 



















###### 8 









Esau asked, "What's the meaning of all these flocks and herds I met?" "To find favor in your eyes, my lord," he said. 



















###### 9 









But Esau said, "I already have plenty, my brother. Keep what you have for yourself." 



















###### 10 









"No, please!" said Jacob. "If I have found favor in your eyes, accept this gift from me. For to see your face is like seeing the face of God, now that you have received me favorably. 



















###### 11 









Please accept the present that was brought to you, for God has been gracious to me and I have all I need." And because Jacob insisted, Esau accepted it. 



















###### 12 









Then Esau said, "Let us be on our way; I'll accompany you." 



















###### 13 









But Jacob said to him, "My lord knows that the children are tender and that I must care for the ewes and cows that are nursing their young. If they are driven hard just one day, all the animals will die. 



















###### 14 









So let my lord go on ahead of his servant, while I move along slowly at the pace of the flocks and herds before me and the pace of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir." 



















###### 15 









Esau said, "Then let me leave some of my men with you." "But why do that?" Jacob asked. "Just let me find favor in the eyes of my lord." 



















###### 16 









So that day Esau started on his way back to Seir. 



















###### 17 









Jacob, however, went to Sukkoth, where he built a place for himself and made shelters for his livestock. That is why the place is called Sukkoth.[^a] 



















###### 18 









After Jacob came from Paddan Aram,[^b] he arrived safely at the city of Shechem in Canaan and camped within sight of the city. 



















###### 19 









For a hundred pieces of silver,[^c] he bought from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem, the plot of ground where he pitched his tent. 



















###### 20 









There he set up an altar and called it El Elohe Israel.[^d] NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

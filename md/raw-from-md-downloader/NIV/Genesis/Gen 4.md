# Genesis 4

***




















###### 1 









Adam[^a] made love to his wife Eve, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain.[^b] She said, "With the help of the LORD I have brought forth[^c] a man." 



















###### 2 









Later she gave birth to his brother Abel. Now Abel kept flocks, and Cain worked the soil. 



















###### 3 









In the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the LORD. 



















###### 4 









And Abel also brought an offering--fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock. The LORD looked with favor on Abel and his offering, 



















###### 5 









but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favor. So Cain was very angry, and his face was downcast. 



















###### 6 









Then the LORD said to Cain, "Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast? 



















###### 7 









If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must rule over it." 



















###### 8 









Now Cain said to his brother Abel, "Let's go out to the field."[^d] While they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him. 



















###### 9 









Then the LORD said to Cain, "Where is your brother Abel?" "I don't know," he replied. "Am I my brother's keeper?" 



















###### 10 









The LORD said, "What have you done? Listen! Your brother's blood cries out to me from the ground. 



















###### 11 









Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand. 



















###### 12 









When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth." 



















###### 13 









Cain said to the LORD, "My punishment is more than I can bear. 



















###### 14 









Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me." 



















###### 15 









But the LORD said to him, "Not so[^e]; anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over." Then the LORD put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him. 



















###### 16 









So Cain went out from the LORD's presence and lived in the land of Nod,[^f] east of Eden. 



















###### 17 









Cain made love to his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Cain was then building a city, and he named it after his son Enoch. 



















###### 18 









To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael was the father of Methushael, and Methushael was the father of Lamech. 



















###### 19 









Lamech married two women, one named Adah and the other Zillah. 



















###### 20 









Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who live in tents and raise livestock. 



















###### 21 









His brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all who play stringed instruments and pipes. 



















###### 22 









Zillah also had a son, Tubal-Cain, who forged all kinds of tools out of[^g] bronze and iron. Tubal-Cain's sister was Naamah. 



















###### 23 









Lamech said to his wives, "Adah and Zillah, listen to me; wives of Lamech, hear my words. I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for injuring me. 



















###### 24 









If Cain is avenged seven times, then Lamech seventy-seven times." 



















###### 25 









Adam made love to his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth,[^h] saying, "God has granted me another child in place of Abel, since Cain killed him." 



















###### 26 









Seth also had a son, and he named him Enosh. At that time people began to call on[^i] the name of the LORD. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

###### 3 









"Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might, the first sign of my strength, excelling in honor, excelling in power. 



















###### 4

###### 5 









"Simeon and Levi are brothers-- their swords[^a] are weapons of violence. 



















###### 6 









Let me not enter their council, let me not join their assembly, for they have killed men in their anger and hamstrung oxen as they pleased. 



















###### 7 









Cursed be their anger, so fierce, and their fury, so cruel! I will scatter them in Jacob and disperse them in Israel. 



















###### 8 









"Judah,[^b] your brothers will praise you; your hand will be on the neck of your enemies; your father's sons will bow down to you. 



















###### 9 









You are a lion's cub, Judah; you return from the prey, my son. Like a lion he crouches and lies down, like a lioness--who dares to rouse him? 



















###### 10 









The scepter will not depart from Judah, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet,[^c] until he to whom it belongs[^d] shall come and the obedience of the nations shall be his. 



















###### 11 









He will tether his donkey to a vine, his colt to the choicest branch; he will wash his garments in wine, his robes in the blood of grapes. 



















###### 12

###### 13 









"Zebulun will live by the seashore and become a haven for ships; his border will extend toward Sidon. 



















###### 14 









"Issachar is a rawboned[^f] donkey lying down among the sheep pens.[^g] 



















###### 15

###### 16 









"Dan[^h] will provide justice for his people as one of the tribes of Israel. 



















###### 17 









Dan will be a snake by the roadside, a viper along the path, that bites the horse's heels so that its rider tumbles backward. 



















###### 18 









"I look for your deliverance, LORD. 



















###### 19 









"Gad[^i] will be attacked by a band of raiders, but he will attack them at their heels. 



















###### 20 









"Asher's food will be rich; he will provide delicacies fit for a king. 



















###### 21 









"Naphtali is a doe set free that bears beautiful fawns.[^j] 



















###### 22 









"Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine near a spring, whose branches climb over a wall.[^k]

###### 25 









because of your father's God, who helps you, because of the Almighty,[^m] who blesses you with blessings of the skies above, blessings of the deep springs below, blessings of the breast and womb. 



















###### 26

###### 27 









"Benjamin is a ravenous wolf; in the morning he devours the prey, in the evening he divides the plunder." 



















###### 28 









All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father said to them when he blessed them, giving each the blessing appropriate to him. ## The Death of Jacob

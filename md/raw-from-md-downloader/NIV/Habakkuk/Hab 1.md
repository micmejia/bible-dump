***




















###### 1 









The prophecy that Habakkuk the prophet received. ## Habakkuk's Complaint 



















###### 2 









How long, LORD, must I call for help, but you do not listen? Or cry out to you, "Violence!" but you do not save? 



















###### 3 









Why do you make me look at injustice? Why do you tolerate wrongdoing? Destruction and violence are before me; there is strife, and conflict abounds. 



















###### 4 









Therefore the law is paralyzed, and justice never prevails. The wicked hem in the righteous, so that justice is perverted. ## The LORD's Answer 



















###### 5 









"Look at the nations and watch-- and be utterly amazed. For I am going to do something in your days that you would not believe, even if you were told. 



















###### 6 









I am raising up the Babylonians,[^a] that ruthless and impetuous people, who sweep across the whole earth to seize dwellings not their own. 



















###### 7 









They are a feared and dreaded people; they are a law to themselves and promote their own honor. 



















###### 8 









Their horses are swifter than leopards, fiercer than wolves at dusk. Their cavalry gallops headlong; their horsemen come from afar. They fly like an eagle swooping to devour; 



















###### 9 









they all come intent on violence. Their hordes[^b] advance like a desert wind and gather prisoners like sand. 



















###### 10 









They mock kings and scoff at rulers. They laugh at all fortified cities; by building earthen ramps they capture them. 



















###### 11 









Then they sweep past like the wind and go on-- guilty people, whose own strength is their god." ## Habakkuk's Second Complaint 



















###### 12 









LORD, are you not from everlasting? My God, my Holy One, you[^c] will never die. You, LORD, have appointed them to execute judgment; you, my Rock, have ordained them to punish. 



















###### 13 









Your eyes are too pure to look on evil; you cannot tolerate wrongdoing. Why then do you tolerate the treacherous? Why are you silent while the wicked swallow up those more righteous than themselves? 



















###### 14 









You have made people like the fish in the sea, like the sea creatures that have no ruler. 



















###### 15 









The wicked foe pulls all of them up with hooks, he catches them in his net, he gathers them up in his dragnet; and so he rejoices and is glad. 



















###### 16 









Therefore he sacrifices to his net and burns incense to his dragnet, for by his net he lives in luxury and enjoys the choicest food. 



















###### 17 









Is he to keep on emptying his net, destroying nations without mercy? NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

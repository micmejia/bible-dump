# Hebrews 3

***




















###### 1 









Therefore, holy brothers and sisters, who share in the heavenly calling, fix your thoughts on Jesus, whom we acknowledge as our apostle and high priest. 



















###### 2 









He was faithful to the one who appointed him, just as Moses was faithful in all God's house. 



















###### 3 









Jesus has been found worthy of greater honor than Moses, just as the builder of a house has greater honor than the house itself. 



















###### 4 









For every house is built by someone, but God is the builder of everything. 



















###### 5 









"Moses was faithful as a servant in all God's house,"[^a] bearing witness to what would be spoken by God in the future. 



















###### 6 









But Christ is faithful as the Son over God's house. And we are his house, if indeed we hold firmly to our confidence and the hope in which we glory. ## Warning Against Unbelief 



















###### 7 









So, as the Holy Spirit says: "Today, if you hear his voice, 



















###### 8 









do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion, during the time of testing in the wilderness, 



















###### 9 









where your ancestors tested and tried me, though for forty years they saw what I did. 



















###### 10 









That is why I was angry with that generation; I said, 'Their hearts are always going astray, and they have not known my ways.' 



















###### 11 









So I declared on oath in my anger, 'They shall never enter my rest.' "[^b] 



















###### 12 









See to it, brothers and sisters, that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God. 



















###### 13 









But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called "Today," so that none of you may be hardened by sin's deceitfulness. 



















###### 14 









We have come to share in Christ, if indeed we hold our original conviction firmly to the very end. 



















###### 15 









As has just been said: "Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion."[^c] 



















###### 16 









Who were they who heard and rebelled? Were they not all those Moses led out of Egypt? 



















###### 17 









And with whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies perished in the wilderness? 



















###### 18 









And to whom did God swear that they would never enter his rest if not to those who disobeyed? 



















###### 19 









So we see that they were not able to enter, because of their unbelief. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

# Hosea 10

***




















###### 1 









Israel was a spreading vine; he brought forth fruit for himself. As his fruit increased, he built more altars; as his land prospered, he adorned his sacred stones. 



















###### 2 









Their heart is deceitful, and now they must bear their guilt. The LORD will demolish their altars and destroy their sacred stones. 



















###### 3 









Then they will say, "We have no king because we did not revere the LORD. But even if we had a king, what could he do for us?" 



















###### 4 









They make many promises, take false oaths and make agreements; therefore lawsuits spring up like poisonous weeds in a plowed field. 



















###### 5 









The people who live in Samaria fear for the calf-idol of Beth Aven.[^a] Its people will mourn over it, and so will its idolatrous priests, those who had rejoiced over its splendor, because it is taken from them into exile. 



















###### 6 









It will be carried to Assyria as tribute for the great king. Ephraim will be disgraced; Israel will be ashamed of its foreign alliances. 



















###### 7 









Samaria's king will be destroyed, swept away like a twig on the surface of the waters. 



















###### 8 









The high places of wickedness[^b] will be destroyed-- it is the sin of Israel. Thorns and thistles will grow up and cover their altars. Then they will say to the mountains, "Cover us!" and to the hills, "Fall on us!" 



















###### 9 









"Since the days of Gibeah, you have sinned, Israel, and there you have remained.[^c] Will not war again overtake the evildoers in Gibeah? 



















###### 10 









When I please, I will punish them; nations will be gathered against them to put them in bonds for their double sin. 



















###### 11 









Ephraim is a trained heifer that loves to thresh; so I will put a yoke on her fair neck. I will drive Ephraim, Judah must plow, and Jacob must break up the ground. 



















###### 12 









Sow righteousness for yourselves, reap the fruit of unfailing love, and break up your unplowed ground; for it is time to seek the LORD, until he comes and showers his righteousness on you. 



















###### 13 









But you have planted wickedness, you have reaped evil, you have eaten the fruit of deception. Because you have depended on your own strength and on your many warriors, 



















###### 14 









the roar of battle will rise against your people, so that all your fortresses will be devastated-- as Shalman devastated Beth Arbel on the day of battle, when mothers were dashed to the ground with their children. 



















###### 15 









So will it happen to you, Bethel, because your wickedness is great. When that day dawns, the king of Israel will be completely destroyed.

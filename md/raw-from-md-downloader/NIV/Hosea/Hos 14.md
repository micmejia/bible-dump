# Hosea 14

***




















###### 1 









[^a]Return, Israel, to the LORD your God. Your sins have been your downfall! 



















###### 2 









Take words with you and return to the LORD. Say to him: "Forgive all our sins and receive us graciously, that we may offer the fruit of our lips.[^b] 



















###### 3 









Assyria cannot save us; we will not mount warhorses. We will never again say 'Our gods' to what our own hands have made, for in you the fatherless find compassion." 



















###### 4 









"I will heal their waywardness and love them freely, for my anger has turned away from them. 



















###### 5 









I will be like the dew to Israel; he will blossom like a lily. Like a cedar of Lebanon he will send down his roots; 



















###### 6 









his young shoots will grow. His splendor will be like an olive tree, his fragrance like a cedar of Lebanon. 



















###### 7 









People will dwell again in his shade; they will flourish like the grain, they will blossom like the vine-- Israel's fame will be like the wine of Lebanon. 



















###### 8 









Ephraim, what more have I[^c] to do with idols? I will answer him and care for him. I am like a flourishing juniper; your fruitfulness comes from me." 



















###### 9 









Who is wise? Let them realize these things. Who is discerning? Let them understand. The ways of the LORD are right; the righteous walk in them, but the rebellious stumble in them.

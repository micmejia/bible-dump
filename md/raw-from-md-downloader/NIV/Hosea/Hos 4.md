# Hosea 4

***




















###### 1 









Hear the word of the LORD, you Israelites, because the LORD has a charge to bring against you who live in the land: "There is no faithfulness, no love, no acknowledgment of God in the land. 



















###### 2 









There is only cursing,[^a] lying and murder, stealing and adultery; they break all bounds, and bloodshed follows bloodshed. 



















###### 3 









Because of this the land dries up, and all who live in it waste away; the beasts of the field, the birds in the sky and the fish in the sea are swept away. 



















###### 4 









"But let no one bring a charge, let no one accuse another, for your people are like those who bring charges against a priest. 



















###### 5 









You stumble day and night, and the prophets stumble with you. So I will destroy your mother-- 



















###### 6 









my people are destroyed from lack of knowledge. "Because you have rejected knowledge, I also reject you as my priests; because you have ignored the law of your God, I also will ignore your children. 



















###### 7 









The more priests there were, the more they sinned against me; they exchanged their glorious God[^b] for something disgraceful. 



















###### 8 









They feed on the sins of my people and relish their wickedness. 



















###### 9 









And it will be: Like people, like priests. I will punish both of them for their ways and repay them for their deeds. 



















###### 10 









"They will eat but not have enough; they will engage in prostitution but not flourish, because they have deserted the LORD to give themselves <sup class="versenum mid-line">11</sup>to prostitution; old wine and new wine take away their understanding. 



















###### 12 









My people consult a wooden idol, and a diviner's rod speaks to them. A spirit of prostitution leads them astray; they are unfaithful to their God. 



















###### 13 









They sacrifice on the mountaintops and burn offerings on the hills, under oak, poplar and terebinth, where the shade is pleasant. Therefore your daughters turn to prostitution and your daughters-in-law to adultery. 



















###### 14 









"I will not punish your daughters when they turn to prostitution, nor your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery, because the men themselves consort with harlots and sacrifice with shrine prostitutes-- a people without understanding will come to ruin! 



















###### 15 









"Though you, Israel, commit adultery, do not let Judah become guilty. "Do not go to Gilgal; do not go up to Beth Aven.[^c] And do not swear, 'As surely as the LORD lives!' 



















###### 16 









The Israelites are stubborn, like a stubborn heifer. How then can the LORD pasture them like lambs in a meadow? 



















###### 17 









Ephraim is joined to idols; leave him alone! 



















###### 18 









Even when their drinks are gone, they continue their prostitution; their rulers dearly love shameful ways. 



















###### 19 









A whirlwind will sweep them away, and their sacrifices will bring them shame. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

# Hosea 6

***




















###### 1 









"Come, let us return to the LORD. He has torn us to pieces but he will heal us; he has injured us but he will bind up our wounds. 



















###### 2 









After two days he will revive us; on the third day he will restore us, that we may live in his presence. 



















###### 3 









Let us acknowledge the LORD; let us press on to acknowledge him. As surely as the sun rises, he will appear; he will come to us like the winter rains, like the spring rains that water the earth." 



















###### 4 









"What can I do with you, Ephraim? What can I do with you, Judah? Your love is like the morning mist, like the early dew that disappears. 



















###### 5 









Therefore I cut you in pieces with my prophets, I killed you with the words of my mouth-- then my judgments go forth like the sun.[^a] 



















###### 6 









For I desire mercy, not sacrifice, and acknowledgment of God rather than burnt offerings. 



















###### 7 









As at Adam,[^b] they have broken the covenant; they were unfaithful to me there. 



















###### 8 









Gilead is a city of evildoers, stained with footprints of blood. 



















###### 9 









As marauders lie in ambush for a victim, so do bands of priests; they murder on the road to Shechem, carrying out their wicked schemes. 



















###### 10 









I have seen a horrible thing in Israel: There Ephraim is given to prostitution, Israel is defiled. 



















###### 11

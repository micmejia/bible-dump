# Isaiah 1

***




















###### 1 









The vision concerning Judah and Jerusalem that Isaiah son of Amoz saw during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. ## A Rebellious Nation 



















###### 2 









Hear me, you heavens! Listen, earth! For the LORD has spoken: "I reared children and brought them up, but they have rebelled against me. 



















###### 3 









The ox knows its master, the donkey its owner's manger, but Israel does not know, my people do not understand." 



















###### 4 









Woe to the sinful nation, a people whose guilt is great, a brood of evildoers, children given to corruption! They have forsaken the LORD; they have spurned the Holy One of Israel and turned their backs on him. 



















###### 5 









Why should you be beaten anymore? Why do you persist in rebellion? Your whole head is injured, your whole heart afflicted. 



















###### 6 









From the sole of your foot to the top of your head there is no soundness-- only wounds and welts and open sores, not cleansed or bandaged or soothed with olive oil. 



















###### 7 









Your country is desolate, your cities burned with fire; your fields are being stripped by foreigners right before you, laid waste as when overthrown by strangers. 



















###### 8 









Daughter Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard, like a hut in a cucumber field, like a city under siege. 



















###### 9 









Unless the LORD Almighty had left us some survivors, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah. 



















###### 10 









Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom; listen to the instruction of our God, you people of Gomorrah! 



















###### 11 









"The multitude of your sacrifices-- what are they to me?" says the LORD. "I have more than enough of burnt offerings, of rams and the fat of fattened animals; I have no pleasure in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats. 



















###### 12 









When you come to appear before me, who has asked this of you, this trampling of my courts? 



















###### 13 









Stop bringing meaningless offerings! Your incense is detestable to me. New Moons, Sabbaths and convocations-- I cannot bear your worthless assemblies. 



















###### 14 









Your New Moon feasts and your appointed festivals I hate with all my being. They have become a burden to me; I am weary of bearing them. 



















###### 15 









When you spread out your hands in prayer, I hide my eyes from you; even when you offer many prayers, I am not listening. Your hands are full of blood! 



















###### 16 









Wash and make yourselves clean. Take your evil deeds out of my sight; stop doing wrong. 



















###### 17 









Learn to do right; seek justice. Defend the oppressed.[^a] Take up the cause of the fatherless; plead the case of the widow. 



















###### 18 









"Come now, let us settle the matter," says the LORD. "Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool. 



















###### 19 









If you are willing and obedient, you will eat the good things of the land; 



















###### 20 









but if you resist and rebel, you will be devoured by the sword." For the mouth of the LORD has spoken. 



















###### 21 









See how the faithful city has become a prostitute! She once was full of justice; righteousness used to dwell in her-- but now murderers! 



















###### 22 









Your silver has become dross, your choice wine is diluted with water. 



















###### 23 









Your rulers are rebels, partners with thieves; they all love bribes and chase after gifts. They do not defend the cause of the fatherless; the widow's case does not come before them. 



















###### 24 









Therefore the Lord, the LORD Almighty, the Mighty One of Israel, declares: "Ah! I will vent my wrath on my foes and avenge myself on my enemies. 



















###### 25 









I will turn my hand against you;[^b] I will thoroughly purge away your dross and remove all your impurities. 



















###### 26 









I will restore your leaders as in days of old, your rulers as at the beginning. Afterward you will be called the City of Righteousness, the Faithful City." 



















###### 27 









Zion will be delivered with justice, her penitent ones with righteousness. 



















###### 28 









But rebels and sinners will both be broken, and those who forsake the LORD will perish. 



















###### 29 









"You will be ashamed because of the sacred oaks in which you have delighted; you will be disgraced because of the gardens that you have chosen. 



















###### 30 









You will be like an oak with fading leaves, like a garden without water. 



















###### 31 









The mighty man will become tinder and his work a spark; both will burn together, with no one to quench the fire." NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

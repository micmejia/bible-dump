# Isaiah 13

***




















###### 1 









A prophecy against Babylon that Isaiah son of Amoz saw: 



















###### 2 









Raise a banner on a bare hilltop, shout to them; beckon to them to enter the gates of the nobles. 



















###### 3 









I have commanded those I prepared for battle; I have summoned my warriors to carry out my wrath-- those who rejoice in my triumph. 



















###### 4 









Listen, a noise on the mountains, like that of a great multitude! Listen, an uproar among the kingdoms, like nations massing together! The LORD Almighty is mustering an army for war. 



















###### 5 









They come from faraway lands, from the ends of the heavens-- the LORD and the weapons of his wrath-- to destroy the whole country. 



















###### 6 









Wail, for the day of the LORD is near; it will come like destruction from the Almighty.[^a] 



















###### 7 









Because of this, all hands will go limp, every heart will melt with fear. 



















###### 8 









Terror will seize them, pain and anguish will grip them; they will writhe like a woman in labor. They will look aghast at each other, their faces aflame. 



















###### 9 









See, the day of the LORD is coming --a cruel day, with wrath and fierce anger-- to make the land desolate and destroy the sinners within it. 



















###### 10 









The stars of heaven and their constellations will not show their light. The rising sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light. 



















###### 11 









I will punish the world for its evil, the wicked for their sins. I will put an end to the arrogance of the haughty and will humble the pride of the ruthless. 



















###### 12 









I will make people scarcer than pure gold, more rare than the gold of Ophir. 



















###### 13 









Therefore I will make the heavens tremble; and the earth will shake from its place at the wrath of the LORD Almighty, in the day of his burning anger. 



















###### 14 









Like a hunted gazelle, like sheep without a shepherd, they will all return to their own people, they will flee to their native land. 



















###### 15 









Whoever is captured will be thrust through; all who are caught will fall by the sword. 



















###### 16 









Their infants will be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses will be looted and their wives violated. 



















###### 17 









See, I will stir up against them the Medes, who do not care for silver and have no delight in gold. 



















###### 18 









Their bows will strike down the young men; they will have no mercy on infants, nor will they look with compassion on children. 



















###### 19 









Babylon, the jewel of kingdoms, the pride and glory of the Babylonians,[^b] will be overthrown by God like Sodom and Gomorrah. 



















###### 20 









She will never be inhabited or lived in through all generations; there no nomads will pitch their tents, there no shepherds will rest their flocks. 



















###### 21 









But desert creatures will lie there, jackals will fill her houses; there the owls will dwell, and there the wild goats will leap about. 



















###### 22 









Hyenas will inhabit her strongholds, jackals her luxurious palaces. Her time is at hand, and her days will not be prolonged. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

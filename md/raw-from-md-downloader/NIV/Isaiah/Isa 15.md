# Isaiah 15

***




















###### 1 









A prophecy against Moab: Ar in Moab is ruined, destroyed in a night! Kir in Moab is ruined, destroyed in a night! 



















###### 2 









Dibon goes up to its temple, to its high places to weep; Moab wails over Nebo and Medeba. Every head is shaved and every beard cut off. 



















###### 3 









In the streets they wear sackcloth; on the roofs and in the public squares they all wail, prostrate with weeping. 



















###### 4 









Heshbon and Elealeh cry out, their voices are heard all the way to Jahaz. Therefore the armed men of Moab cry out, and their hearts are faint. 



















###### 5 









My heart cries out over Moab; her fugitives flee as far as Zoar, as far as Eglath Shelishiyah. They go up the hill to Luhith, weeping as they go; on the road to Horonaim they lament their destruction. 



















###### 6 









The waters of Nimrim are dried up and the grass is withered; the vegetation is gone and nothing green is left. 



















###### 7 









So the wealth they have acquired and stored up they carry away over the Ravine of the Poplars. 



















###### 8 









Their outcry echoes along the border of Moab; their wailing reaches as far as Eglaim, their lamentation as far as Beer Elim. 



















###### 9 









The waters of Dimon[^a] are full of blood, but I will bring still more upon Dimon[^b]-- a lion upon the fugitives of Moab and upon those who remain in the land.

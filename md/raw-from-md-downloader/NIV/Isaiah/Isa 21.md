# Isaiah 21

***




















###### 1 









A prophecy against the Desert by the Sea: Like whirlwinds sweeping through the southland, an invader comes from the desert, from a land of terror. 



















###### 2 









A dire vision has been shown to me: The traitor betrays, the looter takes loot. Elam, attack! Media, lay siege! I will bring to an end all the groaning she caused. 



















###### 3 









At this my body is racked with pain, pangs seize me, like those of a woman in labor; I am staggered by what I hear, I am bewildered by what I see. 



















###### 4 









My heart falters, fear makes me tremble; the twilight I longed for has become a horror to me. 



















###### 5 









They set the tables, they spread the rugs, they eat, they drink! Get up, you officers, oil the shields! 



















###### 6 









This is what the Lord says to me: "Go, post a lookout and have him report what he sees. 



















###### 7 









When he sees chariots with teams of horses, riders on donkeys or riders on camels, let him be alert, fully alert." 



















###### 8 









And the lookout[^a] shouted, "Day after day, my lord, I stand on the watchtower; every night I stay at my post. 



















###### 9 









Look, here comes a man in a chariot with a team of horses. And he gives back the answer: 'Babylon has fallen, has fallen! All the images of its gods lie shattered on the ground!'" 



















###### 10 









My people who are crushed on the threshing floor, I tell you what I have heard from the LORD Almighty, from the God of Israel. ## A Prophecy Against Edom 



















###### 11 









A prophecy against Dumah[^b]: Someone calls to me from Seir, "Watchman, what is left of the night? Watchman, what is left of the night?" 



















###### 12 









The watchman replies, "Morning is coming, but also the night. If you would ask, then ask; and come back yet again." ## A Prophecy Against Arabia 



















###### 13 









A prophecy against Arabia: You caravans of Dedanites, who camp in the thickets of Arabia, 



















###### 14 









bring water for the thirsty; you who live in Tema, bring food for the fugitives. 



















###### 15 









They flee from the sword, from the drawn sword, from the bent bow and from the heat of battle. 



















###### 16 









This is what the Lord says to me: "Within one year, as a servant bound by contract would count it, all the splendor of Kedar will come to an end. 



















###### 17 









The survivors of the archers, the warriors of Kedar, will be few." The LORD, the God of Israel, has spoken. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

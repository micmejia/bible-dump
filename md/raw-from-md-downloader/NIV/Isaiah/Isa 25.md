# Isaiah 25

***




















###### 1 









LORD, you are my God; I will exalt you and praise your name, for in perfect faithfulness you have done wonderful things, things planned long ago. 



















###### 2 









You have made the city a heap of rubble, the fortified town a ruin, the foreigners' stronghold a city no more; it will never be rebuilt. 



















###### 3 









Therefore strong peoples will honor you; cities of ruthless nations will revere you. 



















###### 4 









You have been a refuge for the poor, a refuge for the needy in their distress, a shelter from the storm and a shade from the heat. For the breath of the ruthless is like a storm driving against a wall 



















###### 5 









and like the heat of the desert. You silence the uproar of foreigners; as heat is reduced by the shadow of a cloud, so the song of the ruthless is stilled. 



















###### 6 









On this mountain the LORD Almighty will prepare a feast of rich food for all peoples, a banquet of aged wine-- the best of meats and the finest of wines. 



















###### 7 









On this mountain he will destroy the shroud that enfolds all peoples, the sheet that covers all nations; 



















###### 8 









he will swallow up death forever. The Sovereign LORD will wipe away the tears from all faces; he will remove his people's disgrace from all the earth. The LORD has spoken. 



















###### 9 









In that day they will say, "Surely this is our God; we trusted in him, and he saved us. This is the LORD, we trusted in him; let us rejoice and be glad in his salvation." 



















###### 10 









The hand of the LORD will rest on this mountain; but Moab will be trampled in their land as straw is trampled down in the manure. 



















###### 11 









They will stretch out their hands in it, as swimmers stretch out their hands to swim. God will bring down their pride despite the cleverness[^a] of their hands. 



















###### 12 









He will bring down your high fortified walls and lay them low; he will bring them down to the ground, to the very dust. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

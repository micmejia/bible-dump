# Isaiah 27

***




















###### 1 









In that day, the LORD will punish with his sword-- his fierce, great and powerful sword-- Leviathan the gliding serpent, Leviathan the coiling serpent; he will slay the monster of the sea. 



















###### 2 









In that day-- "Sing about a fruitful vineyard: 



















###### 3 









I, the LORD, watch over it; I water it continually. I guard it day and night so that no one may harm it. 



















###### 4 









I am not angry. If only there were briers and thorns confronting me! I would march against them in battle; I would set them all on fire. 



















###### 5 









Or else let them come to me for refuge; let them make peace with me, yes, let them make peace with me." 



















###### 6 









In days to come Jacob will take root, Israel will bud and blossom and fill all the world with fruit. 



















###### 7 









Has the LORD struck her as he struck down those who struck her? Has she been killed as those were killed who killed her? 



















###### 8 









By warfare[^a] and exile you contend with her-- with his fierce blast he drives her out, as on a day the east wind blows. 



















###### 9 









By this, then, will Jacob's guilt be atoned for, and this will be the full fruit of the removal of his sin: When he makes all the altar stones to be like limestone crushed to pieces, no Asherah poles[^b] or incense altars will be left standing. 



















###### 10 









The fortified city stands desolate, an abandoned settlement, forsaken like the wilderness; there the calves graze, there they lie down; they strip its branches bare. 



















###### 11 









When its twigs are dry, they are broken off and women come and make fires with them. For this is a people without understanding; so their Maker has no compassion on them, and their Creator shows them no favor. 



















###### 12 









In that day the LORD will thresh from the flowing Euphrates to the Wadi of Egypt, and you, Israel, will be gathered up one by one. 



















###### 13 









And in that day a great trumpet will sound. Those who were perishing in Assyria and those who were exiled in Egypt will come and worship the LORD on the holy mountain in Jerusalem.

# Isaiah 28

***




















###### 1 









Woe to that wreath, the pride of Ephraim's drunkards, to the fading flower, his glorious beauty, set on the head of a fertile valley-- to that city, the pride of those laid low by wine! 



















###### 2 









See, the Lord has one who is powerful and strong. Like a hailstorm and a destructive wind, like a driving rain and a flooding downpour, he will throw it forcefully to the ground. 



















###### 3 









That wreath, the pride of Ephraim's drunkards, will be trampled underfoot. 



















###### 4 









That fading flower, his glorious beauty, set on the head of a fertile valley, will be like figs ripe before harvest-- as soon as people see them and take them in hand, they swallow them. 



















###### 5 









In that day the LORD Almighty will be a glorious crown, a beautiful wreath for the remnant of his people. 



















###### 6 









He will be a spirit of justice to the one who sits in judgment, a source of strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate. 



















###### 7 









And these also stagger from wine and reel from beer: Priests and prophets stagger from beer and are befuddled with wine; they reel from beer, they stagger when seeing visions, they stumble when rendering decisions. 



















###### 8 









All the tables are covered with vomit and there is not a spot without filth. 



















###### 9 









"Who is it he is trying to teach? To whom is he explaining his message? To children weaned from their milk, to those just taken from the breast? 



















###### 10 









For it is: Do this, do that, a rule for this, a rule for that[^a]; a little here, a little there." 



















###### 11 









Very well then, with foreign lips and strange tongues God will speak to this people, 



















###### 12 









to whom he said, "This is the resting place, let the weary rest"; and, "This is the place of repose"-- but they would not listen. 



















###### 13 









So then, the word of the LORD to them will become: Do this, do that, a rule for this, a rule for that; a little here, a little there-- so that as they go they will fall backward; they will be injured and snared and captured. 



















###### 14 









Therefore hear the word of the LORD, you scoffers who rule this people in Jerusalem. 



















###### 15 









You boast, "We have entered into a covenant with death, with the realm of the dead we have made an agreement. When an overwhelming scourge sweeps by, it cannot touch us, for we have made a lie our refuge and falsehood[^b] our hiding place." 



















###### 16 









So this is what the Sovereign LORD says: "See, I lay a stone in Zion, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone for a sure foundation; the one who relies on it will never be stricken with panic. 



















###### 17 









I will make justice the measuring line and righteousness the plumb line; hail will sweep away your refuge, the lie, and water will overflow your hiding place. 



















###### 18 









Your covenant with death will be annulled; your agreement with the realm of the dead will not stand. When the overwhelming scourge sweeps by, you will be beaten down by it. 



















###### 19 









As often as it comes it will carry you away; morning after morning, by day and by night, it will sweep through." The understanding of this message will bring sheer terror. 



















###### 20 









The bed is too short to stretch out on, the blanket too narrow to wrap around you. 



















###### 21 









The LORD will rise up as he did at Mount Perazim, he will rouse himself as in the Valley of Gibeon-- to do his work, his strange work, and perform his task, his alien task. 



















###### 22 









Now stop your mocking, or your chains will become heavier; the Lord, the LORD Almighty, has told me of the destruction decreed against the whole land. 



















###### 23 









Listen and hear my voice; pay attention and hear what I say. 



















###### 24 









When a farmer plows for planting, does he plow continually? Does he keep on breaking up and working the soil? 



















###### 25 









When he has leveled the surface, does he not sow caraway and scatter cumin? Does he not plant wheat in its place,[^c] barley in its plot,[^d] and spelt in its field? 



















###### 26 









His God instructs him and teaches him the right way. 



















###### 27 









Caraway is not threshed with a sledge, nor is the wheel of a cart rolled over cumin; caraway is beaten out with a rod, and cumin with a stick. 



















###### 28 









Grain must be ground to make bread; so one does not go on threshing it forever. The wheels of a threshing cart may be rolled over it, but one does not use horses to grind grain. 



















###### 29 









All this also comes from the LORD Almighty, whose plan is wonderful, whose wisdom is magnificent. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

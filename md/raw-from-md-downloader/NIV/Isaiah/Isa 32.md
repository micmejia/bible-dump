# Isaiah 32

***




















###### 1 









See, a king will reign in righteousness and rulers will rule with justice. 



















###### 2 









Each one will be like a shelter from the wind and a refuge from the storm, like streams of water in the desert and the shadow of a great rock in a thirsty land. 



















###### 3 









Then the eyes of those who see will no longer be closed, and the ears of those who hear will listen. 



















###### 4 









The fearful heart will know and understand, and the stammering tongue will be fluent and clear. 



















###### 5 









No longer will the fool be called noble nor the scoundrel be highly respected. 



















###### 6 









For fools speak folly, their hearts are bent on evil: They practice ungodliness and spread error concerning the LORD; the hungry they leave empty and from the thirsty they withhold water. 



















###### 7 









Scoundrels use wicked methods, they make up evil schemes to destroy the poor with lies, even when the plea of the needy is just. 



















###### 8 









But the noble make noble plans, and by noble deeds they stand. ## The Women of Jerusalem 



















###### 9 









You women who are so complacent, rise up and listen to me; you daughters who feel secure, hear what I have to say! 



















###### 10 









In little more than a year you who feel secure will tremble; the grape harvest will fail, and the harvest of fruit will not come. 



















###### 11 









Tremble, you complacent women; shudder, you daughters who feel secure! Strip off your fine clothes and wrap yourselves in rags. 



















###### 12 









Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vines 



















###### 13 









and for the land of my people, a land overgrown with thorns and briers-- yes, mourn for all houses of merriment and for this city of revelry. 



















###### 14 









The fortress will be abandoned, the noisy city deserted; citadel and watchtower will become a wasteland forever, the delight of donkeys, a pasture for flocks, 



















###### 15 









till the Spirit is poured on us from on high, and the desert becomes a fertile field, and the fertile field seems like a forest. 



















###### 16 









The LORD's justice will dwell in the desert, his righteousness live in the fertile field. 



















###### 17 









The fruit of that righteousness will be peace; its effect will be quietness and confidence forever. 



















###### 18 









My people will live in peaceful dwelling places, in secure homes, in undisturbed places of rest. 



















###### 19 









Though hail flattens the forest and the city is leveled completely, 



















###### 20 









how blessed you will be, sowing your seed by every stream, and letting your cattle and donkeys range free. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

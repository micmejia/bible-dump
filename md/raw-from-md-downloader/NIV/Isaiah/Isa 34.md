# Isaiah 34

***




















###### 1 









Come near, you nations, and listen; pay attention, you peoples! Let the earth hear, and all that is in it, the world, and all that comes out of it! 



















###### 2 









The LORD is angry with all nations; his wrath is on all their armies. He will totally destroy[^a] them, he will give them over to slaughter. 



















###### 3 









Their slain will be thrown out, their dead bodies will stink; the mountains will be soaked with their blood. 



















###### 4 









All the stars in the sky will be dissolved and the heavens rolled up like a scroll; all the starry host will fall like withered leaves from the vine, like shriveled figs from the fig tree. 



















###### 5 









My sword has drunk its fill in the heavens; see, it descends in judgment on Edom, the people I have totally destroyed. 



















###### 6 









The sword of the LORD is bathed in blood, it is covered with fat-- the blood of lambs and goats, fat from the kidneys of rams. For the LORD has a sacrifice in Bozrah and a great slaughter in the land of Edom. 



















###### 7 









And the wild oxen will fall with them, the bull calves and the great bulls. Their land will be drenched with blood, and the dust will be soaked with fat. 



















###### 8 









For the LORD has a day of vengeance, a year of retribution, to uphold Zion's cause. 



















###### 9 









Edom's streams will be turned into pitch, her dust into burning sulfur; her land will become blazing pitch! 



















###### 10 









It will not be quenched night or day; its smoke will rise forever. From generation to generation it will lie desolate; no one will ever pass through it again. 



















###### 11 









The desert owl[^b] and screech owl[^c] will possess it; the great owl[^d] and the raven will nest there. God will stretch out over Edom the measuring line of chaos and the plumb line of desolation. 



















###### 12 









Her nobles will have nothing there to be called a kingdom, all her princes will vanish away. 



















###### 13 









Thorns will overrun her citadels, nettles and brambles her strongholds. She will become a haunt for jackals, a home for owls. 



















###### 14 









Desert creatures will meet with hyenas, and wild goats will bleat to each other; there the night creatures will also lie down and find for themselves places of rest. 



















###### 15 









The owl will nest there and lay eggs, she will hatch them, and care for her young under the shadow of her wings; there also the falcons will gather, each with its mate. 



















###### 16 









Look in the scroll of the LORD and read: None of these will be missing, not one will lack her mate. For it is his mouth that has given the order, and his Spirit will gather them together. 



















###### 17 









He allots their portions; his hand distributes them by measure. They will possess it forever and dwell there from generation to generation.

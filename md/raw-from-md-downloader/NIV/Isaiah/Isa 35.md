# Isaiah 35

***




















###### 1 









The desert and the parched land will be glad; the wilderness will rejoice and blossom. Like the crocus, <sup class="versenum mid-line">2</sup>it will burst into bloom; it will rejoice greatly and shout for joy. The glory of Lebanon will be given to it, the splendor of Carmel and Sharon; they will see the glory of the LORD, the splendor of our God. 



















###### 3 









Strengthen the feeble hands, steady the knees that give way; 



















###### 4 









say to those with fearful hearts, "Be strong, do not fear; your God will come, he will come with vengeance; with divine retribution he will come to save you." 



















###### 5 









Then will the eyes of the blind be opened and the ears of the deaf unstopped. 



















###### 6 









Then will the lame leap like a deer, and the mute tongue shout for joy. Water will gush forth in the wilderness and streams in the desert. 



















###### 7 









The burning sand will become a pool, the thirsty ground bubbling springs. In the haunts where jackals once lay, grass and reeds and papyrus will grow. 



















###### 8 









And a highway will be there; it will be called the Way of Holiness; it will be for those who walk on that Way. The unclean will not journey on it; wicked fools will not go about on it. 



















###### 9 









No lion will be there, nor any ravenous beast; they will not be found there. But only the redeemed will walk there, 



















###### 10 









and those the LORD has rescued will return. They will enter Zion with singing; everlasting joy will crown their heads. Gladness and joy will overtake them, and sorrow and sighing will flee away.

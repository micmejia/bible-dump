# Isaiah 4

***




















###### 1 









<sup class="versenum mid-line">1</sup>In that day seven women will take hold of one man and say, "We will eat our own food and provide our own clothes; only let us be called by your name. Take away our disgrace!" ## The Branch of the LORD 



















###### 2 









In that day the Branch of the LORD will be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land will be the pride and glory of the survivors in Israel. 



















###### 3 









Those who are left in Zion, who remain in Jerusalem, will be called holy, all who are recorded among the living in Jerusalem. 



















###### 4 









The Lord will wash away the filth of the women of Zion; he will cleanse the bloodstains from Jerusalem by a spirit[^a] of judgment and a spirit[^b] of fire. 



















###### 5 









Then the LORD will create over all of Mount Zion and over those who assemble there a cloud of smoke by day and a glow of flaming fire by night; over everything the glory[^c] will be a canopy. 



















###### 6 









It will be a shelter and shade from the heat of the day, and a refuge and hiding place from the storm and rain. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

# Isaiah 46

***




















###### 1 









Bel bows down, Nebo stoops low; their idols are borne by beasts of burden.[^a] The images that are carried about are burdensome, a burden for the weary. 



















###### 2 









They stoop and bow down together; unable to rescue the burden, they themselves go off into captivity. 



















###### 3 









"Listen to me, you descendants of Jacob, all the remnant of the people of Israel, you whom I have upheld since your birth, and have carried since you were born. 



















###### 4 









Even to your old age and gray hairs I am he, I am he who will sustain you. I have made you and I will carry you; I will sustain you and I will rescue you. 



















###### 5 









"With whom will you compare me or count me equal? To whom will you liken me that we may be compared? 



















###### 6 









Some pour out gold from their bags and weigh out silver on the scales; they hire a goldsmith to make it into a god, and they bow down and worship it. 



















###### 7 









They lift it to their shoulders and carry it; they set it up in its place, and there it stands. From that spot it cannot move. Even though someone cries out to it, it cannot answer; it cannot save them from their troubles. 



















###### 8 









"Remember this, keep it in mind, take it to heart, you rebels. 



















###### 9 









Remember the former things, those of long ago; I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is none like me. 



















###### 10 









I make known the end from the beginning, from ancient times, what is still to come. I say, 'My purpose will stand, and I will do all that I please.' 



















###### 11 









From the east I summon a bird of prey; from a far-off land, a man to fulfill my purpose. What I have said, that I will bring about; what I have planned, that I will do. 



















###### 12 









Listen to me, you stubborn-hearted, you who are now far from my righteousness. 



















###### 13 









I am bringing my righteousness near, it is not far away; and my salvation will not be delayed. I will grant salvation to Zion, my splendor to Israel.

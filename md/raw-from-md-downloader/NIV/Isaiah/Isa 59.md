# Isaiah 59

***




















###### 1 









Surely the arm of the LORD is not too short to save, nor his ear too dull to hear. 



















###### 2 









But your iniquities have separated you from your God; your sins have hidden his face from you, so that he will not hear. 



















###### 3 









For your hands are stained with blood, your fingers with guilt. Your lips have spoken falsely, and your tongue mutters wicked things. 



















###### 4 









No one calls for justice; no one pleads a case with integrity. They rely on empty arguments, they utter lies; they conceive trouble and give birth to evil. 



















###### 5 









They hatch the eggs of vipers and spin a spider's web. Whoever eats their eggs will die, and when one is broken, an adder is hatched. 



















###### 6 









Their cobwebs are useless for clothing; they cannot cover themselves with what they make. Their deeds are evil deeds, and acts of violence are in their hands. 



















###### 7 









Their feet rush into sin; they are swift to shed innocent blood. They pursue evil schemes; acts of violence mark their ways. 



















###### 8 









The way of peace they do not know; there is no justice in their paths. They have turned them into crooked roads; no one who walks along them will know peace. 



















###### 9 









So justice is far from us, and righteousness does not reach us. We look for light, but all is darkness; for brightness, but we walk in deep shadows. 



















###### 10 









Like the blind we grope along the wall, feeling our way like people without eyes. At midday we stumble as if it were twilight; among the strong, we are like the dead. 



















###### 11 









We all growl like bears; we moan mournfully like doves. We look for justice, but find none; for deliverance, but it is far away. 



















###### 12 









For our offenses are many in your sight, and our sins testify against us. Our offenses are ever with us, and we acknowledge our iniquities: 



















###### 13 









rebellion and treachery against the LORD, turning our backs on our God, inciting revolt and oppression, uttering lies our hearts have conceived. 



















###### 14 









So justice is driven back, and righteousness stands at a distance; truth has stumbled in the streets, honesty cannot enter. 



















###### 15 









Truth is nowhere to be found, and whoever shuns evil becomes a prey. The LORD looked and was displeased that there was no justice. 



















###### 16 









He saw that there was no one, he was appalled that there was no one to intervene; so his own arm achieved salvation for him, and his own righteousness sustained him. 



















###### 17 









He put on righteousness as his breastplate, and the helmet of salvation on his head; he put on the garments of vengeance and wrapped himself in zeal as in a cloak. 



















###### 18 









According to what they have done, so will he repay wrath to his enemies and retribution to his foes; he will repay the islands their due. 



















###### 19 









From the west, people will fear the name of the LORD, and from the rising of the sun, they will revere his glory. For he will come like a pent-up flood that the breath of the LORD drives along.[^a] 



















###### 20 









"The Redeemer will come to Zion, to those in Jacob who repent of their sins," declares the LORD. 



















###### 21 









"As for me, this is my covenant with them," says the LORD. "My Spirit, who is on you, will not depart from you, and my words that I have put in your mouth will always be on your lips, on the lips of your children and on the lips of their descendants--from this time on and forever," says the LORD.

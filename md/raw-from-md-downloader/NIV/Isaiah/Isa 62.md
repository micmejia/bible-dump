# Isaiah 62

***




















###### 1 









For Zion's sake I will not keep silent, for Jerusalem's sake I will not remain quiet, till her vindication shines out like the dawn, her salvation like a blazing torch. 



















###### 2

###### 3 









You will be a crown of splendor in the LORD's hand, a royal diadem in the hand of your God. 



















###### 4 









No longer will they call you Deserted, or name your land Desolate. But you will be called Hephzibah,[^a] and your land Beulah[^b]; for the LORD will take delight in you, and your land will be married. 



















###### 5 









As a young man marries a young woman, so will your Builder marry you; as a bridegroom rejoices over his bride, so will your God rejoice over you. 



















###### 6

###### 7

###### 9 









but those who harvest it will eat it and praise the LORD, and those who gather the grapes will drink it in the courts of my sanctuary." 



















###### 10 









Pass through, pass through the gates! Prepare the way for the people. Build up, build up the highway! Remove the stones. Raise a banner for the nations. 



















###### 11 









The LORD has made proclamation to the ends of the earth: "Say to Daughter Zion, 'See, your Savior comes! See, his reward is with him, and his recompense accompanies him.'" 



















###### 12 









They will be called the Holy People, the Redeemed of the LORD; and you will be called Sought After, the City No Longer Deserted. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

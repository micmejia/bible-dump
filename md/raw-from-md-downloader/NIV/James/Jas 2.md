# James 2

***




















###### 1 









My brothers and sisters, believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ must not show favoritism. 



















###### 2 









Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes, and a poor man in filthy old clothes also comes in. 



















###### 3 









If you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say, "Here's a good seat for you," but say to the poor man, "You stand there" or "Sit on the floor by my feet," 



















###### 4 









have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts? 



















###### 5 









Listen, my dear brothers and sisters: Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom he promised those who love him? 



















###### 6 









But you have dishonored the poor. Is it not the rich who are exploiting you? Are they not the ones who are dragging you into court? 



















###### 7 









Are they not the ones who are blaspheming the noble name of him to whom you belong? 



















###### 8 









If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, "Love your neighbor as yourself,"[^a] you are doing right. 



















###### 9 









But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. 



















###### 10 









For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it. 



















###### 11 









For he who said, "You shall not commit adultery,"[^b] also said, "You shall not murder."[^c] If you do not commit adultery but do commit murder, you have become a lawbreaker. 



















###### 12 









Speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom, 



















###### 13 









because judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful. Mercy triumphs over judgment. ## Faith and Deeds 



















###### 14 









What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save them? 



















###### 15 









Suppose a brother or a sister is without clothes and daily food. 



















###### 16 









If one of you says to them, "Go in peace; keep warm and well fed," but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it? 



















###### 17 









In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead. 



















###### 18 









But someone will say, "You have faith; I have deeds." Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by my deeds. 



















###### 19 









You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that--and shudder. 



















###### 20 









You foolish person, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless[^d]? 



















###### 21 









Was not our father Abraham considered righteous for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar? 



















###### 22 









You see that his faith and his actions were working together, and his faith was made complete by what he did. 



















###### 23 









And the scripture was fulfilled that says, "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness,"[^e] and he was called God's friend. 



















###### 24 









You see that a person is considered righteous by what they do and not by faith alone. 



















###### 25 









In the same way, was not even Rahab the prostitute considered righteous for what she did when she gave lodging to the spies and sent them off in a different direction? 



















###### 26 









As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is dead. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

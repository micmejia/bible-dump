###### 4 









The word of the LORD came to me, saying, 



















###### 5 









"Before I formed you in the womb I knew[^a] you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations." 



















###### 6 









"Alas, Sovereign LORD," I said, "I do not know how to speak; I am too young." 



















###### 7 









But the LORD said to me, "Do not say, 'I am too young.' You must go to everyone I send you to and say whatever I command you. 



















###### 8 









Do not be afraid of them, for I am with you and will rescue you," declares the LORD. 



















###### 9 









Then the LORD reached out his hand and touched my mouth and said to me, "I have put my words in your mouth. 



















###### 10 









See, today I appoint you over nations and kingdoms to uproot and tear down, to destroy and overthrow, to build and to plant." 



















###### 11 









The word of the LORD came to me: "What do you see, Jeremiah?" "I see the branch of an almond tree," I replied. 



















###### 12 









The LORD said to me, "You have seen correctly, for I am watching[^b] to see that my word is fulfilled." 



















###### 13 









The word of the LORD came to me again: "What do you see?" "I see a pot that is boiling," I answered. "It is tilting toward us from the north." 



















###### 14 









The LORD said to me, "From the north disaster will be poured out on all who live in the land. 



















###### 15 









I am about to summon all the peoples of the northern kingdoms," declares the LORD. "Their kings will come and set up their thrones in the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem; they will come against all her surrounding walls and against all the towns of Judah. 



















###### 16 









I will pronounce my judgments on my people because of their wickedness in forsaking me, in burning incense to other gods and in worshiping what their hands have made. 



















###### 17 









"Get yourself ready! Stand up and say to them whatever I command you. Do not be terrified by them, or I will terrify you before them. 



















###### 18 









Today I have made you a fortified city, an iron pillar and a bronze wall to stand against the whole land--against the kings of Judah, its officials, its priests and the people of the land. 



















###### 19 









They will fight against you but will not overcome you, for I am with you and will rescue you," declares the LORD. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

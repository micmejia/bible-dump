###### 16 









"Go and tell Ebed-Melek the Cushite, 'This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I am about to fulfill my words against this city--words concerning disaster, not prosperity. At that time they will be fulfilled before your eyes. 



















###### 17 









But I will rescue you on that day, declares the LORD; you will not be given into the hands of those you fear. 



















###### 18 









I will save you; you will not fall by the sword but will escape with your life, because you trust in me, declares the LORD.'" NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

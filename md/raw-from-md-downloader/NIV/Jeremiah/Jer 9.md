# Jeremiah 9

***




















###### 1 









[^a]<sup class="versenum mid-line">1</sup>Oh, that my head were a spring of water and my eyes a fountain of tears! I would weep day and night for the slain of my people. 



















###### 2 









Oh, that I had in the desert a lodging place for travelers, so that I might leave my people and go away from them; for they are all adulterers, a crowd of unfaithful people. 



















###### 3 









"They make ready their tongue like a bow, to shoot lies; it is not by truth that they triumph[^b] in the land. They go from one sin to another; they do not acknowledge me," declares the LORD. 



















###### 4 









"Beware of your friends; do not trust anyone in your clan. For every one of them is a deceiver,[^c] and every friend a slanderer. 



















###### 5 









Friend deceives friend, and no one speaks the truth. They have taught their tongues to lie; they weary themselves with sinning. 



















###### 6 









You[^d] live in the midst of deception; in their deceit they refuse to acknowledge me," declares the LORD. 



















###### 7 









Therefore this is what the LORD Almighty says: "See, I will refine and test them, for what else can I do because of the sin of my people? 



















###### 8 









Their tongue is a deadly arrow; it speaks deceitfully. With their mouths they all speak cordially to their neighbors, but in their hearts they set traps for them. 



















###### 9 









Should I not punish them for this?" declares the LORD. "Should I not avenge myself on such a nation as this?" 



















###### 10 









I will weep and wail for the mountains and take up a lament concerning the wilderness grasslands. They are desolate and untraveled, and the lowing of cattle is not heard. The birds have all fled and the animals are gone. 



















###### 11 









"I will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins, a haunt of jackals; and I will lay waste the towns of Judah so no one can live there." 



















###### 12 









Who is wise enough to understand this? Who has been instructed by the LORD and can explain it? Why has the land been ruined and laid waste like a desert that no one can cross? 



















###### 13 









The LORD said, "It is because they have forsaken my law, which I set before them; they have not obeyed me or followed my law. 



















###### 14 









Instead, they have followed the stubbornness of their hearts; they have followed the Baals, as their ancestors taught them." 



















###### 15 









Therefore this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: "See, I will make this people eat bitter food and drink poisoned water. 



















###### 16 









I will scatter them among nations that neither they nor their ancestors have known, and I will pursue them with the sword until I have made an end of them." 



















###### 17 









This is what the LORD Almighty says: "Consider now! Call for the wailing women to come; send for the most skillful of them. 



















###### 18 









Let them come quickly and wail over us till our eyes overflow with tears and water streams from our eyelids. 



















###### 19 









The sound of wailing is heard from Zion: 'How ruined we are! How great is our shame! We must leave our land because our houses are in ruins.'" 



















###### 20 









Now, you women, hear the word of the LORD; open your ears to the words of his mouth. Teach your daughters how to wail; teach one another a lament. 



















###### 21 









Death has climbed in through our windows and has entered our fortresses; it has removed the children from the streets and the young men from the public squares. 



















###### 22 









Say, "This is what the LORD declares: "'Dead bodies will lie like dung on the open field, like cut grain behind the reaper, with no one to gather them.'" 



















###### 23 









This is what the LORD says: "Let not the wise boast of their wisdom or the strong boast of their strength or the rich boast of their riches, 



















###### 24 









but let the one who boasts boast about this: that they have the understanding to know me, that I am the LORD, who exercises kindness, justice and righteousness on earth, for in these I delight," declares the LORD. 



















###### 25 









"The days are coming," declares the LORD, "when I will punish all who are circumcised only in the flesh-- 



















###### 26 









Egypt, Judah, Edom, Ammon, Moab and all who live in the wilderness in distant places.[^e] For all these nations are really uncircumcised, and even the whole house of Israel is uncircumcised in heart."

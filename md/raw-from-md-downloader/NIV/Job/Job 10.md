# Job 10

***




















###### 1 









"I loathe my very life; therefore I will give free rein to my complaint and speak out in the bitterness of my soul. 



















###### 2 









I say to God: Do not declare me guilty, but tell me what charges you have against me. 



















###### 3 









Does it please you to oppress me, to spurn the work of your hands, while you smile on the plans of the wicked? 



















###### 4 









Do you have eyes of flesh? Do you see as a mortal sees? 



















###### 5 









Are your days like those of a mortal or your years like those of a strong man, 



















###### 6 









that you must search out my faults and probe after my sin-- 



















###### 7 









though you know that I am not guilty and that no one can rescue me from your hand? 



















###### 8 









"Your hands shaped me and made me. Will you now turn and destroy me? 



















###### 9 









Remember that you molded me like clay. Will you now turn me to dust again? 



















###### 10 









Did you not pour me out like milk and curdle me like cheese, 



















###### 11 









clothe me with skin and flesh and knit me together with bones and sinews? 



















###### 12 









You gave me life and showed me kindness, and in your providence watched over my spirit. 



















###### 13 









"But this is what you concealed in your heart, and I know that this was in your mind: 



















###### 14 









If I sinned, you would be watching me and would not let my offense go unpunished. 



















###### 15 









If I am guilty--woe to me! Even if I am innocent, I cannot lift my head, for I am full of shame and drowned in[^a] my affliction. 



















###### 16 









If I hold my head high, you stalk me like a lion and again display your awesome power against me. 



















###### 17 









You bring new witnesses against me and increase your anger toward me; your forces come against me wave upon wave. 



















###### 18 









"Why then did you bring me out of the womb? I wish I had died before any eye saw me. 



















###### 19 









If only I had never come into being, or had been carried straight from the womb to the grave! 



















###### 20 









Are not my few days almost over? Turn away from me so I can have a moment's joy 



















###### 21 









before I go to the place of no return, to the land of gloom and utter darkness, 



















###### 22 









to the land of deepest night, of utter darkness and disorder, where even the light is like darkness." NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

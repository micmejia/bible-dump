# Job 11

***




















###### 1 









Then Zophar the Naamathite replied: 



















###### 2 









"Are all these words to go unanswered? Is this talker to be vindicated? 



















###### 3 









Will your idle talk reduce others to silence? Will no one rebuke you when you mock? 



















###### 4 









You say to God, 'My beliefs are flawless and I am pure in your sight.' 



















###### 5 









Oh, how I wish that God would speak, that he would open his lips against you 



















###### 6 









and disclose to you the secrets of wisdom, for true wisdom has two sides. Know this: God has even forgotten some of your sin. 



















###### 7 









"Can you fathom the mysteries of God? Can you probe the limits of the Almighty? 



















###### 8 









They are higher than the heavens above--what can you do? They are deeper than the depths below--what can you know? 



















###### 9 









Their measure is longer than the earth and wider than the sea. 



















###### 10 









"If he comes along and confines you in prison and convenes a court, who can oppose him? 



















###### 11 









Surely he recognizes deceivers; and when he sees evil, does he not take note? 



















###### 12 









But the witless can no more become wise than a wild donkey's colt can be born human.[^a] 



















###### 13 









"Yet if you devote your heart to him and stretch out your hands to him, 



















###### 14 









if you put away the sin that is in your hand and allow no evil to dwell in your tent, 



















###### 15 









then, free of fault, you will lift up your face; you will stand firm and without fear. 



















###### 16 









You will surely forget your trouble, recalling it only as waters gone by. 



















###### 17 









Life will be brighter than noonday, and darkness will become like morning. 



















###### 18 









You will be secure, because there is hope; you will look about you and take your rest in safety. 



















###### 19 









You will lie down, with no one to make you afraid, and many will court your favor. 



















###### 20 









But the eyes of the wicked will fail, and escape will elude them; their hope will become a dying gasp." NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

# Job 13

***




















###### 1 









"My eyes have seen all this, my ears have heard and understood it. 



















###### 2 









What you know, I also know; I am not inferior to you. 



















###### 3 









But I desire to speak to the Almighty and to argue my case with God. 



















###### 4 









You, however, smear me with lies; you are worthless physicians, all of you! 



















###### 5 









If only you would be altogether silent! For you, that would be wisdom. 



















###### 6 









Hear now my argument; listen to the pleas of my lips. 



















###### 7 









Will you speak wickedly on God's behalf? Will you speak deceitfully for him? 



















###### 8 









Will you show him partiality? Will you argue the case for God? 



















###### 9 









Would it turn out well if he examined you? Could you deceive him as you might deceive a mortal? 



















###### 10 









He would surely call you to account if you secretly showed partiality. 



















###### 11 









Would not his splendor terrify you? Would not the dread of him fall on you? 



















###### 12 









Your maxims are proverbs of ashes; your defenses are defenses of clay. 



















###### 13 









"Keep silent and let me speak; then let come to me what may. 



















###### 14 









Why do I put myself in jeopardy and take my life in my hands? 



















###### 15 









Though he slay me, yet will I hope in him; I will surely[^a] defend my ways to his face. 



















###### 16 









Indeed, this will turn out for my deliverance, for no godless person would dare come before him! 



















###### 17 









Listen carefully to what I say; let my words ring in your ears. 



















###### 18 









Now that I have prepared my case, I know I will be vindicated. 



















###### 19 









Can anyone bring charges against me? If so, I will be silent and die. 



















###### 20 









"Only grant me these two things, God, and then I will not hide from you: 



















###### 21 









Withdraw your hand far from me, and stop frightening me with your terrors. 



















###### 22 









Then summon me and I will answer, or let me speak, and you reply to me. 



















###### 23 









How many wrongs and sins have I committed? Show me my offense and my sin. 



















###### 24 









Why do you hide your face and consider me your enemy? 



















###### 25 









Will you torment a windblown leaf? Will you chase after dry chaff? 



















###### 26 









For you write down bitter things against me and make me reap the sins of my youth. 



















###### 27 









You fasten my feet in shackles; you keep close watch on all my paths by putting marks on the soles of my feet. 



















###### 28

# Job 14

***




















###### 1 









"Mortals, born of woman, are of few days and full of trouble. 



















###### 2 









They spring up like flowers and wither away; like fleeting shadows, they do not endure. 



















###### 3 









Do you fix your eye on them? Will you bring them[^a] before you for judgment? 



















###### 4 









Who can bring what is pure from the impure? No one! 



















###### 5 









A person's days are determined; you have decreed the number of his months and have set limits he cannot exceed. 



















###### 6 









So look away from him and let him alone, till he has put in his time like a hired laborer. 



















###### 7 









"At least there is hope for a tree: If it is cut down, it will sprout again, and its new shoots will not fail. 



















###### 8 









Its roots may grow old in the ground and its stump die in the soil, 



















###### 9 









yet at the scent of water it will bud and put forth shoots like a plant. 



















###### 10 









But a man dies and is laid low; he breathes his last and is no more. 



















###### 11 









As the water of a lake dries up or a riverbed becomes parched and dry, 



















###### 12 









so he lies down and does not rise; till the heavens are no more, people will not awake or be roused from their sleep. 



















###### 13 









"If only you would hide me in the grave and conceal me till your anger has passed! If only you would set me a time and then remember me! 



















###### 14 









If someone dies, will they live again? All the days of my hard service I will wait for my renewal[^b] to come. 



















###### 15 









You will call and I will answer you; you will long for the creature your hands have made. 



















###### 16 









Surely then you will count my steps but not keep track of my sin. 



















###### 17 









My offenses will be sealed up in a bag; you will cover over my sin. 



















###### 18 









"But as a mountain erodes and crumbles and as a rock is moved from its place, 



















###### 19 









as water wears away stones and torrents wash away the soil, so you destroy a person's hope. 



















###### 20 









You overpower them once for all, and they are gone; you change their countenance and send them away. 



















###### 21 









If their children are honored, they do not know it; if their offspring are brought low, they do not see it. 



















###### 22 









They feel but the pain of their own bodies and mourn only for themselves." NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

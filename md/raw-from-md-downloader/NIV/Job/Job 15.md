# Job 15

***




















###### 1 









Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied: 



















###### 2 









"Would a wise person answer with empty notions or fill their belly with the hot east wind? 



















###### 3 









Would they argue with useless words, with speeches that have no value? 



















###### 4 









But you even undermine piety and hinder devotion to God. 



















###### 5 









Your sin prompts your mouth; you adopt the tongue of the crafty. 



















###### 6 









Your own mouth condemns you, not mine; your own lips testify against you. 



















###### 7 









"Are you the first man ever born? Were you brought forth before the hills? 



















###### 8 









Do you listen in on God's council? Do you have a monopoly on wisdom? 



















###### 9 









What do you know that we do not know? What insights do you have that we do not have? 



















###### 10 









The gray-haired and the aged are on our side, men even older than your father. 



















###### 11 









Are God's consolations not enough for you, words spoken gently to you? 



















###### 12 









Why has your heart carried you away, and why do your eyes flash, 



















###### 13 









so that you vent your rage against God and pour out such words from your mouth? 



















###### 14 









"What are mortals, that they could be pure, or those born of woman, that they could be righteous? 



















###### 15 









If God places no trust in his holy ones, if even the heavens are not pure in his eyes, 



















###### 16 









how much less mortals, who are vile and corrupt, who drink up evil like water! 



















###### 17 









"Listen to me and I will explain to you; let me tell you what I have seen, 



















###### 18 









what the wise have declared, hiding nothing received from their ancestors 



















###### 19 









(to whom alone the land was given when no foreigners moved among them): 



















###### 20 









All his days the wicked man suffers torment, the ruthless man through all the years stored up for him. 



















###### 21 









Terrifying sounds fill his ears; when all seems well, marauders attack him. 



















###### 22 









He despairs of escaping the realm of darkness; he is marked for the sword. 



















###### 23 









He wanders about for food like a vulture; he knows the day of darkness is at hand. 



















###### 24 









Distress and anguish fill him with terror; troubles overwhelm him, like a king poised to attack, 



















###### 25 









because he shakes his fist at God and vaunts himself against the Almighty, 



















###### 26 









defiantly charging against him with a thick, strong shield. 



















###### 27 









"Though his face is covered with fat and his waist bulges with flesh, 



















###### 28 









he will inhabit ruined towns and houses where no one lives, houses crumbling to rubble. 



















###### 29 









He will no longer be rich and his wealth will not endure, nor will his possessions spread over the land. 



















###### 30 









He will not escape the darkness; a flame will wither his shoots, and the breath of God's mouth will carry him away. 



















###### 31 









Let him not deceive himself by trusting what is worthless, for he will get nothing in return. 



















###### 32 









Before his time he will wither, and his branches will not flourish. 



















###### 33 









He will be like a vine stripped of its unripe grapes, like an olive tree shedding its blossoms. 



















###### 34 









For the company of the godless will be barren, and fire will consume the tents of those who love bribes. 



















###### 35 









They conceive trouble and give birth to evil; their womb fashions deceit." NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

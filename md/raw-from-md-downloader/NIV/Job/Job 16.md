# Job 16

***




















###### 1 









Then Job replied: 



















###### 2 









"I have heard many things like these; you are miserable comforters, all of you! 



















###### 3 









Will your long-winded speeches never end? What ails you that you keep on arguing? 



















###### 4 









I also could speak like you, if you were in my place; I could make fine speeches against you and shake my head at you. 



















###### 5 









But my mouth would encourage you; comfort from my lips would bring you relief. 



















###### 6 









"Yet if I speak, my pain is not relieved; and if I refrain, it does not go away. 



















###### 7 









Surely, God, you have worn me out; you have devastated my entire household. 



















###### 8 









You have shriveled me up--and it has become a witness; my gauntness rises up and testifies against me. 



















###### 9 









God assails me and tears me in his anger and gnashes his teeth at me; my opponent fastens on me his piercing eyes. 



















###### 10 









People open their mouths to jeer at me; they strike my cheek in scorn and unite together against me. 



















###### 11 









God has turned me over to the ungodly and thrown me into the clutches of the wicked. 



















###### 12 









All was well with me, but he shattered me; he seized me by the neck and crushed me. He has made me his target; 



















###### 13 









his archers surround me. Without pity, he pierces my kidneys and spills my gall on the ground. 



















###### 14 









Again and again he bursts upon me; he rushes at me like a warrior. 



















###### 15 









"I have sewed sackcloth over my skin and buried my brow in the dust. 



















###### 16 









My face is red with weeping, dark shadows ring my eyes; 



















###### 17 









yet my hands have been free of violence and my prayer is pure. 



















###### 18 









"Earth, do not cover my blood; may my cry never be laid to rest! 



















###### 19 









Even now my witness is in heaven; my advocate is on high. 



















###### 20 









My intercessor is my friend[^a] as my eyes pour out tears to God; 



















###### 21 









on behalf of a man he pleads with God as one pleads for a friend. 



















###### 22

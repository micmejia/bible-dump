# Job 17

***




















###### 1 









<sup class="versenum mid-line">1</sup>My spirit is broken, my days are cut short, the grave awaits me. 



















###### 2 









Surely mockers surround me; my eyes must dwell on their hostility. 



















###### 3 









"Give me, O God, the pledge you demand. Who else will put up security for me? 



















###### 4 









You have closed their minds to understanding; therefore you will not let them triumph. 



















###### 5 









If anyone denounces their friends for reward, the eyes of their children will fail. 



















###### 6 









"God has made me a byword to everyone, a man in whose face people spit. 



















###### 7 









My eyes have grown dim with grief; my whole frame is but a shadow. 



















###### 8 









The upright are appalled at this; the innocent are aroused against the ungodly. 



















###### 9 









Nevertheless, the righteous will hold to their ways, and those with clean hands will grow stronger. 



















###### 10 









"But come on, all of you, try again! I will not find a wise man among you. 



















###### 11 









My days have passed, my plans are shattered. Yet the desires of my heart 



















###### 12 









turn night into day; in the face of the darkness light is near. 



















###### 13 









If the only home I hope for is the grave, if I spread out my bed in the realm of darkness, 



















###### 14 









if I say to corruption, 'You are my father,' and to the worm, 'My mother' or 'My sister,' 



















###### 15 









where then is my hope-- who can see any hope for me? 



















###### 16

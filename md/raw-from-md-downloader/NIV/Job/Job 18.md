# Job 18

***




















###### 1 









Then Bildad the Shuhite replied: 



















###### 2 









"When will you end these speeches? Be sensible, and then we can talk. 



















###### 3 









Why are we regarded as cattle and considered stupid in your sight? 



















###### 4 









You who tear yourself to pieces in your anger, is the earth to be abandoned for your sake? Or must the rocks be moved from their place? 



















###### 5 









"The lamp of a wicked man is snuffed out; the flame of his fire stops burning. 



















###### 6 









The light in his tent becomes dark; the lamp beside him goes out. 



















###### 7 









The vigor of his step is weakened; his own schemes throw him down. 



















###### 8 









His feet thrust him into a net; he wanders into its mesh. 



















###### 9 









A trap seizes him by the heel; a snare holds him fast. 



















###### 10 









A noose is hidden for him on the ground; a trap lies in his path. 



















###### 11 









Terrors startle him on every side and dog his every step. 



















###### 12 









Calamity is hungry for him; disaster is ready for him when he falls. 



















###### 13 









It eats away parts of his skin; death's firstborn devours his limbs. 



















###### 14 









He is torn from the security of his tent and marched off to the king of terrors. 



















###### 15 









Fire resides[^a] in his tent; burning sulfur is scattered over his dwelling. 



















###### 16 









His roots dry up below and his branches wither above. 



















###### 17 









The memory of him perishes from the earth; he has no name in the land. 



















###### 18 









He is driven from light into the realm of darkness and is banished from the world. 



















###### 19 









He has no offspring or descendants among his people, no survivor where once he lived. 



















###### 20 









People of the west are appalled at his fate; those of the east are seized with horror. 



















###### 21

# Job 19

***




















###### 1 









Then Job replied: 



















###### 2 









"How long will you torment me and crush me with words? 



















###### 3 









Ten times now you have reproached me; shamelessly you attack me. 



















###### 4 









If it is true that I have gone astray, my error remains my concern alone. 



















###### 5 









If indeed you would exalt yourselves above me and use my humiliation against me, 



















###### 6 









then know that God has wronged me and drawn his net around me. 



















###### 7 









"Though I cry, 'Violence!' I get no response; though I call for help, there is no justice. 



















###### 8 









He has blocked my way so I cannot pass; he has shrouded my paths in darkness. 



















###### 9 









He has stripped me of my honor and removed the crown from my head. 



















###### 10 









He tears me down on every side till I am gone; he uproots my hope like a tree. 



















###### 11 









His anger burns against me; he counts me among his enemies. 



















###### 12 









His troops advance in force; they build a siege ramp against me and encamp around my tent. 



















###### 13 









"He has alienated my family from me; my acquaintances are completely estranged from me. 



















###### 14 









My relatives have gone away; my closest friends have forgotten me. 



















###### 15 









My guests and my female servants count me a foreigner; they look on me as on a stranger. 



















###### 16 









I summon my servant, but he does not answer, though I beg him with my own mouth. 



















###### 17 









My breath is offensive to my wife; I am loathsome to my own family. 



















###### 18 









Even the little boys scorn me; when I appear, they ridicule me. 



















###### 19 









All my intimate friends detest me; those I love have turned against me. 



















###### 20 









I am nothing but skin and bones; I have escaped only by the skin of my teeth.[^a] 



















###### 21 









"Have pity on me, my friends, have pity, for the hand of God has struck me. 



















###### 22 









Why do you pursue me as God does? Will you never get enough of my flesh? 



















###### 23 









"Oh, that my words were recorded, that they were written on a scroll, 



















###### 24 









that they were inscribed with an iron tool on[^b] lead, or engraved in rock forever! 



















###### 25 









I know that my redeemer[^c] lives, and that in the end he will stand on the earth.[^d] 



















###### 26 









And after my skin has been destroyed, yet[^e] in[^f] my flesh I will see God; 



















###### 27 









I myself will see him with my own eyes--I, and not another. How my heart yearns within me! 



















###### 28 









"If you say, 'How we will hound him, since the root of the trouble lies in him,[^g]' 



















###### 29 









you should fear the sword yourselves; for wrath will bring punishment by the sword, and then you will know that there is judgment.[^h]" NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

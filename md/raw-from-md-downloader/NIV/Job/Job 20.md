# Job 20

***




















###### 1 









Then Zophar the Naamathite replied: 



















###### 2 









"My troubled thoughts prompt me to answer because I am greatly disturbed. 



















###### 3 









I hear a rebuke that dishonors me, and my understanding inspires me to reply. 



















###### 4 









"Surely you know how it has been from of old, ever since mankind[^a] was placed on the earth, 



















###### 5 









that the mirth of the wicked is brief, the joy of the godless lasts but a moment. 



















###### 6 









Though the pride of the godless person reaches to the heavens and his head touches the clouds, 



















###### 7 









he will perish forever, like his own dung; those who have seen him will say, 'Where is he?' 



















###### 8 









Like a dream he flies away, no more to be found, banished like a vision of the night. 



















###### 9 









The eye that saw him will not see him again; his place will look on him no more. 



















###### 10 









His children must make amends to the poor; his own hands must give back his wealth. 



















###### 11 









The youthful vigor that fills his bones will lie with him in the dust. 



















###### 12 









"Though evil is sweet in his mouth and he hides it under his tongue, 



















###### 13 









though he cannot bear to let it go and lets it linger in his mouth, 



















###### 14 









yet his food will turn sour in his stomach; it will become the venom of serpents within him. 



















###### 15 









He will spit out the riches he swallowed; God will make his stomach vomit them up. 



















###### 16 









He will suck the poison of serpents; the fangs of an adder will kill him. 



















###### 17 









He will not enjoy the streams, the rivers flowing with honey and cream. 



















###### 18 









What he toiled for he must give back uneaten; he will not enjoy the profit from his trading. 



















###### 19 









For he has oppressed the poor and left them destitute; he has seized houses he did not build. 



















###### 20 









"Surely he will have no respite from his craving; he cannot save himself by his treasure. 



















###### 21 









Nothing is left for him to devour; his prosperity will not endure. 



















###### 22 









In the midst of his plenty, distress will overtake him; the full force of misery will come upon him. 



















###### 23 









When he has filled his belly, God will vent his burning anger against him and rain down his blows on him. 



















###### 24 









Though he flees from an iron weapon, a bronze-tipped arrow pierces him. 



















###### 25 









He pulls it out of his back, the gleaming point out of his liver. Terrors will come over him; 



















###### 26 









total darkness lies in wait for his treasures. A fire unfanned will consume him and devour what is left in his tent. 



















###### 27 









The heavens will expose his guilt; the earth will rise up against him. 



















###### 28 









A flood will carry off his house, rushing waters[^b] on the day of God's wrath. 



















###### 29 









Such is the fate God allots the wicked, the heritage appointed for them by God." NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

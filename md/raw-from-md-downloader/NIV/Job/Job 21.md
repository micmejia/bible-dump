# Job 21

***




















###### 1 









Then Job replied: 



















###### 2 









"Listen carefully to my words; let this be the consolation you give me. 



















###### 3 









Bear with me while I speak, and after I have spoken, mock on. 



















###### 4 









"Is my complaint directed to a human being? Why should I not be impatient? 



















###### 5 









Look at me and be appalled; clap your hand over your mouth. 



















###### 6 









When I think about this, I am terrified; trembling seizes my body. 



















###### 7 









Why do the wicked live on, growing old and increasing in power? 



















###### 8 









They see their children established around them, their offspring before their eyes. 



















###### 9 









Their homes are safe and free from fear; the rod of God is not on them. 



















###### 10 









Their bulls never fail to breed; their cows calve and do not miscarry. 



















###### 11 









They send forth their children as a flock; their little ones dance about. 



















###### 12 









They sing to the music of timbrel and lyre; they make merry to the sound of the pipe. 



















###### 13 









They spend their years in prosperity and go down to the grave in peace.[^a] 



















###### 14 









Yet they say to God, 'Leave us alone! We have no desire to know your ways. 



















###### 15 









Who is the Almighty, that we should serve him? What would we gain by praying to him?' 



















###### 16 









But their prosperity is not in their own hands, so I stand aloof from the plans of the wicked. 



















###### 17 









"Yet how often is the lamp of the wicked snuffed out? How often does calamity come upon them, the fate God allots in his anger? 



















###### 18 









How often are they like straw before the wind, like chaff swept away by a gale? 



















###### 19 









It is said, 'God stores up the punishment of the wicked for their children.' Let him repay the wicked, so that they themselves will experience it! 



















###### 20 









Let their own eyes see their destruction; let them drink the cup of the wrath of the Almighty. 



















###### 21 









For what do they care about the families they leave behind when their allotted months come to an end? 



















###### 22 









"Can anyone teach knowledge to God, since he judges even the highest? 



















###### 23 









One person dies in full vigor, completely secure and at ease, 



















###### 24 









well nourished in body,[^b] bones rich with marrow. 



















###### 25 









Another dies in bitterness of soul, never having enjoyed anything good. 



















###### 26 









Side by side they lie in the dust, and worms cover them both. 



















###### 27 









"I know full well what you are thinking, the schemes by which you would wrong me. 



















###### 28 









You say, 'Where now is the house of the great, the tents where the wicked lived?' 



















###### 29 









Have you never questioned those who travel? Have you paid no regard to their accounts-- 



















###### 30 









that the wicked are spared from the day of calamity, that they are delivered from[^c] the day of wrath? 



















###### 31 









Who denounces their conduct to their face? Who repays them for what they have done? 



















###### 32 









They are carried to the grave, and watch is kept over their tombs. 



















###### 33 









The soil in the valley is sweet to them; everyone follows after them, and a countless throng goes[^d] before them. 



















###### 34

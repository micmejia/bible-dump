# Job 23

***




















###### 1 









Then Job replied: 



















###### 2 









"Even today my complaint is bitter; his hand[^a] is heavy in spite of[^b] my groaning. 



















###### 3 









If only I knew where to find him; if only I could go to his dwelling! 



















###### 4 









I would state my case before him and fill my mouth with arguments. 



















###### 5 









I would find out what he would answer me, and consider what he would say to me. 



















###### 6 









Would he vigorously oppose me? No, he would not press charges against me. 



















###### 7 









There the upright can establish their innocence before him, and there I would be delivered forever from my judge. 



















###### 8 









"But if I go to the east, he is not there; if I go to the west, I do not find him. 



















###### 9 









When he is at work in the north, I do not see him; when he turns to the south, I catch no glimpse of him. 



















###### 10 









But he knows the way that I take; when he has tested me, I will come forth as gold. 



















###### 11 









My feet have closely followed his steps; I have kept to his way without turning aside. 



















###### 12 









I have not departed from the commands of his lips; I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my daily bread. 



















###### 13 









"But he stands alone, and who can oppose him? He does whatever he pleases. 



















###### 14 









He carries out his decree against me, and many such plans he still has in store. 



















###### 15 









That is why I am terrified before him; when I think of all this, I fear him. 



















###### 16 









God has made my heart faint; the Almighty has terrified me. 



















###### 17 









Yet I am not silenced by the darkness, by the thick darkness that covers my face. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

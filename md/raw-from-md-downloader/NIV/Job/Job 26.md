# Job 26

***




















###### 1 









Then Job replied: 



















###### 2 









"How you have helped the powerless! How you have saved the arm that is feeble! 



















###### 3 









What advice you have offered to one without wisdom! And what great insight you have displayed! 



















###### 4 









Who has helped you utter these words? And whose spirit spoke from your mouth? 



















###### 5 









"The dead are in deep anguish, those beneath the waters and all that live in them. 



















###### 6 









The realm of the dead is naked before God; Destruction[^a] lies uncovered. 



















###### 7 









He spreads out the northern skies over empty space; he suspends the earth over nothing. 



















###### 8 









He wraps up the waters in his clouds, yet the clouds do not burst under their weight. 



















###### 9 









He covers the face of the full moon, spreading his clouds over it. 



















###### 10 









He marks out the horizon on the face of the waters for a boundary between light and darkness. 



















###### 11 









The pillars of the heavens quake, aghast at his rebuke. 



















###### 12 









By his power he churned up the sea; by his wisdom he cut Rahab to pieces. 



















###### 13 









By his breath the skies became fair; his hand pierced the gliding serpent. 



















###### 14 









And these are but the outer fringe of his works; how faint the whisper we hear of him! Who then can understand the thunder of his power?"

# Job 27

***




















###### 1 









And Job continued his discourse: 



















###### 2 









"As surely as God lives, who has denied me justice, the Almighty, who has made my life bitter, 



















###### 3 









as long as I have life within me, the breath of God in my nostrils, 



















###### 4 









my lips will not say anything wicked, and my tongue will not utter lies. 



















###### 5 









I will never admit you are in the right; till I die, I will not deny my integrity. 



















###### 6 









I will maintain my innocence and never let go of it; my conscience will not reproach me as long as I live. 



















###### 7 









"May my enemy be like the wicked, my adversary like the unjust! 



















###### 8 









For what hope have the godless when they are cut off, when God takes away their life? 



















###### 9 









Does God listen to their cry when distress comes upon them? 



















###### 10 









Will they find delight in the Almighty? Will they call on God at all times? 



















###### 11 









"I will teach you about the power of God; the ways of the Almighty I will not conceal. 



















###### 12 









You have all seen this yourselves. Why then this meaningless talk? 



















###### 13 









"Here is the fate God allots to the wicked, the heritage a ruthless man receives from the Almighty: 



















###### 14 









However many his children, their fate is the sword; his offspring will never have enough to eat. 



















###### 15 









The plague will bury those who survive him, and their widows will not weep for them. 



















###### 16 









Though he heaps up silver like dust and clothes like piles of clay, 



















###### 17 









what he lays up the righteous will wear, and the innocent will divide his silver. 



















###### 18 









The house he builds is like a moth's cocoon, like a hut made by a watchman. 



















###### 19 









He lies down wealthy, but will do so no more; when he opens his eyes, all is gone. 



















###### 20 









Terrors overtake him like a flood; a tempest snatches him away in the night. 



















###### 21 









The east wind carries him off, and he is gone; it sweeps him out of his place. 



















###### 22 









It hurls itself against him without mercy as he flees headlong from its power. 



















###### 23 









It claps its hands in derision and hisses him out of his place." NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

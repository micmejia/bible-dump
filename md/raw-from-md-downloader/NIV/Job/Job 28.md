# Job 28

***




















###### 1 









There is a mine for silver and a place where gold is refined. 



















###### 2 









Iron is taken from the earth, and copper is smelted from ore. 



















###### 3 









Mortals put an end to the darkness; they search out the farthest recesses for ore in the blackest darkness. 



















###### 4 









Far from human dwellings they cut a shaft, in places untouched by human feet; far from other people they dangle and sway. 



















###### 5 









The earth, from which food comes, is transformed below as by fire; 



















###### 6 









lapis lazuli comes from its rocks, and its dust contains nuggets of gold. 



















###### 7 









No bird of prey knows that hidden path, no falcon's eye has seen it. 



















###### 8 









Proud beasts do not set foot on it, and no lion prowls there. 



















###### 9 









People assault the flinty rock with their hands and lay bare the roots of the mountains. 



















###### 10 









They tunnel through the rock; their eyes see all its treasures. 



















###### 11 









They search[^a] the sources of the rivers and bring hidden things to light. 



















###### 12 









But where can wisdom be found? Where does understanding dwell? 



















###### 13 









No mortal comprehends its worth; it cannot be found in the land of the living. 



















###### 14 









The deep says, "It is not in me"; the sea says, "It is not with me." 



















###### 15 









It cannot be bought with the finest gold, nor can its price be weighed out in silver. 



















###### 16 









It cannot be bought with the gold of Ophir, with precious onyx or lapis lazuli. 



















###### 17 









Neither gold nor crystal can compare with it, nor can it be had for jewels of gold. 



















###### 18 









Coral and jasper are not worthy of mention; the price of wisdom is beyond rubies. 



















###### 19 









The topaz of Cush cannot compare with it; it cannot be bought with pure gold. 



















###### 20 









Where then does wisdom come from? Where does understanding dwell? 



















###### 21 









It is hidden from the eyes of every living thing, concealed even from the birds in the sky. 



















###### 22 









Destruction[^b] and Death say, "Only a rumor of it has reached our ears." 



















###### 23 









God understands the way to it and he alone knows where it dwells, 



















###### 24 









for he views the ends of the earth and sees everything under the heavens. 



















###### 25 









When he established the force of the wind and measured out the waters, 



















###### 26 









when he made a decree for the rain and a path for the thunderstorm, 



















###### 27 









then he looked at wisdom and appraised it; he confirmed it and tested it. 



















###### 28 









And he said to the human race, "The fear of the Lord--that is wisdom, and to shun evil is understanding." NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

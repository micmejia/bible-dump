# Job 3

***




















###### 1 









After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth. 



















###### 2 









He said: 



















###### 3 









"May the day of my birth perish, and the night that said, 'A boy is conceived!' 



















###### 4 









That day--may it turn to darkness; may God above not care about it; may no light shine on it. 



















###### 5 









May gloom and utter darkness claim it once more; may a cloud settle over it; may blackness overwhelm it. 



















###### 6 









That night--may thick darkness seize it; may it not be included among the days of the year nor be entered in any of the months. 



















###### 7 









May that night be barren; may no shout of joy be heard in it. 



















###### 8 









May those who curse days[^a] curse that day, those who are ready to rouse Leviathan. 



















###### 9 









May its morning stars become dark; may it wait for daylight in vain and not see the first rays of dawn, 



















###### 10 









for it did not shut the doors of the womb on me to hide trouble from my eyes. 



















###### 11 









"Why did I not perish at birth, and die as I came from the womb? 



















###### 12 









Why were there knees to receive me and breasts that I might be nursed? 



















###### 13 









For now I would be lying down in peace; I would be asleep and at rest 



















###### 14 









with kings and rulers of the earth, who built for themselves places now lying in ruins, 



















###### 15 









with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver. 



















###### 16 









Or why was I not hidden away in the ground like a stillborn child, like an infant who never saw the light of day? 



















###### 17 









There the wicked cease from turmoil, and there the weary are at rest. 



















###### 18 









Captives also enjoy their ease; they no longer hear the slave driver's shout. 



















###### 19 









The small and the great are there, and the slaves are freed from their owners. 



















###### 20 









"Why is light given to those in misery, and life to the bitter of soul, 



















###### 21 









to those who long for death that does not come, who search for it more than for hidden treasure, 



















###### 22 









who are filled with gladness and rejoice when they reach the grave? 



















###### 23 









Why is life given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in? 



















###### 24 









For sighing has become my daily food; my groans pour out like water. 



















###### 25 









What I feared has come upon me; what I dreaded has happened to me. 



















###### 26 









I have no peace, no quietness; I have no rest, but only turmoil." NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

# Job 30

***




















###### 1 









"But now they mock me, men younger than I, whose fathers I would have disdained to put with my sheep dogs. 



















###### 2 









Of what use was the strength of their hands to me, since their vigor had gone from them? 



















###### 3 









Haggard from want and hunger, they roamed[^a] the parched land in desolate wastelands at night. 



















###### 4 









In the brush they gathered salt herbs, and their food[^b] was the root of the broom bush. 



















###### 5 









They were banished from human society, shouted at as if they were thieves. 



















###### 6 









They were forced to live in the dry stream beds, among the rocks and in holes in the ground. 



















###### 7 









They brayed among the bushes and huddled in the undergrowth. 



















###### 8 









A base and nameless brood, they were driven out of the land. 



















###### 9 









"And now those young men mock me in song; I have become a byword among them. 



















###### 10 









They detest me and keep their distance; they do not hesitate to spit in my face. 



















###### 11 









Now that God has unstrung my bow and afflicted me, they throw off restraint in my presence. 



















###### 12 









On my right the tribe[^c] attacks; they lay snares for my feet, they build their siege ramps against me. 



















###### 13 









They break up my road; they succeed in destroying me. 'No one can help him,' they say. 



















###### 14 









They advance as through a gaping breach; amid the ruins they come rolling in. 



















###### 15 









Terrors overwhelm me; my dignity is driven away as by the wind, my safety vanishes like a cloud. 



















###### 16 









"And now my life ebbs away; days of suffering grip me. 



















###### 17 









Night pierces my bones; my gnawing pains never rest. 



















###### 18 









In his great power God becomes like clothing to me[^d]; he binds me like the neck of my garment. 



















###### 19 









He throws me into the mud, and I am reduced to dust and ashes. 



















###### 20 









"I cry out to you, God, but you do not answer; I stand up, but you merely look at me. 



















###### 21 









You turn on me ruthlessly; with the might of your hand you attack me. 



















###### 22 









You snatch me up and drive me before the wind; you toss me about in the storm. 



















###### 23 









I know you will bring me down to death, to the place appointed for all the living. 



















###### 24 









"Surely no one lays a hand on a broken man when he cries for help in his distress. 



















###### 25 









Have I not wept for those in trouble? Has not my soul grieved for the poor? 



















###### 26 









Yet when I hoped for good, evil came; when I looked for light, then came darkness. 



















###### 27 









The churning inside me never stops; days of suffering confront me. 



















###### 28 









I go about blackened, but not by the sun; I stand up in the assembly and cry for help. 



















###### 29 









I have become a brother of jackals, a companion of owls. 



















###### 30 









My skin grows black and peels; my body burns with fever. 



















###### 31 









My lyre is tuned to mourning, and my pipe to the sound of wailing. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

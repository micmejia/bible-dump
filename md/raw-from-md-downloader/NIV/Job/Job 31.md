# Job 31

***




















###### 1 









"I made a covenant with my eyes not to look lustfully at a young woman. 



















###### 2 









For what is our lot from God above, our heritage from the Almighty on high? 



















###### 3 









Is it not ruin for the wicked, disaster for those who do wrong? 



















###### 4 









Does he not see my ways and count my every step? 



















###### 5 









"If I have walked with falsehood or my foot has hurried after deceit-- 



















###### 6 









let God weigh me in honest scales and he will know that I am blameless-- 



















###### 7 









if my steps have turned from the path, if my heart has been led by my eyes, or if my hands have been defiled, 



















###### 8 









then may others eat what I have sown, and may my crops be uprooted. 



















###### 9 









"If my heart has been enticed by a woman, or if I have lurked at my neighbor's door, 



















###### 10 









then may my wife grind another man's grain, and may other men sleep with her. 



















###### 11 









For that would have been wicked, a sin to be judged. 



















###### 12 









It is a fire that burns to Destruction[^a]; it would have uprooted my harvest. 



















###### 13 









"If I have denied justice to any of my servants, whether male or female, when they had a grievance against me, 



















###### 14 









what will I do when God confronts me? What will I answer when called to account? 



















###### 15 









Did not he who made me in the womb make them? Did not the same one form us both within our mothers? 



















###### 16 









"If I have denied the desires of the poor or let the eyes of the widow grow weary, 



















###### 17 









if I have kept my bread to myself, not sharing it with the fatherless-- 



















###### 18 









but from my youth I reared them as a father would, and from my birth I guided the widow-- 



















###### 19 









if I have seen anyone perishing for lack of clothing, or the needy without garments, 



















###### 20 









and their hearts did not bless me for warming them with the fleece from my sheep, 



















###### 21 









if I have raised my hand against the fatherless, knowing that I had influence in court, 



















###### 22 









then let my arm fall from the shoulder, let it be broken off at the joint. 



















###### 23 









For I dreaded destruction from God, and for fear of his splendor I could not do such things. 



















###### 24 









"If I have put my trust in gold or said to pure gold, 'You are my security,' 



















###### 25 









if I have rejoiced over my great wealth, the fortune my hands had gained, 



















###### 26 









if I have regarded the sun in its radiance or the moon moving in splendor, 



















###### 27 









so that my heart was secretly enticed and my hand offered them a kiss of homage, 



















###### 28 









then these also would be sins to be judged, for I would have been unfaithful to God on high. 



















###### 29 









"If I have rejoiced at my enemy's misfortune or gloated over the trouble that came to him-- 



















###### 30 









I have not allowed my mouth to sin by invoking a curse against their life-- 



















###### 31 









if those of my household have never said, 'Who has not been filled with Job's meat?'-- 



















###### 32 









but no stranger had to spend the night in the street, for my door was always open to the traveler-- 



















###### 33 









if I have concealed my sin as people do,[^b] by hiding my guilt in my heart 



















###### 34 









because I so feared the crowd and so dreaded the contempt of the clans that I kept silent and would not go outside-- 



















###### 35 









("Oh, that I had someone to hear me! I sign now my defense--let the Almighty answer me; let my accuser put his indictment in writing. 



















###### 36 









Surely I would wear it on my shoulder, I would put it on like a crown. 



















###### 37 









I would give him an account of my every step; I would present it to him as to a ruler.)-- 



















###### 38 









"if my land cries out against me and all its furrows are wet with tears, 



















###### 39 









if I have devoured its yield without payment or broken the spirit of its tenants, 



















###### 40 









then let briers come up instead of wheat and stinkweed instead of barley." The words of Job are ended. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

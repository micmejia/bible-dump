# Job 32

***




















###### 1 









So these three men stopped answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes. 



















###### 2 









But Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became very angry with Job for justifying himself rather than God. 



















###### 3 









He was also angry with the three friends, because they had found no way to refute Job, and yet had condemned him.[^a] 



















###### 4 









Now Elihu had waited before speaking to Job because they were older than he. 



















###### 5 









But when he saw that the three men had nothing more to say, his anger was aroused. 



















###### 6 









So Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite said: "I am young in years, and you are old; that is why I was fearful, not daring to tell you what I know. 



















###### 7 









I thought, 'Age should speak; advanced years should teach wisdom.' 



















###### 8 









But it is the spirit[^b] in a person, the breath of the Almighty, that gives them understanding. 



















###### 9 









It is not only the old[^c] who are wise, not only the aged who understand what is right. 



















###### 10 









"Therefore I say: Listen to me; I too will tell you what I know. 



















###### 11 









I waited while you spoke, I listened to your reasoning; while you were searching for words, 



















###### 12 









I gave you my full attention. But not one of you has proved Job wrong; none of you has answered his arguments. 



















###### 13 









Do not say, 'We have found wisdom; let God, not a man, refute him.' 



















###### 14 









But Job has not marshaled his words against me, and I will not answer him with your arguments. 



















###### 15 









"They are dismayed and have no more to say; words have failed them. 



















###### 16 









Must I wait, now that they are silent, now that they stand there with no reply? 



















###### 17 









I too will have my say; I too will tell what I know. 



















###### 18 









For I am full of words, and the spirit within me compels me; 



















###### 19 









inside I am like bottled-up wine, like new wineskins ready to burst. 



















###### 20 









I must speak and find relief; I must open my lips and reply. 



















###### 21 









I will show no partiality, nor will I flatter anyone; 



















###### 22 









for if I were skilled in flattery, my Maker would soon take me away. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

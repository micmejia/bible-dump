# Job 33

***




















###### 1 









"But now, Job, listen to my words; pay attention to everything I say. 



















###### 2 









I am about to open my mouth; my words are on the tip of my tongue. 



















###### 3 









My words come from an upright heart; my lips sincerely speak what I know. 



















###### 4 









The Spirit of God has made me; the breath of the Almighty gives me life. 



















###### 5 









Answer me then, if you can; stand up and argue your case before me. 



















###### 6 









I am the same as you in God's sight; I too am a piece of clay. 



















###### 7 









No fear of me should alarm you, nor should my hand be heavy on you. 



















###### 8 









"But you have said in my hearing-- I heard the very words-- 



















###### 9 









'I am pure, I have done no wrong; I am clean and free from sin. 



















###### 10 









Yet God has found fault with me; he considers me his enemy. 



















###### 11 









He fastens my feet in shackles; he keeps close watch on all my paths.' 



















###### 12 









"But I tell you, in this you are not right, for God is greater than any mortal. 



















###### 13 









Why do you complain to him that he responds to no one's words[^a]? 



















###### 14 









For God does speak--now one way, now another-- though no one perceives it. 



















###### 15 









In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on people as they slumber in their beds, 



















###### 16 









he may speak in their ears and terrify them with warnings, 



















###### 17 









to turn them from wrongdoing and keep them from pride, 



















###### 18 









to preserve them from the pit, their lives from perishing by the sword.[^b] 



















###### 19 









"Or someone may be chastened on a bed of pain with constant distress in their bones, 



















###### 20 









so that their body finds food repulsive and their soul loathes the choicest meal. 



















###### 21 









Their flesh wastes away to nothing, and their bones, once hidden, now stick out. 



















###### 22 









They draw near to the pit, and their life to the messengers of death.[^c] 



















###### 23 









Yet if there is an angel at their side, a messenger, one out of a thousand, sent to tell them how to be upright, 



















###### 24 









and he is gracious to that person and says to God, 'Spare them from going down to the pit; I have found a ransom for them-- 



















###### 25 









let their flesh be renewed like a child's; let them be restored as in the days of their youth'-- 



















###### 26 









then that person can pray to God and find favor with him, they will see God's face and shout for joy; he will restore them to full well-being. 



















###### 27 









And they will go to others and say, 'I have sinned, I have perverted what is right, but I did not get what I deserved. 



















###### 28 









God has delivered me from going down to the pit, and I shall live to enjoy the light of life.' 



















###### 29 









"God does all these things to a person-- twice, even three times-- 



















###### 30 









to turn them back from the pit, that the light of life may shine on them. 



















###### 31 









"Pay attention, Job, and listen to me; be silent, and I will speak. 



















###### 32 









If you have anything to say, answer me; speak up, for I want to vindicate you. 



















###### 33 









But if not, then listen to me; be silent, and I will teach you wisdom." NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

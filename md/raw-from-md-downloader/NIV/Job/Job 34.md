# Job 34

***




















###### 1 









Then Elihu said: 



















###### 2 









"Hear my words, you wise men; listen to me, you men of learning. 



















###### 3 









For the ear tests words as the tongue tastes food. 



















###### 4 









Let us discern for ourselves what is right; let us learn together what is good. 



















###### 5 









"Job says, 'I am innocent, but God denies me justice. 



















###### 6 









Although I am right, I am considered a liar; although I am guiltless, his arrow inflicts an incurable wound.' 



















###### 7 









Is there anyone like Job, who drinks scorn like water? 



















###### 8 









He keeps company with evildoers; he associates with the wicked. 



















###### 9 









For he says, 'There is no profit in trying to please God.' 



















###### 10 









"So listen to me, you men of understanding. Far be it from God to do evil, from the Almighty to do wrong. 



















###### 11 









He repays everyone for what they have done; he brings on them what their conduct deserves. 



















###### 12 









It is unthinkable that God would do wrong, that the Almighty would pervert justice. 



















###### 13 









Who appointed him over the earth? Who put him in charge of the whole world? 



















###### 14 









If it were his intention and he withdrew his spirit[^a] and breath, 



















###### 15 









all humanity would perish together and mankind would return to the dust. 



















###### 16 









"If you have understanding, hear this; listen to what I say. 



















###### 17 









Can someone who hates justice govern? Will you condemn the just and mighty One? 



















###### 18 









Is he not the One who says to kings, 'You are worthless,' and to nobles, 'You are wicked,' 



















###### 19 









who shows no partiality to princes and does not favor the rich over the poor, for they are all the work of his hands? 



















###### 20 









They die in an instant, in the middle of the night; the people are shaken and they pass away; the mighty are removed without human hand. 



















###### 21 









"His eyes are on the ways of mortals; he sees their every step. 



















###### 22 









There is no deep shadow, no utter darkness, where evildoers can hide. 



















###### 23 









God has no need to examine people further, that they should come before him for judgment. 



















###### 24 









Without inquiry he shatters the mighty and sets up others in their place. 



















###### 25 









Because he takes note of their deeds, he overthrows them in the night and they are crushed. 



















###### 26 









He punishes them for their wickedness where everyone can see them, 



















###### 27 









because they turned from following him and had no regard for any of his ways. 



















###### 28 









They caused the cry of the poor to come before him, so that he heard the cry of the needy. 



















###### 29 









But if he remains silent, who can condemn him? If he hides his face, who can see him? Yet he is over individual and nation alike, 



















###### 30 









to keep the godless from ruling, from laying snares for the people. 



















###### 31 









"Suppose someone says to God, 'I am guilty but will offend no more. 



















###### 32 









Teach me what I cannot see; if I have done wrong, I will not do so again.' 



















###### 33 









Should God then reward you on your terms, when you refuse to repent? You must decide, not I; so tell me what you know. 



















###### 34 









"Men of understanding declare, wise men who hear me say to me, 



















###### 35 









'Job speaks without knowledge; his words lack insight.' 



















###### 36 









Oh, that Job might be tested to the utmost for answering like a wicked man! 



















###### 37 









To his sin he adds rebellion; scornfully he claps his hands among us and multiplies his words against God." NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

# Job 36

***




















###### 1 









Elihu continued: 



















###### 2 









"Bear with me a little longer and I will show you that there is more to be said in God's behalf. 



















###### 3 









I get my knowledge from afar; I will ascribe justice to my Maker. 



















###### 4 









Be assured that my words are not false; one who has perfect knowledge is with you. 



















###### 5 









"God is mighty, but despises no one; he is mighty, and firm in his purpose. 



















###### 6 









He does not keep the wicked alive but gives the afflicted their rights. 



















###### 7 









He does not take his eyes off the righteous; he enthrones them with kings and exalts them forever. 



















###### 8 









But if people are bound in chains, held fast by cords of affliction, 



















###### 9 









he tells them what they have done-- that they have sinned arrogantly. 



















###### 10 









He makes them listen to correction and commands them to repent of their evil. 



















###### 11 









If they obey and serve him, they will spend the rest of their days in prosperity and their years in contentment. 



















###### 12 









But if they do not listen, they will perish by the sword[^a] and die without knowledge. 



















###### 13 









"The godless in heart harbor resentment; even when he fetters them, they do not cry for help. 



















###### 14 









They die in their youth, among male prostitutes of the shrines. 



















###### 15 









But those who suffer he delivers in their suffering; he speaks to them in their affliction. 



















###### 16 









"He is wooing you from the jaws of distress to a spacious place free from restriction, to the comfort of your table laden with choice food. 



















###### 17 









But now you are laden with the judgment due the wicked; judgment and justice have taken hold of you. 



















###### 18 









Be careful that no one entices you by riches; do not let a large bribe turn you aside. 



















###### 19 









Would your wealth or even all your mighty efforts sustain you so you would not be in distress? 



















###### 20 









Do not long for the night, to drag people away from their homes.[^b] 



















###### 21 









Beware of turning to evil, which you seem to prefer to affliction. 



















###### 22 









"God is exalted in his power. Who is a teacher like him? 



















###### 23 









Who has prescribed his ways for him, or said to him, 'You have done wrong'? 



















###### 24 









Remember to extol his work, which people have praised in song. 



















###### 25 









All humanity has seen it; mortals gaze on it from afar. 



















###### 26 









How great is God--beyond our understanding! The number of his years is past finding out. 



















###### 27 









"He draws up the drops of water, which distill as rain to the streams[^c]; 



















###### 28 









the clouds pour down their moisture and abundant showers fall on mankind. 



















###### 29 









Who can understand how he spreads out the clouds, how he thunders from his pavilion? 



















###### 30 









See how he scatters his lightning about him, bathing the depths of the sea. 



















###### 31 









This is the way he governs[^d] the nations and provides food in abundance. 



















###### 32 









He fills his hands with lightning and commands it to strike its mark. 



















###### 33 









His thunder announces the coming storm; even the cattle make known its approach.[^e] NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

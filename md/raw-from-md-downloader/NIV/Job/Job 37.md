# Job 37

***




















###### 1 









"At this my heart pounds and leaps from its place. 



















###### 2 









Listen! Listen to the roar of his voice, to the rumbling that comes from his mouth. 



















###### 3 









He unleashes his lightning beneath the whole heaven and sends it to the ends of the earth. 



















###### 4 









After that comes the sound of his roar; he thunders with his majestic voice. When his voice resounds, he holds nothing back. 



















###### 5 









God's voice thunders in marvelous ways; he does great things beyond our understanding. 



















###### 6 









He says to the snow, 'Fall on the earth,' and to the rain shower, 'Be a mighty downpour.' 



















###### 7 









So that everyone he has made may know his work, he stops all people from their labor.[^a] 



















###### 8 









The animals take cover; they remain in their dens. 



















###### 9 









The tempest comes out from its chamber, the cold from the driving winds. 



















###### 10 









The breath of God produces ice, and the broad waters become frozen. 



















###### 11 









He loads the clouds with moisture; he scatters his lightning through them. 



















###### 12 









At his direction they swirl around over the face of the whole earth to do whatever he commands them. 



















###### 13 









He brings the clouds to punish people, or to water his earth and show his love. 



















###### 14 









"Listen to this, Job; stop and consider God's wonders. 



















###### 15 









Do you know how God controls the clouds and makes his lightning flash? 



















###### 16 









Do you know how the clouds hang poised, those wonders of him who has perfect knowledge? 



















###### 17 









You who swelter in your clothes when the land lies hushed under the south wind, 



















###### 18 









can you join him in spreading out the skies, hard as a mirror of cast bronze? 



















###### 19 









"Tell us what we should say to him; we cannot draw up our case because of our darkness. 



















###### 20 









Should he be told that I want to speak? Would anyone ask to be swallowed up? 



















###### 21 









Now no one can look at the sun, bright as it is in the skies after the wind has swept them clean. 



















###### 22 









Out of the north he comes in golden splendor; God comes in awesome majesty. 



















###### 23 









The Almighty is beyond our reach and exalted in power; in his justice and great righteousness, he does not oppress. 



















###### 24 









Therefore, people revere him, for does he not have regard for all the wise in heart?[^b]" NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

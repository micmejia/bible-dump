# Job 38

***




















###### 1 









Then the LORD spoke to Job out of the storm. He said: 



















###### 2 









"Who is this that obscures my plans with words without knowledge? 



















###### 3 









Brace yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall answer me. 



















###### 4 









"Where were you when I laid the earth's foundation? Tell me, if you understand. 



















###### 5 









Who marked off its dimensions? Surely you know! Who stretched a measuring line across it? 



















###### 6 









On what were its footings set, or who laid its cornerstone-- 



















###### 7 









while the morning stars sang together and all the angels[^a] shouted for joy? 



















###### 8 









"Who shut up the sea behind doors when it burst forth from the womb, 



















###### 9 









when I made the clouds its garment and wrapped it in thick darkness, 



















###### 10 









when I fixed limits for it and set its doors and bars in place, 



















###### 11 









when I said, 'This far you may come and no farther; here is where your proud waves halt'? 



















###### 12 









"Have you ever given orders to the morning, or shown the dawn its place, 



















###### 13 









that it might take the earth by the edges and shake the wicked out of it? 



















###### 14 









The earth takes shape like clay under a seal; its features stand out like those of a garment. 



















###### 15 









The wicked are denied their light, and their upraised arm is broken. 



















###### 16 









"Have you journeyed to the springs of the sea or walked in the recesses of the deep? 



















###### 17 









Have the gates of death been shown to you? Have you seen the gates of the deepest darkness? 



















###### 18 









Have you comprehended the vast expanses of the earth? Tell me, if you know all this. 



















###### 19 









"What is the way to the abode of light? And where does darkness reside? 



















###### 20 









Can you take them to their places? Do you know the paths to their dwellings? 



















###### 21 









Surely you know, for you were already born! You have lived so many years! 



















###### 22 









"Have you entered the storehouses of the snow or seen the storehouses of the hail, 



















###### 23 









which I reserve for times of trouble, for days of war and battle? 



















###### 24 









What is the way to the place where the lightning is dispersed, or the place where the east winds are scattered over the earth? 



















###### 25 









Who cuts a channel for the torrents of rain, and a path for the thunderstorm, 



















###### 26 









to water a land where no one lives, an uninhabited desert, 



















###### 27 









to satisfy a desolate wasteland and make it sprout with grass? 



















###### 28 









Does the rain have a father? Who fathers the drops of dew? 



















###### 29 









From whose womb comes the ice? Who gives birth to the frost from the heavens 



















###### 30 









when the waters become hard as stone, when the surface of the deep is frozen? 



















###### 31 









"Can you bind the chains[^b] of the Pleiades? Can you loosen Orion's belt? 



















###### 32 









Can you bring forth the constellations in their seasons[^c] or lead out the Bear[^d] with its cubs? 



















###### 33 









Do you know the laws of the heavens? Can you set up God's[^e] dominion over the earth? 



















###### 34 









"Can you raise your voice to the clouds and cover yourself with a flood of water? 



















###### 35 









Do you send the lightning bolts on their way? Do they report to you, 'Here we are'? 



















###### 36 









Who gives the ibis wisdom[^f] or gives the rooster understanding?[^g] 



















###### 37 









Who has the wisdom to count the clouds? Who can tip over the water jars of the heavens 



















###### 38 









when the dust becomes hard and the clods of earth stick together? 



















###### 39 









"Do you hunt the prey for the lioness and satisfy the hunger of the lions 



















###### 40 









when they crouch in their dens or lie in wait in a thicket? 



















###### 41

# Job 39

***




















###### 1 









"Do you know when the mountain goats give birth? Do you watch when the doe bears her fawn? 



















###### 2 









Do you count the months till they bear? Do you know the time they give birth? 



















###### 3 









They crouch down and bring forth their young; their labor pains are ended. 



















###### 4 









Their young thrive and grow strong in the wilds; they leave and do not return. 



















###### 5 









"Who let the wild donkey go free? Who untied its ropes? 



















###### 6 









I gave it the wasteland as its home, the salt flats as its habitat. 



















###### 7 









It laughs at the commotion in the town; it does not hear a driver's shout. 



















###### 8 









It ranges the hills for its pasture and searches for any green thing. 



















###### 9 









"Will the wild ox consent to serve you? Will it stay by your manger at night? 



















###### 10 









Can you hold it to the furrow with a harness? Will it till the valleys behind you? 



















###### 11 









Will you rely on it for its great strength? Will you leave your heavy work to it? 



















###### 12 









Can you trust it to haul in your grain and bring it to your threshing floor? 



















###### 13 









"The wings of the ostrich flap joyfully, though they cannot compare with the wings and feathers of the stork. 



















###### 14 









She lays her eggs on the ground and lets them warm in the sand, 



















###### 15 









unmindful that a foot may crush them, that some wild animal may trample them. 



















###### 16 









She treats her young harshly, as if they were not hers; she cares not that her labor was in vain, 



















###### 17 









for God did not endow her with wisdom or give her a share of good sense. 



















###### 18 









Yet when she spreads her feathers to run, she laughs at horse and rider. 



















###### 19 









"Do you give the horse its strength or clothe its neck with a flowing mane? 



















###### 20 









Do you make it leap like a locust, striking terror with its proud snorting? 



















###### 21 









It paws fiercely, rejoicing in its strength, and charges into the fray. 



















###### 22 









It laughs at fear, afraid of nothing; it does not shy away from the sword. 



















###### 23 









The quiver rattles against its side, along with the flashing spear and lance. 



















###### 24 









In frenzied excitement it eats up the ground; it cannot stand still when the trumpet sounds. 



















###### 25 









At the blast of the trumpet it snorts, 'Aha!' It catches the scent of battle from afar, the shout of commanders and the battle cry. 



















###### 26 









"Does the hawk take flight by your wisdom and spread its wings toward the south? 



















###### 27 









Does the eagle soar at your command and build its nest on high? 



















###### 28 









It dwells on a cliff and stays there at night; a rocky crag is its stronghold. 



















###### 29 









From there it looks for food; its eyes detect it from afar. 



















###### 30 









Its young ones feast on blood, and where the slain are, there it is." NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

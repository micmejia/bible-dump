# Job 4

***




















###### 1 









Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied: 



















###### 2 









"If someone ventures a word with you, will you be impatient? But who can keep from speaking? 



















###### 3 









Think how you have instructed many, how you have strengthened feeble hands. 



















###### 4 









Your words have supported those who stumbled; you have strengthened faltering knees. 



















###### 5 









But now trouble comes to you, and you are discouraged; it strikes you, and you are dismayed. 



















###### 6 









Should not your piety be your confidence and your blameless ways your hope? 



















###### 7 









"Consider now: Who, being innocent, has ever perished? Where were the upright ever destroyed? 



















###### 8 









As I have observed, those who plow evil and those who sow trouble reap it. 



















###### 9 









At the breath of God they perish; at the blast of his anger they are no more. 



















###### 10 









The lions may roar and growl, yet the teeth of the great lions are broken. 



















###### 11 









The lion perishes for lack of prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered. 



















###### 12 









"A word was secretly brought to me, my ears caught a whisper of it. 



















###### 13

###### 14 









fear and trembling seized me and made all my bones shake. 



















###### 15 









A spirit glided past my face, and the hair on my body stood on end. 



















###### 16 









It stopped, but I could not tell what it was. A form stood before my eyes, and I heard a hushed voice: 



















###### 17 









'Can a mortal be more righteous than God? Can even a strong man be more pure than his Maker? 



















###### 18 









If God places no trust in his servants, if he charges his angels with error, 



















###### 19 









how much more those who live in houses of clay, whose foundations are in the dust, who are crushed more readily than a moth! 



















###### 20 









Between dawn and dusk they are broken to pieces; unnoticed, they perish forever. 



















###### 21 









Are not the cords of their tent pulled up, so that they die without wisdom?' NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

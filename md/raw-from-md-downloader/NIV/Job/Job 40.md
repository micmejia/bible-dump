# Job 40

***




















###### 1 









The LORD said to Job: 



















###### 2 









"Will the one who contends with the Almighty correct him? Let him who accuses God answer him!" 



















###### 3 









Then Job answered the LORD: 



















###### 4 









"I am unworthy--how can I reply to you? I put my hand over my mouth. 



















###### 5 









I spoke once, but I have no answer-- twice, but I will say no more." 



















###### 6 









Then the LORD spoke to Job out of the storm: 



















###### 7 









"Brace yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall answer me. 



















###### 8 









"Would you discredit my justice? Would you condemn me to justify yourself? 



















###### 9 









Do you have an arm like God's, and can your voice thunder like his? 



















###### 10 









Then adorn yourself with glory and splendor, and clothe yourself in honor and majesty. 



















###### 11 









Unleash the fury of your wrath, look at all who are proud and bring them low, 



















###### 12 









look at all who are proud and humble them, crush the wicked where they stand. 



















###### 13 









Bury them all in the dust together; shroud their faces in the grave. 



















###### 14 









Then I myself will admit to you that your own right hand can save you. 



















###### 15 









"Look at Behemoth, which I made along with you and which feeds on grass like an ox. 



















###### 16 









What strength it has in its loins, what power in the muscles of its belly! 



















###### 17 









Its tail sways like a cedar; the sinews of its thighs are close-knit. 



















###### 18 









Its bones are tubes of bronze, its limbs like rods of iron. 



















###### 19 









It ranks first among the works of God, yet its Maker can approach it with his sword. 



















###### 20 









The hills bring it their produce, and all the wild animals play nearby. 



















###### 21 









Under the lotus plants it lies, hidden among the reeds in the marsh. 



















###### 22 









The lotuses conceal it in their shadow; the poplars by the stream surround it. 



















###### 23 









A raging river does not alarm it; it is secure, though the Jordan should surge against its mouth. 



















###### 24 









Can anyone capture it by the eyes, or trap it and pierce its nose? NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

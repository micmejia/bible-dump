# Job 41

***




















###### 1 









[^a]"Can you pull in Leviathan with a fishhook or tie down its tongue with a rope? 



















###### 2 









Can you put a cord through its nose or pierce its jaw with a hook? 



















###### 3 









Will it keep begging you for mercy? Will it speak to you with gentle words? 



















###### 4 









Will it make an agreement with you for you to take it as your slave for life? 



















###### 5 









Can you make a pet of it like a bird or put it on a leash for the young women in your house? 



















###### 6 









Will traders barter for it? Will they divide it up among the merchants? 



















###### 7 









Can you fill its hide with harpoons or its head with fishing spears? 



















###### 8 









If you lay a hand on it, you will remember the struggle and never do it again! 



















###### 9 









Any hope of subduing it is false; the mere sight of it is overpowering. 



















###### 10 









No one is fierce enough to rouse it. Who then is able to stand against me? 



















###### 11 









Who has a claim against me that I must pay? Everything under heaven belongs to me. 



















###### 12 









"I will not fail to speak of Leviathan's limbs, its strength and its graceful form. 



















###### 13 









Who can strip off its outer coat? Who can penetrate its double coat of armor[^b]? 



















###### 14 









Who dares open the doors of its mouth, ringed about with fearsome teeth? 



















###### 15 









Its back has[^c] rows of shields tightly sealed together; 



















###### 16 









each is so close to the next that no air can pass between. 



















###### 17 









They are joined fast to one another; they cling together and cannot be parted. 



















###### 18 









Its snorting throws out flashes of light; its eyes are like the rays of dawn. 



















###### 19 









Flames stream from its mouth; sparks of fire shoot out. 



















###### 20 









Smoke pours from its nostrils as from a boiling pot over burning reeds. 



















###### 21 









Its breath sets coals ablaze, and flames dart from its mouth. 



















###### 22 









Strength resides in its neck; dismay goes before it. 



















###### 23 









The folds of its flesh are tightly joined; they are firm and immovable. 



















###### 24 









Its chest is hard as rock, hard as a lower millstone. 



















###### 25 









When it rises up, the mighty are terrified; they retreat before its thrashing. 



















###### 26 









The sword that reaches it has no effect, nor does the spear or the dart or the javelin. 



















###### 27 









Iron it treats like straw and bronze like rotten wood. 



















###### 28 









Arrows do not make it flee; slingstones are like chaff to it. 



















###### 29 









A club seems to it but a piece of straw; it laughs at the rattling of the lance. 



















###### 30 









Its undersides are jagged potsherds, leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing sledge. 



















###### 31 









It makes the depths churn like a boiling caldron and stirs up the sea like a pot of ointment. 



















###### 32 









It leaves a glistening wake behind it; one would think the deep had white hair. 



















###### 33 









Nothing on earth is its equal-- a creature without fear. 



















###### 34 









It looks down on all that are haughty; it is king over all that are proud." NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

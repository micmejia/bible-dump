# Job 6

***




















###### 1 









Then Job replied: 



















###### 2 









"If only my anguish could be weighed and all my misery be placed on the scales! 



















###### 3 









It would surely outweigh the sand of the seas-- no wonder my words have been impetuous. 



















###### 4 









The arrows of the Almighty are in me, my spirit drinks in their poison; God's terrors are marshaled against me. 



















###### 5 









Does a wild donkey bray when it has grass, or an ox bellow when it has fodder? 



















###### 6 









Is tasteless food eaten without salt, or is there flavor in the sap of the mallow[^a]? 



















###### 7 









I refuse to touch it; such food makes me ill. 



















###### 8 









"Oh, that I might have my request, that God would grant what I hope for, 



















###### 9 









that God would be willing to crush me, to let loose his hand and cut off my life! 



















###### 10 









Then I would still have this consolation-- my joy in unrelenting pain-- that I had not denied the words of the Holy One. 



















###### 11 









"What strength do I have, that I should still hope? What prospects, that I should be patient? 



















###### 12 









Do I have the strength of stone? Is my flesh bronze? 



















###### 13 









Do I have any power to help myself, now that success has been driven from me? 



















###### 14 









"Anyone who withholds kindness from a friend forsakes the fear of the Almighty. 



















###### 15 









But my brothers are as undependable as intermittent streams, as the streams that overflow 



















###### 16 









when darkened by thawing ice and swollen with melting snow, 



















###### 17 









but that stop flowing in the dry season, and in the heat vanish from their channels. 



















###### 18 









Caravans turn aside from their routes; they go off into the wasteland and perish. 



















###### 19 









The caravans of Tema look for water, the traveling merchants of Sheba look in hope. 



















###### 20 









They are distressed, because they had been confident; they arrive there, only to be disappointed. 



















###### 21 









Now you too have proved to be of no help; you see something dreadful and are afraid. 



















###### 22 









Have I ever said, 'Give something on my behalf, pay a ransom for me from your wealth, 



















###### 23 









deliver me from the hand of the enemy, rescue me from the clutches of the ruthless'? 



















###### 24 









"Teach me, and I will be quiet; show me where I have been wrong. 



















###### 25 









How painful are honest words! But what do your arguments prove? 



















###### 26 









Do you mean to correct what I say, and treat my desperate words as wind? 



















###### 27 









You would even cast lots for the fatherless and barter away your friend. 



















###### 28 









"But now be so kind as to look at me. Would I lie to your face? 



















###### 29 









Relent, do not be unjust; reconsider, for my integrity is at stake.[^b] 



















###### 30 









Is there any wickedness on my lips? Can my mouth not discern malice? NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

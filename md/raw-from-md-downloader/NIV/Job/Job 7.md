# Job 7

***




















###### 1 









"Do not mortals have hard service on earth? Are not their days like those of hired laborers? 



















###### 2 









Like a slave longing for the evening shadows, or a hired laborer waiting to be paid, 



















###### 3 









so I have been allotted months of futility, and nights of misery have been assigned to me. 



















###### 4 









When I lie down I think, 'How long before I get up?' The night drags on, and I toss and turn until dawn. 



















###### 5 









My body is clothed with worms and scabs, my skin is broken and festering. 



















###### 6 









"My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and they come to an end without hope. 



















###### 7 









Remember, O God, that my life is but a breath; my eyes will never see happiness again. 



















###### 8 









The eye that now sees me will see me no longer; you will look for me, but I will be no more. 



















###### 9 









As a cloud vanishes and is gone, so one who goes down to the grave does not return. 



















###### 10 









He will never come to his house again; his place will know him no more. 



















###### 11 









"Therefore I will not keep silent; I will speak out in the anguish of my spirit, I will complain in the bitterness of my soul. 



















###### 12 









Am I the sea, or the monster of the deep, that you put me under guard? 



















###### 13 









When I think my bed will comfort me and my couch will ease my complaint, 



















###### 14 









even then you frighten me with dreams and terrify me with visions, 



















###### 15 









so that I prefer strangling and death, rather than this body of mine. 



















###### 16 









I despise my life; I would not live forever. Let me alone; my days have no meaning. 



















###### 17 









"What is mankind that you make so much of them, that you give them so much attention, 



















###### 18 









that you examine them every morning and test them every moment? 



















###### 19 









Will you never look away from me, or let me alone even for an instant? 



















###### 20 









If I have sinned, what have I done to you, you who see everything we do? Why have you made me your target? Have I become a burden to you?[^a] 



















###### 21 









Why do you not pardon my offenses and forgive my sins? For I will soon lie down in the dust; you will search for me, but I will be no more."

# Job 8

***




















###### 1 









Then Bildad the Shuhite replied: 



















###### 2 









"How long will you say such things? Your words are a blustering wind. 



















###### 3 









Does God pervert justice? Does the Almighty pervert what is right? 



















###### 4 









When your children sinned against him, he gave them over to the penalty of their sin. 



















###### 5 









But if you will seek God earnestly and plead with the Almighty, 



















###### 6 









if you are pure and upright, even now he will rouse himself on your behalf and restore you to your prosperous state. 



















###### 7 









Your beginnings will seem humble, so prosperous will your future be. 



















###### 8 









"Ask the former generation and find out what their ancestors learned, 



















###### 9 









for we were born only yesterday and know nothing, and our days on earth are but a shadow. 



















###### 10 









Will they not instruct you and tell you? Will they not bring forth words from their understanding? 



















###### 11 









Can papyrus grow tall where there is no marsh? Can reeds thrive without water? 



















###### 12 









While still growing and uncut, they wither more quickly than grass. 



















###### 13 









Such is the destiny of all who forget God; so perishes the hope of the godless. 



















###### 14 









What they trust in is fragile[^a]; what they rely on is a spider's web. 



















###### 15 









They lean on the web, but it gives way; they cling to it, but it does not hold. 



















###### 16 









They are like a well-watered plant in the sunshine, spreading its shoots over the garden; 



















###### 17 









it entwines its roots around a pile of rocks and looks for a place among the stones. 



















###### 18 









But when it is torn from its spot, that place disowns it and says, 'I never saw you.' 



















###### 19 









Surely its life withers away, and[^b] from the soil other plants grow. 



















###### 20 









"Surely God does not reject one who is blameless or strengthen the hands of evildoers. 



















###### 21 









He will yet fill your mouth with laughter and your lips with shouts of joy. 



















###### 22 









Your enemies will be clothed in shame, and the tents of the wicked will be no more." NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

# Job 9

***




















###### 1 









Then Job replied: 



















###### 2 









"Indeed, I know that this is true. But how can mere mortals prove their innocence before God? 



















###### 3 









Though they wished to dispute with him, they could not answer him one time out of a thousand. 



















###### 4 









His wisdom is profound, his power is vast. Who has resisted him and come out unscathed? 



















###### 5 









He moves mountains without their knowing it and overturns them in his anger. 



















###### 6 









He shakes the earth from its place and makes its pillars tremble. 



















###### 7 









He speaks to the sun and it does not shine; he seals off the light of the stars. 



















###### 8 









He alone stretches out the heavens and treads on the waves of the sea. 



















###### 9 









He is the Maker of the Bear[^a] and Orion, the Pleiades and the constellations of the south. 



















###### 10 









He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed, miracles that cannot be counted. 



















###### 11 









When he passes me, I cannot see him; when he goes by, I cannot perceive him. 



















###### 12 









If he snatches away, who can stop him? Who can say to him, 'What are you doing?' 



















###### 13 









God does not restrain his anger; even the cohorts of Rahab cowered at his feet. 



















###### 14 









"How then can I dispute with him? How can I find words to argue with him? 



















###### 15 









Though I were innocent, I could not answer him; I could only plead with my Judge for mercy. 



















###### 16 









Even if I summoned him and he responded, I do not believe he would give me a hearing. 



















###### 17 









He would crush me with a storm and multiply my wounds for no reason. 



















###### 18 









He would not let me catch my breath but would overwhelm me with misery. 



















###### 19 









If it is a matter of strength, he is mighty! And if it is a matter of justice, who can challenge him[^b]? 



















###### 20 









Even if I were innocent, my mouth would condemn me; if I were blameless, it would pronounce me guilty. 



















###### 21 









"Although I am blameless, I have no concern for myself; I despise my own life. 



















###### 22 









It is all the same; that is why I say, 'He destroys both the blameless and the wicked.' 



















###### 23 









When a scourge brings sudden death, he mocks the despair of the innocent. 



















###### 24 









When a land falls into the hands of the wicked, he blindfolds its judges. If it is not he, then who is it? 



















###### 25 









"My days are swifter than a runner; they fly away without a glimpse of joy. 



















###### 26 









They skim past like boats of papyrus, like eagles swooping down on their prey. 



















###### 27 









If I say, 'I will forget my complaint, I will change my expression, and smile,' 



















###### 28 









I still dread all my sufferings, for I know you will not hold me innocent. 



















###### 29 









Since I am already found guilty, why should I struggle in vain? 



















###### 30 









Even if I washed myself with soap and my hands with cleansing powder, 



















###### 31 









you would plunge me into a slime pit so that even my clothes would detest me. 



















###### 32 









"He is not a mere mortal like me that I might answer him, that we might confront each other in court. 



















###### 33 









If only there were someone to mediate between us, someone to bring us together, 



















###### 34 









someone to remove God's rod from me, so that his terror would frighten me no more. 



















###### 35 









Then I would speak up without fear of him, but as it now stands with me, I cannot. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

***




















###### 1 









The word of the LORD that came to Joel son of Pethuel. ## An Invasion of Locusts 



















###### 2 









Hear this, you elders; listen, all who live in the land. Has anything like this ever happened in your days or in the days of your ancestors? 



















###### 3 









Tell it to your children, and let your children tell it to their children, and their children to the next generation. 



















###### 4 









What the locust swarm has left the great locusts have eaten; what the great locusts have left the young locusts have eaten; what the young locusts have left other locusts[^a] have eaten. 



















###### 5 









Wake up, you drunkards, and weep! Wail, all you drinkers of wine; wail because of the new wine, for it has been snatched from your lips. 



















###### 6 









A nation has invaded my land, a mighty army without number; it has the teeth of a lion, the fangs of a lioness. 



















###### 7 









It has laid waste my vines and ruined my fig trees. It has stripped off their bark and thrown it away, leaving their branches white. 



















###### 8 









Mourn like a virgin in sackcloth grieving for the betrothed of her youth. 



















###### 9 









Grain offerings and drink offerings are cut off from the house of the LORD. The priests are in mourning, those who minister before the LORD. 



















###### 10 









The fields are ruined, the ground is dried up; the grain is destroyed, the new wine is dried up, the olive oil fails. 



















###### 11 









Despair, you farmers, wail, you vine growers; grieve for the wheat and the barley, because the harvest of the field is destroyed. 



















###### 12 









The vine is dried up and the fig tree is withered; the pomegranate, the palm and the apple[^b] tree-- all the trees of the field--are dried up. Surely the people's joy is withered away. ## A Call to Lamentation 



















###### 13 









Put on sackcloth, you priests, and mourn; wail, you who minister before the altar. Come, spend the night in sackcloth, you who minister before my God; for the grain offerings and drink offerings are withheld from the house of your God. 



















###### 14 









Declare a holy fast; call a sacred assembly. Summon the elders and all who live in the land to the house of the LORD your God, and cry out to the LORD. 



















###### 15 









Alas for that day! For the day of the LORD is near; it will come like destruction from the Almighty.[^c] 



















###### 16 









Has not the food been cut off before our very eyes-- joy and gladness from the house of our God? 



















###### 17 









The seeds are shriveled beneath the clods.[^d] The storehouses are in ruins, the granaries have been broken down, for the grain has dried up. 



















###### 18 









How the cattle moan! The herds mill about because they have no pasture; even the flocks of sheep are suffering. 



















###### 19 









To you, LORD, I call, for fire has devoured the pastures in the wilderness and flames have burned up all the trees of the field. 



















###### 20 









Even the wild animals pant for you; the streams of water have dried up and fire has devoured the pastures in the wilderness. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

# Joel 3

***




















###### 1 









[^a]"In those days and at that time, when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem, 



















###### 2 









I will gather all nations and bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat.[^b] There I will put them on trial for what they did to my inheritance, my people Israel, because they scattered my people among the nations and divided up my land. 



















###### 3 









They cast lots for my people and traded boys for prostitutes; they sold girls for wine to drink. 



















###### 4 









"Now what have you against me, Tyre and Sidon and all you regions of Philistia? Are you repaying me for something I have done? If you are paying me back, I will swiftly and speedily return on your own heads what you have done. 



















###### 5 









For you took my silver and my gold and carried off my finest treasures to your temples.[^c] 



















###### 6 









You sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks, that you might send them far from their homeland. 



















###### 7 









"See, I am going to rouse them out of the places to which you sold them, and I will return on your own heads what you have done. 



















###### 8 









I will sell your sons and daughters to the people of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans, a nation far away." The LORD has spoken. 



















###### 9 









Proclaim this among the nations: Prepare for war! Rouse the warriors! Let all the fighting men draw near and attack. 



















###### 10 









Beat your plowshares into swords and your pruning hooks into spears. Let the weakling say, "I am strong!" 



















###### 11 









Come quickly, all you nations from every side, and assemble there. Bring down your warriors, LORD! 



















###### 12 









"Let the nations be roused; let them advance into the Valley of Jehoshaphat, for there I will sit to judge all the nations on every side. 



















###### 13 









Swing the sickle, for the harvest is ripe. Come, trample the grapes, for the winepress is full and the vats overflow-- so great is their wickedness!" 



















###### 14 









Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision. 



















###### 15 









The sun and moon will be darkened, and the stars no longer shine. 



















###### 16 









The LORD will roar from Zion and thunder from Jerusalem; the earth and the heavens will tremble. But the LORD will be a refuge for his people, a stronghold for the people of Israel. ## Blessings for God's People 



















###### 17 









"Then you will know that I, the LORD your God, dwell in Zion, my holy hill. Jerusalem will be holy; never again will foreigners invade her. 



















###### 18 









"In that day the mountains will drip new wine, and the hills will flow with milk; all the ravines of Judah will run with water. A fountain will flow out of the LORD's house and will water the valley of acacias.[^d] 



















###### 19 









But Egypt will be desolate, Edom a desert waste, because of violence done to the people of Judah, in whose land they shed innocent blood. 



















###### 20 









Judah will be inhabited forever and Jerusalem through all generations. 



















###### 21 









Shall I leave their innocent blood unavenged? No, I will not." The LORD dwells in Zion! NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

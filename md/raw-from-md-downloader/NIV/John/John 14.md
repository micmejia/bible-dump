# John 14

***




















###### 1 









"Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God[^a]; believe also in me. 



















###### 2 









My Father's house has many rooms; if that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you? 



















###### 3 









And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am. 



















###### 4 









You know the way to the place where I am going." ## Jesus the Way to the Father 



















###### 5 









Thomas said to him, "Lord, we don't know where you are going, so how can we know the way?" 



















###### 6 









Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. 



















###### 7 









If you really know me, you will know[^b] my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him." 



















###### 8 









Philip said, "Lord, show us the Father and that will be enough for us." 



















###### 9 









Jesus answered: "Don't you know me, Philip, even after I have been among you such a long time? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, 'Show us the Father'? 



















###### 10 









Don't you believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words I say to you I do not speak on my own authority. Rather, it is the Father, living in me, who is doing his work. 



















###### 11 









Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; or at least believe on the evidence of the works themselves. 



















###### 12 









Very truly I tell you, whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing, and they will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father. 



















###### 13 









And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. 



















###### 14 









You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it. ## Jesus Promises the Holy Spirit

###### 18 









I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you. 



















###### 19 









Before long, the world will not see me anymore, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live. 



















###### 20 









On that day you will realize that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you. 



















###### 21 









Whoever has my commands and keeps them is the one who loves me. The one who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I too will love them and show myself to them." 



















###### 22 









Then Judas (not Judas Iscariot) said, "But, Lord, why do you intend to show yourself to us and not to the world?" 



















###### 23 









Jesus replied, "Anyone who loves me will obey my teaching. My Father will love them, and we will come to them and make our home with them. 



















###### 24

But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you. 



















###### 27 









Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid. 



















###### 28 









"You heard me say, 'I am going away and I am coming back to you.' If you loved me, you would be glad that I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I. 



















###### 29 









I have told you now before it happens, so that when it does happen you will believe.

I will not say much more to you, for the prince of this world is coming. He has no hold over me,

# John 17

***




















###### 1 









After Jesus said this, he looked toward heaven and prayed: "Father, the hour has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son may glorify you. 



















###### 2 









For you granted him authority over all people that he might give eternal life to all those you have given him. 



















###### 3 









Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent. 



















###### 4 









I have brought you glory on earth by finishing the work you gave me to do. 



















###### 5 









And now, Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began. ## Jesus Prays for His Disciples 



















###### 6 









"I have revealed you[^a] to those whom you gave me out of the world. They were yours; you gave them to me and they have obeyed your word. 



















###### 7 









Now they know that everything you have given me comes from you. 



















###### 8 









For I gave them the words you gave me and they accepted them. They knew with certainty that I came from you, and they believed that you sent me. 



















###### 9 









I pray for them. I am not praying for the world, but for those you have given me, for they are yours. 



















###### 10 









All I have is yours, and all you have is mine. And glory has come to me through them. 



















###### 11 









I will remain in the world no longer, but they are still in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, protect them by the power of[^b] your name, the name you gave me, so that they may be one as we are one. 



















###### 12 









While I was with them, I protected them and kept them safe by[^c] that name you gave me. None has been lost except the one doomed to destruction so that Scripture would be fulfilled. 



















###### 13 









"I am coming to you now, but I say these things while I am still in the world, so that they may have the full measure of my joy within them. 



















###### 14 









I have given them your word and the world has hated them, for they are not of the world any more than I am of the world. 



















###### 15 









My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one. 



















###### 16 









They are not of the world, even as I am not of it. 



















###### 17 









Sanctify them by[^d] the truth; your word is truth. 



















###### 18 









As you sent me into the world, I have sent them into the world. 



















###### 19 









For them I sanctify myself, that they too may be truly sanctified. ## Jesus Prays for All Believers 



















###### 20 









"My prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message, 



















###### 21 









that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me. 



















###### 22 









I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one-- 



















###### 23 









I in them and you in me--so that they may be brought to complete unity. Then the world will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me. 



















###### 24 









"Father, I want those you have given me to be with me where I am, and to see my glory, the glory you have given me because you loved me before the creation of the world. 



















###### 25 









"Righteous Father, though the world does not know you, I know you, and they know that you have sent me. 



















###### 26 









I have made you[^e] known to them, and will continue to make you known in order that the love you have for me may be in them and that I myself may be in them."

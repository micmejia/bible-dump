# John 5

***




















###### 1 









Some time later, Jesus went up to Jerusalem for one of the Jewish festivals. 



















###### 2 









Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool, which in Aramaic is called Bethesda[^a] and which is surrounded by five covered colonnades. 



















###### 3 









Here a great number of disabled people used to lie--the blind, the lame, the paralyzed. <sup class="versenum">[4]</sup>[^b] 



















###### 5 









One who was there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years. 



















###### 6 









When Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time, he asked him, "Do you want to get well?" 



















###### 7 









"Sir," the invalid replied, "I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me." 



















###### 8 









Then Jesus said to him, "Get up! Pick up your mat and walk." 



















###### 9 









At once the man was cured; he picked up his mat and walked. The day on which this took place was a Sabbath, 



















###### 10 









and so the Jewish leaders said to the man who had been healed, "It is the Sabbath; the law forbids you to carry your mat." 



















###### 11 









But he replied, "The man who made me well said to me, 'Pick up your mat and walk.' " 



















###### 12 









So they asked him, "Who is this fellow who told you to pick it up and walk?" 



















###### 13 









The man who was healed had no idea who it was, for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there. 



















###### 14 









Later Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, "See, you are well again. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you." 



















###### 15 









The man went away and told the Jewish leaders that it was Jesus who had made him well. ## The Authority of the Son 



















###### 16 









So, because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jewish leaders began to persecute him. 



















###### 17 









In his defense Jesus said to them, "My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I too am working." 



















###### 18 









For this reason they tried all the more to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God. 



















###### 19 









Jesus gave them this answer: "Very truly I tell you, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does. 



















###### 20 









For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does. Yes, and he will show him even greater works than these, so that you will be amazed. 



















###### 21 









For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it. 



















###### 22 









Moreover, the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son, 



















###### 23 









that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father, who sent him. 



















###### 24 









"Very truly I tell you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be judged but has crossed over from death to life. 



















###### 25 









Very truly I tell you, a time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live. 



















###### 26 









For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself. 



















###### 27 









And he has given him authority to judge because he is the Son of Man. 



















###### 28 









"Do not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice 



















###### 29 









and come out--those who have done what is good will rise to live, and those who have done what is evil will rise to be condemned. 



















###### 30 









By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me. ## Testimonies About Jesus 



















###### 31 









"If I testify about myself, my testimony is not true. 



















###### 32 









There is another who testifies in my favor, and I know that his testimony about me is true. 



















###### 33 









"You have sent to John and he has testified to the truth. 



















###### 34 









Not that I accept human testimony; but I mention it that you may be saved. 



















###### 35 









John was a lamp that burned and gave light, and you chose for a time to enjoy his light. 



















###### 36 









"I have testimony weightier than that of John. For the works that the Father has given me to finish--the very works that I am doing--testify that the Father has sent me. 



















###### 37 









And the Father who sent me has himself testified concerning me. You have never heard his voice nor seen his form, 



















###### 38 









nor does his word dwell in you, for you do not believe the one he sent. 



















###### 39 









You study[^c] the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life. These are the very Scriptures that testify about me, 



















###### 40 









yet you refuse to come to me to have life. 



















###### 41 









"I do not accept glory from human beings, 



















###### 42 









but I know you. I know that you do not have the love of God in your hearts. 



















###### 43 









I have come in my Father's name, and you do not accept me; but if someone else comes in his own name, you will accept him. 



















###### 44 









How can you believe since you accept glory from one another but do not seek the glory that comes from the only God[^d]? 



















###### 45 









"But do not think I will accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses, on whom your hopes are set. 



















###### 46 









If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me. 



















###### 47 









But since you do not believe what he wrote, how are you going to believe what I say?" NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

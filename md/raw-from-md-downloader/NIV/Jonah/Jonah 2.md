# Jonah 2

***
# Jonah 2 (New International Version) "In my distress I called to the LORD, and he answered me. From deep in the realm of the dead I called for help, and you listened to my cry. 



















###### 3 









You hurled me into the depths, into the very heart of the seas, and the currents swirled about me; all your waves and breakers swept over me. 



















###### 4 









I said, 'I have been banished from your sight; yet I will look again toward your holy temple.' 



















###### 5 









The engulfing waters threatened me,[^b] the deep surrounded me; seaweed was wrapped around my head. 



















###### 6 









To the roots of the mountains I sank down; the earth beneath barred me in forever. But you, LORD my God, brought my life up from the pit. 



















###### 7 









"When my life was ebbing away, I remembered you, LORD, and my prayer rose to you, to your holy temple. 



















###### 8 









"Those who cling to worthless idols turn away from God's love for them. 



















###### 9 









But I, with shouts of grateful praise, will sacrifice to you. What I have vowed I will make good. I will say, 'Salvation comes from the LORD.'" 



















###### 10

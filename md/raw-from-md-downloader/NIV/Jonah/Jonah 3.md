# Jonah 3

***




















###### 1 









Then the word of the LORD came to Jonah a second time: 



















###### 2 









"Go to the great city of Nineveh and proclaim to it the message I give you." 



















###### 3 









Jonah obeyed the word of the LORD and went to Nineveh. Now Nineveh was a very large city; it took three days to go through it. 



















###### 4 









Jonah began by going a day's journey into the city, proclaiming, "Forty more days and Nineveh will be overthrown." 



















###### 5 









The Ninevites believed God. A fast was proclaimed, and all of them, from the greatest to the least, put on sackcloth. 



















###### 6 









When Jonah's warning reached the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne, took off his royal robes, covered himself with sackcloth and sat down in the dust. 



















###### 7 









This is the proclamation he issued in Nineveh: "By the decree of the king and his nobles: Do not let people or animals, herds or flocks, taste anything; do not let them eat or drink. 



















###### 8 









But let people and animals be covered with sackcloth. Let everyone call urgently on God. Let them give up their evil ways and their violence. 



















###### 9 









Who knows? God may yet relent and with compassion turn from his fierce anger so that we will not perish." 



















###### 10 









When God saw what they did and how they turned from their evil ways, he relented and did not bring on them the destruction he had threatened.

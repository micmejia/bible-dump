When Joshua had grown old, the LORD said to him, "You are now very old, and there are still very large areas of land to be taken over. 



















###### 2 









"This is the land that remains: all the regions of the Philistines and Geshurites, 



















###### 3 









from the Shihor River on the east of Egypt to the territory of Ekron on the north, all of it counted as Canaanite though held by the five Philistine rulers in Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath and Ekron; the territory of the Avvites 



















###### 4 









on the south; all the land of the Canaanites, from Arah of the Sidonians as far as Aphek and the border of the Amorites; 



















###### 5 









the area of Byblos; and all Lebanon to the east, from Baal Gad below Mount Hermon to Lebo Hamath. 



















###### 6 









"As for all the inhabitants of the mountain regions from Lebanon to Misrephoth Maim, that is, all the Sidonians, I myself will drive them out before the Israelites. Be sure to allocate this land to Israel for an inheritance, as I have instructed you, 



















###### 7 









and divide it as an inheritance among the nine tribes and half of the tribe of Manasseh." ## Division of the Land East of the Jordan 



















###### 8 









The other half of Manasseh,[^a] the Reubenites and the Gadites had received the inheritance that Moses had given them east of the Jordan, as he, the servant of the LORD, had assigned it to them.

###### 11

###### 12 









that is, the whole kingdom of Og in Bashan, who had reigned in Ashtaroth and Edrei. (He was the last of the Rephaites.) Moses had defeated them and taken over their land. 



















###### 13 









But the Israelites did not drive out the people of Geshur and Maakah, so they continue to live among the Israelites to this day. 



















###### 14 









But to the tribe of Levi he gave no inheritance, since the food offerings presented to the LORD, the God of Israel, are their inheritance, as he promised them. 



















###### 15 









This is what Moses had given to the tribe of Reuben, according to its clans: 



















###### 16 









The territory from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge, and from the town in the middle of the gorge, and the whole plateau past Medeba

###### 20

###### 22 









In addition to those slain in battle, the Israelites had put to the sword Balaam son of Beor, who practiced divination.

The territory of Jazer, all the towns of Gilead and half the Ammonite country as far as Aroer, near Rabbah;

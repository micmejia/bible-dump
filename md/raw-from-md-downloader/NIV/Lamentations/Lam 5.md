# Lamentations 5

***




















###### 1 









Remember, LORD, what has happened to us; look, and see our disgrace. 



















###### 2 









Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, our homes to foreigners. 



















###### 3 









We have become fatherless, our mothers are widows. 



















###### 4 









We must buy the water we drink; our wood can be had only at a price. 



















###### 5 









Those who pursue us are at our heels; we are weary and find no rest. 



















###### 6 









We submitted to Egypt and Assyria to get enough bread. 



















###### 7 









Our ancestors sinned and are no more, and we bear their punishment. 



















###### 8 









Slaves rule over us, and there is no one to free us from their hands. 



















###### 9 









We get our bread at the risk of our lives because of the sword in the desert. 



















###### 10 









Our skin is hot as an oven, feverish from hunger. 



















###### 11 









Women have been violated in Zion, and virgins in the towns of Judah. 



















###### 12 









Princes have been hung up by their hands; elders are shown no respect. 



















###### 13 









Young men toil at the millstones; boys stagger under loads of wood. 



















###### 14 









The elders are gone from the city gate; the young men have stopped their music. 



















###### 15 









Joy is gone from our hearts; our dancing has turned to mourning. 



















###### 16 









The crown has fallen from our head. Woe to us, for we have sinned! 



















###### 17 









Because of this our hearts are faint, because of these things our eyes grow dim 



















###### 18 









for Mount Zion, which lies desolate, with jackals prowling over it. 



















###### 19 









You, LORD, reign forever; your throne endures from generation to generation. 



















###### 20 









Why do you always forget us? Why do you forsake us so long? 



















###### 21 









Restore us to yourself, LORD, that we may return; renew our days as of old 



















###### 22

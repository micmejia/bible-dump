"Speak to the Israelites and say to them: 'When any man has an unusual bodily discharge, such a discharge is unclean. 



















###### 3 









Whether it continues flowing from his body or is blocked, it will make him unclean. This is how his discharge will bring about uncleanness: 



















###### 4 









"'Any bed the man with a discharge lies on will be unclean, and anything he sits on will be unclean. 



















###### 5 









Anyone who touches his bed must wash their clothes and bathe with water, and they will be unclean till evening. 



















###### 6 









Whoever sits on anything that the man with a discharge sat on must wash their clothes and bathe with water, and they will be unclean till evening. 



















###### 7 









"'Whoever touches the man who has a discharge must wash their clothes and bathe with water, and they will be unclean till evening.

###### 9 









"'Everything the man sits on when riding will be unclean, 



















###### 10 









and whoever touches any of the things that were under him will be unclean till evening; whoever picks up those things must wash their clothes and bathe with water, and they will be unclean till evening. 



















###### 11 









"'Anyone the man with a discharge touches without rinsing his hands with water must wash their clothes and bathe with water, and they will be unclean till evening. 



















###### 12 









"'A clay pot that the man touches must be broken, and any wooden article is to be rinsed with water. 



















###### 13

###### 14 









On the eighth day he must take two doves or two young pigeons and come before the LORD to the entrance to the tent of meeting and give them to the priest. 



















###### 15 









The priest is to sacrifice them, the one for a sin offering[^a] and the other for a burnt offering. In this way he will make atonement before the LORD for the man because of his discharge. 



















###### 16

###### 17

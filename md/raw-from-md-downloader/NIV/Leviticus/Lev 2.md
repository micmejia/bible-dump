and take it to Aaron's sons the priests. The priest shall take a handful of the flour and oil, together with all the incense, and burn this as a memorial[^a] portion on the altar, a food offering, an aroma pleasing to the LORD. 



















###### 3 









The rest of the grain offering belongs to Aaron and his sons; it is a most holy part of the food offerings presented to the LORD. 



















###### 4 









"'If you bring a grain offering baked in an oven, it is to consist of the finest flour: either thick loaves made without yeast and with olive oil mixed in or thin loaves made without yeast and brushed with olive oil. 



















###### 5 









If your grain offering is prepared on a griddle, it is to be made of the finest flour mixed with oil, and without yeast. 



















###### 6 









Crumble it and pour oil on it; it is a grain offering. 



















###### 7 









If your grain offering is cooked in a pan, it is to be made of the finest flour and some olive oil.

Bring the grain offering made of these things to the LORD; present it to the priest, who shall take it to the altar. 



















###### 9 









He shall take out the memorial portion from the grain offering and burn it on the altar as a food offering, an aroma pleasing to the LORD. 



















###### 10 









The rest of the grain offering belongs to Aaron and his sons; it is a most holy part of the food offerings presented to the LORD. 



















###### 11 









"'Every grain offering you bring to the LORD must be made without yeast, for you are not to burn any yeast or honey in a food offering presented to the LORD. 



















###### 12 









You may bring them to the LORD as an offering of the firstfruits, but they are not to be offered on the altar as a pleasing aroma. 



















###### 13 









Season all your grain offerings with salt. Do not leave the salt of the covenant of your God out of your grain offerings; add salt to all your offerings. 



















###### 14 









"'If you bring a grain offering of firstfruits to the LORD, offer crushed heads of new grain roasted in the fire. 



















###### 15

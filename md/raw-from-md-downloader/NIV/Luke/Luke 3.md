As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet: "A voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.

###### 15 









The people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts if John might possibly be the Messiah. 



















###### 16 









John answered them all, "I baptize you with[^b] water. But one who is more powerful than I will come, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with[^c] the Holy Spirit and fire. 



















###### 17 









His winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire." 



















###### 18 









And with many other words John exhorted the people and proclaimed the good news to them. 



















###### 19 









But when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of his marriage to Herodias, his brother's wife, and all the other evil things he had done, 



















###### 20

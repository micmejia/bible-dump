***




















###### 1 









Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, left the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, 



















###### 2 









where for forty days he was tempted[^a] by the devil. He ate nothing during those days, and at the end of them he was hungry. 



















###### 3 









The devil said to him, "If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread." 



















###### 4 









Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Man shall not live on bread alone.'[^b]" 



















###### 5 









The devil led him up to a high place and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world.

###### 9 









The devil led him to Jerusalem and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. "If you are the Son of God," he said, "throw yourself down from here. 



















###### 10 









For it is written: "'He will command his angels concerning you to guard you carefully; 



















###### 11 









they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'[^d]" 



















###### 12 









Jesus answered, "It is said: 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'[^e]"

and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. Unrolling it, he found the place where it is written: 



















###### 18 









"The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free, 



















###### 19 









to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor."[^f] 



















###### 20

###### 22 









All spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his lips. "Isn't this Joseph's son?" they asked. 



















###### 23 









Jesus said to them, "Surely you will quote this proverb to me: 'Physician, heal yourself!' And you will tell me, 'Do here in your hometown what we have heard that you did in Capernaum.'" 



















###### 24 









"Truly I tell you," he continued, "no prophet is accepted in his hometown. 



















###### 25

###### 34 









"Go away! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are--the Holy One of God!"

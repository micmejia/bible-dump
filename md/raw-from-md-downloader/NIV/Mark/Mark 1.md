# Mark 1

***




















###### 1 









The beginning of the good news about Jesus the Messiah,[^a] the Son of God,[^b] 



















###### 2 









as it is written in Isaiah the prophet: "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way"[^c]-- 



















###### 3 









"a voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'"[^d] 



















###### 4 









And so John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. 



















###### 5 









The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River. 



















###### 6 









John wore clothing made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey. 



















###### 7 









And this was his message: "After me comes the one more powerful than I, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie. 



















###### 8 









I baptize you with[^e] water, but he will baptize you with[^f] the Holy Spirit." ## The Baptism and Testing of Jesus 



















###### 9 









At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. 



















###### 10 









Just as Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. 



















###### 11 









And a voice came from heaven: "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased." 



















###### 12 









At once the Spirit sent him out into the wilderness, 



















###### 13 









and he was in the wilderness forty days, being tempted[^g] by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and angels attended him. ## Jesus Announces the Good News 



















###### 14 









After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God. 



















###### 15 









"The time has come," he said. "The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!" ## Jesus Calls His First Disciples 



















###### 16 









As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen. 



















###### 17 









"Come, follow me," Jesus said, "and I will send you out to fish for people." 



















###### 18 









At once they left their nets and followed him. 



















###### 19 









When he had gone a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat, preparing their nets. 



















###### 20 









Without delay he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him. ## Jesus Drives Out an Impure Spirit 



















###### 21 









They went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach. 



















###### 22 









The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of the law. 



















###### 23 









Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an impure spirit cried out, 



















###### 24 









"What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are--the Holy One of God!" 



















###### 25 









"Be quiet!" said Jesus sternly. "Come out of him!" 



















###### 26 









The impure spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek. 



















###### 27 









The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching--and with authority! He even gives orders to impure spirits and they obey him." 



















###### 28 









News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee. ## Jesus Heals Many 



















###### 29 









As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew. 



















###### 30 









Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they immediately told Jesus about her. 



















###### 31 









So he went to her, took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her and she began to wait on them. 



















###### 32 









That evening after sunset the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed. 



















###### 33 









The whole town gathered at the door, 



















###### 34 









and Jesus healed many who had various diseases. He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was. ## Jesus Prays in a Solitary Place 



















###### 35 









Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed. 



















###### 36 









Simon and his companions went to look for him, 



















###### 37 









and when they found him, they exclaimed: "Everyone is looking for you!" 



















###### 38 









Jesus replied, "Let us go somewhere else--to the nearby villages--so I can preach there also. That is why I have come." 



















###### 39 









So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons. ## Jesus Heals a Man With Leprosy 



















###### 40 









A man with leprosy[^h] came to him and begged him on his knees, "If you are willing, you can make me clean." 



















###### 41 









Jesus was indignant.[^i] He reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be clean!" 



















###### 42 









Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cleansed. 



















###### 43 









Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning: 



















###### 44 









"See that you don't tell this to anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them." 



















###### 45 









Instead he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

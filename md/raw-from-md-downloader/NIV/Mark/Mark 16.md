# Mark 16

***




















###### 1 









When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices so that they might go to anoint Jesus' body. 



















###### 2 









Very early on the first day of the week, just after sunrise, they were on their way to the tomb 



















###### 3 









and they asked each other, "Who will roll the stone away from the entrance of the tomb?" 



















###### 4 









But when they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had been rolled away. 



















###### 5 









As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were alarmed. 



















###### 6 









"Don't be alarmed," he said. "You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid him. 



















###### 7 









But go, tell his disciples and Peter, 'He is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.'" 



















###### 8 









Trembling and bewildered, the women went out and fled from the tomb. They said nothing to anyone, because they were afraid.[^a] [The earliest manuscripts and some other ancient witnesses do not have verses 9–20.] _ 



















###### 9 









When Jesus rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene,_ _out of whom he had driven seven demons._ _ 



















###### 10 









She went and told those who had been with him and who were mourning and weeping._ _

When they heard that Jesus was alive and that she had seen him, they did not believe it._ _ 



















###### 12

###### 13 









These returned and reported it to the rest; but they did not believe them either._ _ 



















###### 14 









Later Jesus appeared to the Eleven as they were eating; he rebuked them for their lack of faith and their stubborn refusal to believe those who had seen him after he had risen._ _ 



















###### 15 









He said to them, "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation._ _ 



















###### 16 









Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned._ _ 



















###### 17 









And these signs_ _will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons;_ _they will speak in new tongues;_ _ 



















###### 18 









they will pick up snakes_ _with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on_ _sick people, and they will get well."_ _ 



















###### 19 









After the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven_ _and he sat at the right hand of God._ _ 



















###### 20 









Then the disciples went out and preached everywhere, and the Lord worked with them and confirmed his word by the signs_ _that accompanied it._ NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

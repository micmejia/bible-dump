# Mark 7

***




















###### 1 









The Pharisees and some of the teachers of the law who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus 



















###### 2 









and saw some of his disciples eating food with hands that were defiled, that is, unwashed. 



















###### 3 









(The Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they give their hands a ceremonial washing, holding to the tradition of the elders. 



















###### 4 









When they come from the marketplace they do not eat unless they wash. And they observe many other traditions, such as the washing of cups, pitchers and kettles.[^a]) 



















###### 5 









So the Pharisees and teachers of the law asked Jesus, "Why don't your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders instead of eating their food with defiled hands?" 



















###### 6 









He replied, "Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is written: "'These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. 



















###### 7 









They worship me in vain; their teachings are merely human rules.'[^b] 



















###### 8 









You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to human traditions." 



















###### 9 









And he continued, "You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe[^c] your own traditions! 



















###### 10 









For Moses said, 'Honor your father and mother,'[^d] and, 'Anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death.'[^e] 



















###### 11 









But you say that if anyone declares that what might have been used to help their father or mother is Corban (that is, devoted to God)-- 



















###### 12 









then you no longer let them do anything for their father or mother. 



















###### 13 









Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like that." 



















###### 14 









Again Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen to me, everyone, and understand this. 



















###### 15 









Nothing outside a person can defile them by going into them. Rather, it is what comes out of a person that defiles them." <sup class="versenum">[16]</sup>[^f] 



















###### 17 









After he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about this parable. 



















###### 18 









"Are you so dull?" he asked. "Don't you see that nothing that enters a person from the outside can defile them? 



















###### 19 









For it doesn't go into their heart but into their stomach, and then out of the body." (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods clean.) 



















###### 20 









He went on: "What comes out of a person is what defiles them. 



















###### 21 









For it is from within, out of a person's heart, that evil thoughts come--sexual immorality, theft, murder, 



















###### 22 









adultery, greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly. 



















###### 23 









All these evils come from inside and defile a person." ## Jesus Honors a Syrophoenician Woman's Faith 



















###### 24 









Jesus left that place and went to the vicinity of Tyre.[^g] He entered a house and did not want anyone to know it; yet he could not keep his presence secret. 



















###### 25 









In fact, as soon as she heard about him, a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an impure spirit came and fell at his feet. 



















###### 26 









The woman was a Greek, born in Syrian Phoenicia. She begged Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter. 



















###### 27 









"First let the children eat all they want," he told her, "for it is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to the dogs." 



















###### 28 









"Lord," she replied, "even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs." 



















###### 29 









Then he told her, "For such a reply, you may go; the demon has left your daughter." 



















###### 30 









She went home and found her child lying on the bed, and the demon gone. ## Jesus Heals a Deaf and Mute Man 



















###### 31 









Then Jesus left the vicinity of Tyre and went through Sidon, down to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis.[^h] 



















###### 32 









There some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk, and they begged Jesus to place his hand on him. 



















###### 33 









After he took him aside, away from the crowd, Jesus put his fingers into the man's ears. Then he spit and touched the man's tongue. 



















###### 34 









He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him, _"Ephphatha!"_ (which means "Be opened!"). 



















###### 35 









At this, the man's ears were opened, his tongue was loosened and he began to speak plainly. 



















###### 36 









Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone. But the more he did so, the more they kept talking about it. 



















###### 37 









People were overwhelmed with amazement. "He has done everything well," they said. "He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak."

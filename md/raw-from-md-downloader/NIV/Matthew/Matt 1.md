###### 18 









This is how the birth of Jesus the Messiah came about[^d]: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit. 



















###### 19 









Because Joseph her husband was faithful to the law, and yet[^e] did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly. 



















###### 20 









But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. 



















###### 21 









She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus,[^f] because he will save his people from their sins." 



















###### 22 









All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet: 



















###### 23 









"The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel"[^g] (which means "God with us"). 



















###### 24 









When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife. 



















###### 25 









But he did not consummate their marriage until she gave birth to a son. And he gave him the name Jesus. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

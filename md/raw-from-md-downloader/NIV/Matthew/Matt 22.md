# Matthew 22

***




















###### 1 









Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying: 



















###### 2 









"The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son. 



















###### 3 









He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the banquet to tell them to come, but they refused to come. 



















###### 4 









"Then he sent some more servants and said, 'Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner: My oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.' 



















###### 5 









"But they paid no attention and went off--one to his field, another to his business. 



















###### 6 









The rest seized his servants, mistreated them and killed them. 



















###### 7 









The king was enraged. He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city. 



















###### 8 









"Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding banquet is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come. 



















###### 9 









So go to the street corners and invite to the banquet anyone you find.' 



















###### 10 









So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, the bad as well as the good, and the wedding hall was filled with guests. 



















###### 11 









"But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes. 



















###### 12 









He asked, 'How did you get in here without wedding clothes, friend?' The man was speechless. 



















###### 13 









"Then the king told the attendants, 'Tie him hand and foot, and throw him outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.' 



















###### 14 









"For many are invited, but few are chosen." ## Paying the Imperial Tax to Caesar 



















###### 15 









Then the Pharisees went out and laid plans to trap him in his words. 



















###### 16 









They sent their disciples to him along with the Herodians. "Teacher," they said, "we know that you are a man of integrity and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You aren't swayed by others, because you pay no attention to who they are. 



















###### 17 









Tell us then, what is your opinion? Is it right to pay the imperial tax[^a] to Caesar or not?" 



















###### 18 









But Jesus, knowing their evil intent, said, "You hypocrites, why are you trying to trap me? 



















###### 19 









Show me the coin used for paying the tax." They brought him a denarius, 



















###### 20 









and he asked them, "Whose image is this? And whose inscription?" 



















###### 21 









"Caesar's," they replied. Then he said to them, "So give back to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's." 



















###### 22 









When they heard this, they were amazed. So they left him and went away. ## Marriage at the Resurrection 



















###### 23 









That same day the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question. 



















###### 24 









"Teacher," they said, "Moses told us that if a man dies without having children, his brother must marry the widow and raise up offspring for him. 



















###### 25 









Now there were seven brothers among us. The first one married and died, and since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother. 



















###### 26 









The same thing happened to the second and third brother, right on down to the seventh. 



















###### 27 









Finally, the woman died. 



















###### 28 









Now then, at the resurrection, whose wife will she be of the seven, since all of them were married to her?" 



















###### 29 









Jesus replied, "You are in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God. 



















###### 30 









At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven. 



















###### 31 









But about the resurrection of the dead--have you not read what God said to you, 



















###### 32 









'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'[^b]? He is not the God of the dead but of the living." 



















###### 33 









When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at his teaching. ## The Greatest Commandment 



















###### 34 









Hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, the Pharisees got together. 



















###### 35 









One of them, an expert in the law, tested him with this question: 



















###### 36 









"Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?" 



















###### 37 









Jesus replied: "'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.'[^c] 



















###### 38 









This is the first and greatest commandment. 



















###### 39 









And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'[^d] 



















###### 40 









All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments." ## Whose Son Is the Messiah? 



















###### 41 









While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, 



















###### 42 









"What do you think about the Messiah? Whose son is he?" "The son of David," they replied. 



















###### 43 









He said to them, "How is it then that David, speaking by the Spirit, calls him 'Lord'? For he says, 



















###### 44 









"'The Lord said to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet."'[^e] 



















###### 45 









If then David calls him 'Lord,' how can he be his son?" 



















###### 46 









No one could say a word in reply, and from that day on no one dared to ask him any more questions. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

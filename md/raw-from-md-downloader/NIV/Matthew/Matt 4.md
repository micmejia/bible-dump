###### 5 









Then the devil took him to the holy city and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. 



















###### 6 









"If you are the Son of God," he said, "throw yourself down. For it is written: "'He will command his angels concerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'[^c]"

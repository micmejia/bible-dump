# Micah 2

***




















###### 1 









Woe to those who plan iniquity, to those who plot evil on their beds! At morning's light they carry it out because it is in their power to do it. 



















###### 2 









They covet fields and seize them, and houses, and take them. They defraud people of their homes, they rob them of their inheritance. 



















###### 3 









Therefore, the LORD says: "I am planning disaster against this people, from which you cannot save yourselves. You will no longer walk proudly, for it will be a time of calamity. 



















###### 4 









In that day people will ridicule you; they will taunt you with this mournful song: 'We are utterly ruined; my people's possession is divided up. He takes it from me! He assigns our fields to traitors.'" 



















###### 5 









Therefore you will have no one in the assembly of the LORD to divide the land by lot. ## False Prophets 



















###### 6 









"Do not prophesy," their prophets say. "Do not prophesy about these things; disgrace will not overtake us." 



















###### 7 









You descendants of Jacob, should it be said, "Does the LORD become[^a] impatient? Does he do such things?" "Do not my words do good to the one whose ways are upright? 



















###### 8 









Lately my people have risen up like an enemy. You strip off the rich robe from those who pass by without a care, like men returning from battle. 



















###### 9 









You drive the women of my people from their pleasant homes. You take away my blessing from their children forever. 



















###### 10 









Get up, go away! For this is not your resting place, because it is defiled, it is ruined, beyond all remedy. 



















###### 11 









If a liar and deceiver comes and says, 'I will prophesy for you plenty of wine and beer,' that would be just the prophet for this people! ## Deliverance Promised 



















###### 12 









"I will surely gather all of you, Jacob; I will surely bring together the remnant of Israel. I will bring them together like sheep in a pen, like a flock in its pasture; the place will throng with people. 



















###### 13 









The One who breaks open the way will go up before them; they will break through the gate and go out. Their King will pass through before them, the LORD at their head."

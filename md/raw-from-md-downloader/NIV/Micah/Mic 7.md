# Micah 7

***




















###### 1 









What misery is mine! I am like one who gathers summer fruit at the gleaning of the vineyard; there is no cluster of grapes to eat, none of the early figs that I crave. 



















###### 2 









The faithful have been swept from the land; not one upright person remains. Everyone lies in wait to shed blood; they hunt each other with nets. 



















###### 3 









Both hands are skilled in doing evil; the ruler demands gifts, the judge accepts bribes, the powerful dictate what they desire-- they all conspire together. 



















###### 4 









The best of them is like a brier, the most upright worse than a thorn hedge. The day God visits you has come, the day your watchmen sound the alarm. Now is the time of your confusion. 



















###### 5 









Do not trust a neighbor; put no confidence in a friend. Even with the woman who lies in your embrace guard the words of your lips. 



















###### 6 









For a son dishonors his father, a daughter rises up against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law-- a man's enemies are the members of his own household. 



















###### 7 









But as for me, I watch in hope for the LORD, I wait for God my Savior; my God will hear me. ## Israel Will Rise 



















###### 8 









Do not gloat over me, my enemy! Though I have fallen, I will rise. Though I sit in darkness, the LORD will be my light. 



















###### 9 









Because I have sinned against him, I will bear the LORD's wrath, until he pleads my case and upholds my cause. He will bring me out into the light; I will see his righteousness. 



















###### 10 









Then my enemy will see it and will be covered with shame, she who said to me, "Where is the LORD your God?" My eyes will see her downfall; even now she will be trampled underfoot like mire in the streets. 



















###### 11 









The day for building your walls will come, the day for extending your boundaries. 



















###### 12 









In that day people will come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, even from Egypt to the Euphrates and from sea to sea and from mountain to mountain. 



















###### 13 









The earth will become desolate because of its inhabitants, as the result of their deeds. ## Prayer and Praise 



















###### 14 









Shepherd your people with your staff, the flock of your inheritance, which lives by itself in a forest, in fertile pasturelands.[^a] Let them feed in Bashan and Gilead as in days long ago. 



















###### 15 









"As in the days when you came out of Egypt, I will show them my wonders." 



















###### 16 









Nations will see and be ashamed, deprived of all their power. They will put their hands over their mouths and their ears will become deaf. 



















###### 17 









They will lick dust like a snake, like creatures that crawl on the ground. They will come trembling out of their dens; they will turn in fear to the LORD our God and will be afraid of you. 



















###### 18 









Who is a God like you, who pardons sin and forgives the transgression of the remnant of his inheritance? You do not stay angry forever but delight to show mercy. 



















###### 19 









You will again have compassion on us; you will tread our sins underfoot and hurl all our iniquities into the depths of the sea. 



















###### 20 









You will be faithful to Jacob, and show love to Abraham, as you pledged on oath to our ancestors in days long ago. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

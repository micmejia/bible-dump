###### 1 









A prophecy concerning Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite. ## The LORD's Anger Against Nineveh

The LORD is slow to anger but great in power; the LORD will not leave the guilty unpunished. His way is in the whirlwind and the storm, and clouds are the dust of his feet.

###### 5 









The mountains quake before him and the hills melt away. The earth trembles at his presence, the world and all who live in it. 



















###### 6

###### 7

###### 8

###### 10 









They will be entangled among thorns and drunk from their wine; they will be consumed like dry stubble.[^b] 



















###### 11 









From you, Nineveh, has one come forth who plots evil against the LORD and devises wicked plans. 



















###### 12 









This is what the LORD says: "Although they have allies and are numerous, they will be destroyed and pass away. Although I have afflicted you, Judah, I will afflict you no more. 



















###### 13 









Now I will break their yoke from your neck and tear your shackles away." 



















###### 14 









The LORD has given a command concerning you, Nineveh: "You will have no descendants to bear your name. I will destroy the images and idols that are in the temple of your gods. I will prepare your grave, for you are vile." 



















###### 15 









Look, there on the mountains, the feet of one who brings good news, who proclaims peace! Celebrate your festivals, Judah, and fulfill your vows. No more will the wicked invade you; they will be completely destroyed.[^c] NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

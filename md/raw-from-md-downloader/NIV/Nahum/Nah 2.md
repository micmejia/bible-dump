# Nahum 2

***




















###### 1 









[^a]An attacker advances against you, Nineveh. Guard the fortress, watch the road, brace yourselves, marshal all your strength! 



















###### 2 









The LORD will restore the splendor of Jacob like the splendor of Israel, though destroyers have laid them waste and have ruined their vines. 



















###### 3 









The shields of the soldiers are red; the warriors are clad in scarlet. The metal on the chariots flashes on the day they are made ready; the spears of juniper are brandished.[^b] 



















###### 4 









The chariots storm through the streets, rushing back and forth through the squares. They look like flaming torches; they dart about like lightning. 



















###### 5 









Nineveh summons her picked troops, yet they stumble on their way. They dash to the city wall; the protective shield is put in place. 



















###### 6 









The river gates are thrown open and the palace collapses. 



















###### 7 









It is decreed[^c] that Nineveh be exiled and carried away. Her female slaves moan like doves and beat on their breasts. 



















###### 8 









Nineveh is like a pool whose water is draining away. "Stop! Stop!" they cry, but no one turns back. 



















###### 9 









Plunder the silver! Plunder the gold! The supply is endless, the wealth from all its treasures! 



















###### 10 









She is pillaged, plundered, stripped! Hearts melt, knees give way, bodies tremble, every face grows pale. 



















###### 11 









Where now is the lions' den, the place where they fed their young, where the lion and lioness went, and the cubs, with nothing to fear? 



















###### 12 









The lion killed enough for his cubs and strangled the prey for his mate, filling his lairs with the kill and his dens with the prey. 



















###### 13 









"I am against you," declares the LORD Almighty. "I will burn up your chariots in smoke, and the sword will devour your young lions. I will leave you no prey on the earth. The voices of your messengers will no longer be heard." NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

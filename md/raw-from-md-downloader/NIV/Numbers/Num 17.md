# Numbers 17

***




















###### 1 









[^a]The LORD said to Moses, 



















###### 2 









"Speak to the Israelites and get twelve staffs from them, one from the leader of each of their ancestral tribes. Write the name of each man on his staff. 



















###### 3 









On the staff of Levi write Aaron's name, for there must be one staff for the head of each ancestral tribe. 



















###### 4 









Place them in the tent of meeting in front of the ark of the covenant law, where I meet with you. 



















###### 5 









The staff belonging to the man I choose will sprout, and I will rid myself of this constant grumbling against you by the Israelites." 



















###### 6 









So Moses spoke to the Israelites, and their leaders gave him twelve staffs, one for the leader of each of their ancestral tribes, and Aaron's staff was among them. 



















###### 7 









Moses placed the staffs before the LORD in the tent of the covenant law. 



















###### 8 









The next day Moses entered the tent and saw that Aaron's staff, which represented the tribe of Levi, had not only sprouted but had budded, blossomed and produced almonds. 



















###### 9 









Then Moses brought out all the staffs from the LORD's presence to all the Israelites. They looked at them, and each of the leaders took his own staff. 



















###### 10 









The LORD said to Moses, "Put back Aaron's staff in front of the ark of the covenant law, to be kept as a sign to the rebellious. This will put an end to their grumbling against me, so that they will not die." 



















###### 11 









Moses did just as the LORD commanded him. 



















###### 12 









The Israelites said to Moses, "We will die! We are lost, we are all lost! 



















###### 13 









Anyone who even comes near the tabernacle of the LORD will die. Are we all going to die?" NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

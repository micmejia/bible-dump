# Numbers 23

***




















###### 1 









Balaam said, "Build me seven altars here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me." 



















###### 2 









Balak did as Balaam said, and the two of them offered a bull and a ram on each altar. 



















###### 3 









Then Balaam said to Balak, "Stay here beside your offering while I go aside. Perhaps the LORD will come to meet with me. Whatever he reveals to me I will tell you." Then he went off to a barren height. 



















###### 4 









God met with him, and Balaam said, "I have prepared seven altars, and on each altar I have offered a bull and a ram." 



















###### 5 









The LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth and said, "Go back to Balak and give him this word." 



















###### 6 









So he went back to him and found him standing beside his offering, with all the Moabite officials. 



















###### 7 









Then Balaam spoke his message: "Balak brought me from Aram, the king of Moab from the eastern mountains. 'Come,' he said, 'curse Jacob for me; come, denounce Israel.' 



















###### 8 









How can I curse those whom God has not cursed? How can I denounce those whom the LORD has not denounced? 



















###### 9 









From the rocky peaks I see them, from the heights I view them. I see a people who live apart and do not consider themselves one of the nations. 



















###### 10 









Who can count the dust of Jacob or number even a fourth of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and may my final end be like theirs!" 



















###### 11 









Balak said to Balaam, "What have you done to me? I brought you to curse my enemies, but you have done nothing but bless them!" 



















###### 12 









He answered, "Must I not speak what the LORD puts in my mouth?" ## Balaam's Second Message 



















###### 13 









Then Balak said to him, "Come with me to another place where you can see them; you will not see them all but only the outskirts of their camp. And from there, curse them for me." 



















###### 14 









So he took him to the field of Zophim on the top of Pisgah, and there he built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar. 



















###### 15 









Balaam said to Balak, "Stay here beside your offering while I meet with him over there." 



















###### 16 









The LORD met with Balaam and put a word in his mouth and said, "Go back to Balak and give him this word." 



















###### 17 









So he went to him and found him standing beside his offering, with the Moabite officials. Balak asked him, "What did the LORD say?" 



















###### 18 









Then he spoke his message: "Arise, Balak, and listen; hear me, son of Zippor. 



















###### 19 









God is not human, that he should lie, not a human being, that he should change his mind. Does he speak and then not act? Does he promise and not fulfill? 



















###### 20 









I have received a command to bless; he has blessed, and I cannot change it. 



















###### 21 









"No misfortune is seen in Jacob, no misery observed[^a] in Israel. The LORD their God is with them; the shout of the King is among them. 



















###### 22 









God brought them out of Egypt; they have the strength of a wild ox. 



















###### 23 









There is no divination against[^b] Jacob, no evil omens against[^c] Israel. It will now be said of Jacob and of Israel, 'See what God has done!' 



















###### 24 









The people rise like a lioness; they rouse themselves like a lion that does not rest till it devours its prey and drinks the blood of its victims." 



















###### 25 









Then Balak said to Balaam, "Neither curse them at all nor bless them at all!" 



















###### 26 









Balaam answered, "Did I not tell you I must do whatever the LORD says?" ## Balaam's Third Message 



















###### 27 









Then Balak said to Balaam, "Come, let me take you to another place. Perhaps it will please God to let you curse them for me from there." 



















###### 28 









And Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, overlooking the wasteland. 



















###### 29 









Balaam said, "Build me seven altars here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me." 



















###### 30 









Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

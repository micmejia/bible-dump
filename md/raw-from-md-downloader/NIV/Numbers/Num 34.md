"Command the Israelites and say to them: 'When you enter Canaan, the land that will be allotted to you as an inheritance is to have these boundaries: 



















###### 3 









"'Your southern side will include some of the Desert of Zin along the border of Edom. Your southern boundary will start in the east from the southern end of the Dead Sea, 



















###### 4 









cross south of Scorpion Pass, continue on to Zin and go south of Kadesh Barnea. Then it will go to Hazar Addar and over to Azmon, 



















###### 5 









where it will turn, join the Wadi of Egypt and end at the Mediterranean Sea. 



















###### 6 









"'Your western boundary will be the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. This will be your boundary on the west. 



















###### 7 









"'For your northern boundary, run a line from the Mediterranean Sea to Mount Hor 



















###### 8 









and from Mount Hor to Lebo Hamath. Then the boundary will go to Zedad, 



















###### 9

"'For your eastern boundary, run a line from Hazar Enan to Shepham. 



















###### 11 









The boundary will go down from Shepham to Riblah on the east side of Ain and continue along the slopes east of the Sea of Galilee.[^a] 



















###### 12 









Then the boundary will go down along the Jordan and end at the Dead Sea. "'This will be your land, with its boundaries on every side.'" 



















###### 13 









Moses commanded the Israelites: "Assign this land by lot as an inheritance. The LORD has ordered that it be given to the nine and a half tribes, 



















###### 14 









because the families of the tribe of Reuben, the tribe of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance. 



















###### 15 









These two and a half tribes have received their inheritance east of the Jordan across from Jericho, toward the sunrise." 



















###### 16

###### 17 









"These are the names of the men who are to assign the land for you as an inheritance: Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun.

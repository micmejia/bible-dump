# Philemon 1

***




















###### 1 









Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our dear friend and fellow worker-- 



















###### 2 









also to Apphia our sister and Archippus our fellow soldier--and to the church that meets in your home: 



















###### 3 









Grace and peace to you[^a] from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. ## Thanksgiving and Prayer 



















###### 4 









I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers, 



















###### 5 









because I hear about your love for all his holy people and your faith in the Lord Jesus. 



















###### 6 









I pray that your partnership with us in the faith may be effective in deepening your understanding of every good thing we share for the sake of Christ. 



















###### 7 









Your love has given me great joy and encouragement, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the Lord's people. ## Paul's Plea for Onesimus 



















###### 8 









Therefore, although in Christ I could be bold and order you to do what you ought to do, 



















###### 9 









yet I prefer to appeal to you on the basis of love. It is as none other than Paul--an old man and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus-- 



















###### 10 









that I appeal to you for my son Onesimus,[^b] who became my son while I was in chains. 



















###### 11 









Formerly he was useless to you, but now he has become useful both to you and to me. 



















###### 12 









I am sending him--who is my very heart--back to you. 



















###### 13 









I would have liked to keep him with me so that he could take your place in helping me while I am in chains for the gospel. 



















###### 14 









But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that any favor you do would not seem forced but would be voluntary. 



















###### 15 









Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that you might have him back forever-- 



















###### 16 









no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a dear brother. He is very dear to me but even dearer to you, both as a fellow man and as a brother in the Lord. 



















###### 17 









So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me. 



















###### 18 









If he has done you any wrong or owes you anything, charge it to me. 



















###### 19 









I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand. I will pay it back--not to mention that you owe me your very self. 



















###### 20 









I do wish, brother, that I may have some benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ. 



















###### 21 









Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask. 



















###### 22 









And one thing more: Prepare a guest room for me, because I hope to be restored to you in answer to your prayers. 



















###### 23 









Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings. 



















###### 24 









And so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my fellow workers. 



















###### 25

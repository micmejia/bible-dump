# Philippians 1

***




















###### 1 









Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, To all God's holy people in Christ Jesus at Philippi, together with the overseers and deacons[^a]: 



















###### 2 









Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. ## Thanksgiving and Prayer 



















###### 3 









I thank my God every time I remember you. 



















###### 4 









In all my prayers for all of you, I always pray with joy 



















###### 5 









because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now, 



















###### 6 









being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus. 



















###### 7 









It is right for me to feel this way about all of you, since I have you in my heart and, whether I am in chains or defending and confirming the gospel, all of you share in God's grace with me. 



















###### 8 









God can testify how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus. 



















###### 9 









And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight, 



















###### 10 









so that you may be able to discern what is best and may be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, 



















###### 11 









filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ--to the glory and praise of God. ## Paul's Chains Advance the Gospel 



















###### 12 









Now I want you to know, brothers and sisters,[^b] that what has happened to me has actually served to advance the gospel. 



















###### 13 









As a result, it has become clear throughout the whole palace guard[^c] and to everyone else that I am in chains for Christ. 



















###### 14 









And because of my chains, most of the brothers and sisters have become confident in the Lord and dare all the more to proclaim the gospel without fear. 



















###### 15 









It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of goodwill. 



















###### 16 









The latter do so out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel. 



















###### 17 









The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing that they can stir up trouble for me while I am in chains. 



















###### 18 









But what does it matter? The important thing is that in every way, whether from false motives or true, Christ is preached. And because of this I rejoice. Yes, and I will continue to rejoice, 



















###### 19 









for I know that through your prayers and God's provision of the Spirit of Jesus Christ what has happened to me will turn out for my deliverance.[^d] 



















###### 20 









I eagerly expect and hope that I will in no way be ashamed, but will have sufficient courage so that now as always Christ will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death. 



















###### 21 









For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain. 



















###### 22 









If I am to go on living in the body, this will mean fruitful labor for me. Yet what shall I choose? I do not know! 



















###### 23 









I am torn between the two: I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far; 



















###### 24 









but it is more necessary for you that I remain in the body. 



















###### 25 









Convinced of this, I know that I will remain, and I will continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith, 



















###### 26 









so that through my being with you again your boasting in Christ Jesus will abound on account of me. ## Life Worthy of the Gospel 



















###### 27 









Whatever happens, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence, I will know that you stand firm in the one Spirit,[^e] striving together as one for the faith of the gospel 



















###### 28 









without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you. This is a sign to them that they will be destroyed, but that you will be saved--and that by God. 



















###### 29 









For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for him, 



















###### 30 









since you are going through the same struggle you saw I had, and now hear that I still have. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

# Philippians 2

***




















###### 1 









Therefore if you have any encouragement from being united with Christ, if any comfort from his love, if any common sharing in the Spirit, if any tenderness and compassion, 



















###### 2 









then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being one in spirit and of one mind. 



















###### 3 









Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, 



















###### 4 









not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others. 



















###### 5 









In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus: 



















###### 6 









Who, being in very nature[^a] God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; 



















###### 7 









rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature[^b] of a servant, being made in human likeness. 



















###### 8 









And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death-- even death on a cross! 



















###### 9 









Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name, 



















###### 10 









that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, 



















###### 11 









and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. ## Do Everything Without Grumbling 



















###### 12 









Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always obeyed--not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence--continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling, 



















###### 13 









for it is God who works in you to will and to act in order to fulfill his good purpose. 



















###### 14 









Do everything without grumbling or arguing, 



















###### 15 









so that you may become blameless and pure, "children of God without fault in a warped and crooked generation."[^c] Then you will shine among them like stars in the sky 



















###### 16 









as you hold firmly to the word of life. And then I will be able to boast on the day of Christ that I did not run or labor in vain. 



















###### 17 









But even if I am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and service coming from your faith, I am glad and rejoice with all of you. 



















###### 18 









So you too should be glad and rejoice with me. ## Timothy and Epaphroditus 



















###### 19 









I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered when I receive news about you. 



















###### 20 









I have no one else like him, who will show genuine concern for your welfare. 



















###### 21 









For everyone looks out for their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ. 



















###### 22 









But you know that Timothy has proved himself, because as a son with his father he has served with me in the work of the gospel. 



















###### 23 









I hope, therefore, to send him as soon as I see how things go with me. 



















###### 24 









And I am confident in the Lord that I myself will come soon. 



















###### 25 









But I think it is necessary to send back to you Epaphroditus, my brother, co-worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger, whom you sent to take care of my needs. 



















###### 26 









For he longs for all of you and is distressed because you heard he was ill. 



















###### 27 









Indeed he was ill, and almost died. But God had mercy on him, and not on him only but also on me, to spare me sorrow upon sorrow. 



















###### 28 









Therefore I am all the more eager to send him, so that when you see him again you may be glad and I may have less anxiety. 



















###### 29 









So then, welcome him in the Lord with great joy, and honor people like him, 



















###### 30 









because he almost died for the work of Christ. He risked his life to make up for the help you yourselves could not give me. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

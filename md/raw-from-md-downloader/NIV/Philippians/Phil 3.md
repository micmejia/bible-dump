# Philippians 3

***




















###### 1 









Further, my brothers and sisters, rejoice in the Lord! It is no trouble for me to write the same things to you again, and it is a safeguard for you. 



















###### 2 









Watch out for those dogs, those evildoers, those mutilators of the flesh. 



















###### 3 









For it is we who are the circumcision, we who serve God by his Spirit, who boast in Christ Jesus, and who put no confidence in the flesh-- 



















###### 4 









though I myself have reasons for such confidence. If someone else thinks they have reasons to put confidence in the flesh, I have more: 



















###### 5 









circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; in regard to the law, a Pharisee; 



















###### 6 









as for zeal, persecuting the church; as for righteousness based on the law, faultless. 



















###### 7 









But whatever were gains to me I now consider loss for the sake of Christ. 



















###### 8 









What is more, I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them garbage, that I may gain Christ 



















###### 9 









and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in[^a] Christ--the righteousness that comes from God on the basis of faith. 



















###### 10 









I want to know Christ--yes, to know the power of his resurrection and participation in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, 



















###### 11 









and so, somehow, attaining to the resurrection from the dead. 



















###### 12 









Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already arrived at my goal, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me. 



















###### 13 









Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, 



















###### 14 









I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus. ## Following Paul's Example 



















###### 15 









All of us, then, who are mature should take such a view of things. And if on some point you think differently, that too God will make clear to you. 



















###### 16 









Only let us live up to what we have already attained. 



















###### 17 









Join together in following my example, brothers and sisters, and just as you have us as a model, keep your eyes on those who live as we do. 



















###### 18 









For, as I have often told you before and now tell you again even with tears, many live as enemies of the cross of Christ. 



















###### 19 









Their destiny is destruction, their god is their stomach, and their glory is in their shame. Their mind is set on earthly things. 



















###### 20 









But our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ, 



















###### 21 









who, by the power that enables him to bring everything under his control, will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like his glorious body.

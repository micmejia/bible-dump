# Philippians 4

***




















###### 1 









Therefore, my brothers and sisters, you whom I love and long for, my joy and crown, stand firm in the Lord in this way, dear friends! 



















###### 2 









I plead with Euodia and I plead with Syntyche to be of the same mind in the Lord. 



















###### 3 









Yes, and I ask you, my true companion, help these women since they have contended at my side in the cause of the gospel, along with Clement and the rest of my co-workers, whose names are in the book of life. ## Final Exhortations 



















###### 4 









Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice! 



















###### 5 









Let your gentleness be evident to all. The Lord is near. 



















###### 6 









Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. 



















###### 7 









And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. 



















###### 8 









Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable--if anything is excellent or praiseworthy--think about such things. 



















###### 9 









Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me--put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you. ## Thanks for Their Gifts 



















###### 10 









I rejoiced greatly in the Lord that at last you renewed your concern for me. Indeed, you were concerned, but you had no opportunity to show it. 



















###### 11 









I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances. 



















###### 12 









I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. 



















###### 13 









I can do all this through him who gives me strength. 



















###### 14 









Yet it was good of you to share in my troubles. 



















###### 15 









Moreover, as you Philippians know, in the early days of your acquaintance with the gospel, when I set out from Macedonia, not one church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving, except you only; 



















###### 16 









for even when I was in Thessalonica, you sent me aid more than once when I was in need. 



















###### 17 









Not that I desire your gifts; what I desire is that more be credited to your account. 



















###### 18 









I have received full payment and have more than enough. I am amply supplied, now that I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent. They are a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God. 



















###### 19 









And my God will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus. 



















###### 20 









To our God and Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen. ## Final Greetings 



















###### 21 









Greet all God's people in Christ Jesus. The brothers and sisters who are with me send greetings. 



















###### 22 









All God's people here send you greetings, especially those who belong to Caesar's household. 



















###### 23 









The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.[^a] NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

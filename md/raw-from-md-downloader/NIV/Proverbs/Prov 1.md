***




















###### 1 









The proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel: 



















###### 2 









for gaining wisdom and instruction; for understanding words of insight; 



















###### 3 









for receiving instruction in prudent behavior, doing what is right and just and fair; 



















###### 4 









for giving prudence to those who are simple,[^a] knowledge and discretion to the young-- 



















###### 5 









let the wise listen and add to their learning, and let the discerning get guidance-- 



















###### 6 









for understanding proverbs and parables, the sayings and riddles of the wise.[^b] 



















###### 7 









The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge, but fools[^c] despise wisdom and instruction. ## Prologue: Exhortations to Embrace Wisdom ## Warning Against the Invitation of Sinful Men 



















###### 8 









Listen, my son, to your father's instruction and do not forsake your mother's teaching. 



















###### 9 









They are a garland to grace your head and a chain to adorn your neck. 



















###### 10 









My son, if sinful men entice you, do not give in to them. 



















###### 11 









If they say, "Come along with us; let's lie in wait for innocent blood, let's ambush some harmless soul; 



















###### 12 









let's swallow them alive, like the grave, and whole, like those who go down to the pit; 



















###### 13 









we will get all sorts of valuable things and fill our houses with plunder; 



















###### 14 









cast lots with us; we will all share the loot"-- 



















###### 15 









my son, do not go along with them, do not set foot on their paths; 



















###### 16 









for their feet rush into evil, they are swift to shed blood. 



















###### 17 









How useless to spread a net where every bird can see it! 



















###### 18 









These men lie in wait for their own blood; they ambush only themselves! 



















###### 19 









Such are the paths of all who go after ill-gotten gain; it takes away the life of those who get it. ## Wisdom's Rebuke 



















###### 20 









Out in the open wisdom calls aloud, she raises her voice in the public square; 



















###### 21 









on top of the wall[^d] she cries out, at the city gate she makes her speech: 



















###### 22 









"How long will you who are simple love your simple ways? How long will mockers delight in mockery and fools hate knowledge? 



















###### 23 









Repent at my rebuke! Then I will pour out my thoughts to you, I will make known to you my teachings. 



















###### 24 









But since you refuse to listen when I call and no one pays attention when I stretch out my hand, 



















###### 25 









since you disregard all my advice and do not accept my rebuke, 



















###### 26 









I in turn will laugh when disaster strikes you; I will mock when calamity overtakes you-- 



















###### 27 









when calamity overtakes you like a storm, when disaster sweeps over you like a whirlwind, when distress and trouble overwhelm you. 



















###### 28 









"Then they will call to me but I will not answer; they will look for me but will not find me, 



















###### 29 









since they hated knowledge and did not choose to fear the LORD. 



















###### 30 









Since they would not accept my advice and spurned my rebuke, 



















###### 31 









they will eat the fruit of their ways and be filled with the fruit of their schemes. 



















###### 32 









For the waywardness of the simple will kill them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them; 



















###### 33 









but whoever listens to me will live in safety and be at ease, without fear of harm." NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

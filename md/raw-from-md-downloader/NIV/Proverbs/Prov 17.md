# Proverbs 17

***




















###### 1 









Better a dry crust with peace and quiet than a house full of feasting, with strife. 



















###### 2 









A prudent servant will rule over a disgraceful son and will share the inheritance as one of the family. 



















###### 3 









The crucible for silver and the furnace for gold, but the LORD tests the heart. 



















###### 4 









A wicked person listens to deceitful lips; a liar pays attention to a destructive tongue. 



















###### 5 









Whoever mocks the poor shows contempt for their Maker; whoever gloats over disaster will not go unpunished. 



















###### 6 









Children's children are a crown to the aged, and parents are the pride of their children. 



















###### 7 









Eloquent lips are unsuited to a godless fool-- how much worse lying lips to a ruler! 



















###### 8 









A bribe is seen as a charm by the one who gives it; they think success will come at every turn. 



















###### 9 









Whoever would foster love covers over an offense, but whoever repeats the matter separates close friends. 



















###### 10 









A rebuke impresses a discerning person more than a hundred lashes a fool. 



















###### 11 









Evildoers foster rebellion against God; the messenger of death will be sent against them. 



















###### 12 









Better to meet a bear robbed of her cubs than a fool bent on folly. 



















###### 13 









Evil will never leave the house of one who pays back evil for good. 



















###### 14 









Starting a quarrel is like breaching a dam; so drop the matter before a dispute breaks out. 



















###### 15 









Acquitting the guilty and condemning the innocent-- the LORD detests them both. 



















###### 16 









Why should fools have money in hand to buy wisdom, when they are not able to understand it? 



















###### 17 









A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for a time of adversity. 



















###### 18 









One who has no sense shakes hands in pledge and puts up security for a neighbor. 



















###### 19 









Whoever loves a quarrel loves sin; whoever builds a high gate invites destruction. 



















###### 20 









One whose heart is corrupt does not prosper; one whose tongue is perverse falls into trouble. 



















###### 21 









To have a fool for a child brings grief; there is no joy for the parent of a godless fool. 



















###### 22 









A cheerful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones. 



















###### 23 









The wicked accept bribes in secret to pervert the course of justice. 



















###### 24 









A discerning person keeps wisdom in view, but a fool's eyes wander to the ends of the earth. 



















###### 25 









A foolish son brings grief to his father and bitterness to the mother who bore him. 



















###### 26 









If imposing a fine on the innocent is not good, surely to flog honest officials is not right. 



















###### 27 









The one who has knowledge uses words with restraint, and whoever has understanding is even-tempered. 



















###### 28 









Even fools are thought wise if they keep silent, and discerning if they hold their tongues. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

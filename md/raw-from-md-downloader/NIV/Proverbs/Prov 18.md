# Proverbs 18

***




















###### 1 









An unfriendly person pursues selfish ends and against all sound judgment starts quarrels. 



















###### 2 









Fools find no pleasure in understanding but delight in airing their own opinions. 



















###### 3 









When wickedness comes, so does contempt, and with shame comes reproach. 



















###### 4 









The words of the mouth are deep waters, but the fountain of wisdom is a rushing stream. 



















###### 5 









It is not good to be partial to the wicked and so deprive the innocent of justice. 



















###### 6 









The lips of fools bring them strife, and their mouths invite a beating. 



















###### 7 









The mouths of fools are their undoing, and their lips are a snare to their very lives. 



















###### 8 









The words of a gossip are like choice morsels; they go down to the inmost parts. 



















###### 9 









One who is slack in his work is brother to one who destroys. 



















###### 10 









The name of the LORD is a fortified tower; the righteous run to it and are safe. 



















###### 11 









The wealth of the rich is their fortified city; they imagine it a wall too high to scale. 



















###### 12 









Before a downfall the heart is haughty, but humility comes before honor. 



















###### 13 









To answer before listening-- that is folly and shame. 



















###### 14 









The human spirit can endure in sickness, but a crushed spirit who can bear? 



















###### 15 









The heart of the discerning acquires knowledge, for the ears of the wise seek it out. 



















###### 16 









A gift opens the way and ushers the giver into the presence of the great. 



















###### 17 









In a lawsuit the first to speak seems right, until someone comes forward and cross-examines. 



















###### 18 









Casting the lot settles disputes and keeps strong opponents apart. 



















###### 19 









A brother wronged is more unyielding than a fortified city; disputes are like the barred gates of a citadel. 



















###### 20 









From the fruit of their mouth a person's stomach is filled; with the harvest of their lips they are satisfied. 



















###### 21 









The tongue has the power of life and death, and those who love it will eat its fruit. 



















###### 22 









He who finds a wife finds what is good and receives favor from the LORD. 



















###### 23 









The poor plead for mercy, but the rich answer harshly. 



















###### 24 









One who has unreliable friends soon comes to ruin, but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

# Proverbs 19

***




















###### 1 









Better the poor whose walk is blameless than a fool whose lips are perverse. 



















###### 2 









Desire without knowledge is not good-- how much more will hasty feet miss the way! 



















###### 3 









A person's own folly leads to their ruin, yet their heart rages against the LORD. 



















###### 4 









Wealth attracts many friends, but even the closest friend of the poor person deserts them. 



















###### 5 









A false witness will not go unpunished, and whoever pours out lies will not go free. 



















###### 6 









Many curry favor with a ruler, and everyone is the friend of one who gives gifts. 



















###### 7 









The poor are shunned by all their relatives-- how much more do their friends avoid them! Though the poor pursue them with pleading, they are nowhere to be found.[^a] 



















###### 8 









The one who gets wisdom loves life; the one who cherishes understanding will soon prosper. 



















###### 9 









A false witness will not go unpunished, and whoever pours out lies will perish. 



















###### 10 









It is not fitting for a fool to live in luxury-- how much worse for a slave to rule over princes! 



















###### 11 









A person's wisdom yields patience; it is to one's glory to overlook an offense. 



















###### 12 









A king's rage is like the roar of a lion, but his favor is like dew on the grass. 



















###### 13 









A foolish child is a father's ruin, and a quarrelsome wife is like the constant dripping of a leaky roof. 



















###### 14 









Houses and wealth are inherited from parents, but a prudent wife is from the LORD. 



















###### 15 









Laziness brings on deep sleep, and the shiftless go hungry. 



















###### 16 









Whoever keeps commandments keeps their life, but whoever shows contempt for their ways will die. 



















###### 17 









Whoever is kind to the poor lends to the LORD, and he will reward them for what they have done. 



















###### 18 









Discipline your children, for in that there is hope; do not be a willing party to their death. 



















###### 19 









A hot-tempered person must pay the penalty; rescue them, and you will have to do it again. 



















###### 20 









Listen to advice and accept discipline, and at the end you will be counted among the wise. 



















###### 21 









Many are the plans in a person's heart, but it is the LORD's purpose that prevails. 



















###### 22 









What a person desires is unfailing love[^b]; better to be poor than a liar. 



















###### 23 









The fear of the LORD leads to life; then one rests content, untouched by trouble. 



















###### 24 









A sluggard buries his hand in the dish; he will not even bring it back to his mouth! 



















###### 25 









Flog a mocker, and the simple will learn prudence; rebuke the discerning, and they will gain knowledge. 



















###### 26 









Whoever robs their father and drives out their mother is a child who brings shame and disgrace. 



















###### 27 









Stop listening to instruction, my son, and you will stray from the words of knowledge. 



















###### 28 









A corrupt witness mocks at justice, and the mouth of the wicked gulps down evil. 



















###### 29 









Penalties are prepared for mockers, and beatings for the backs of fools. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

# Proverbs 2

***




















###### 1 









My son, if you accept my words and store up my commands within you, 



















###### 2 









turning your ear to wisdom and applying your heart to understanding-- 



















###### 3 









indeed, if you call out for insight and cry aloud for understanding, 



















###### 4 









and if you look for it as for silver and search for it as for hidden treasure, 



















###### 5 









then you will understand the fear of the LORD and find the knowledge of God. 



















###### 6 









For the LORD gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding. 



















###### 7 









He holds success in store for the upright, he is a shield to those whose walk is blameless, 



















###### 8 









for he guards the course of the just and protects the way of his faithful ones. 



















###### 9 









Then you will understand what is right and just and fair--every good path. 



















###### 10 









For wisdom will enter your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul. 



















###### 11 









Discretion will protect you, and understanding will guard you. 



















###### 12 









Wisdom will save you from the ways of wicked men, from men whose words are perverse, 



















###### 13 









who have left the straight paths to walk in dark ways, 



















###### 14 









who delight in doing wrong and rejoice in the perverseness of evil, 



















###### 15 









whose paths are crooked and who are devious in their ways. 



















###### 16 









Wisdom will save you also from the adulterous woman, from the wayward woman with her seductive words, 



















###### 17 









who has left the partner of her youth and ignored the covenant she made before God.[^a] 



















###### 18 









Surely her house leads down to death and her paths to the spirits of the dead. 



















###### 19 









None who go to her return or attain the paths of life. 



















###### 20 









Thus you will walk in the ways of the good and keep to the paths of the righteous. 



















###### 21 









For the upright will live in the land, and the blameless will remain in it; 



















###### 22 









but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the unfaithful will be torn from it. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

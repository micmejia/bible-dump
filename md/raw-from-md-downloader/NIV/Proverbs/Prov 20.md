# Proverbs 20

***




















###### 1 









Wine is a mocker and beer a brawler; whoever is led astray by them is not wise. 



















###### 2 









A king's wrath strikes terror like the roar of a lion; those who anger him forfeit their lives. 



















###### 3 









It is to one's honor to avoid strife, but every fool is quick to quarrel. 



















###### 4 









Sluggards do not plow in season; so at harvest time they look but find nothing. 



















###### 5 









The purposes of a person's heart are deep waters, but one who has insight draws them out. 



















###### 6 









Many claim to have unfailing love, but a faithful person who can find? 



















###### 7 









The righteous lead blameless lives; blessed are their children after them. 



















###### 8 









When a king sits on his throne to judge, he winnows out all evil with his eyes. 



















###### 9 









Who can say, "I have kept my heart pure; I am clean and without sin"? 



















###### 10 









Differing weights and differing measures-- the LORD detests them both. 



















###### 11 









Even small children are known by their actions, so is their conduct really pure and upright? 



















###### 12 









Ears that hear and eyes that see-- the LORD has made them both. 



















###### 13 









Do not love sleep or you will grow poor; stay awake and you will have food to spare. 



















###### 14 









"It's no good, it's no good!" says the buyer-- then goes off and boasts about the purchase. 



















###### 15 









Gold there is, and rubies in abundance, but lips that speak knowledge are a rare jewel. 



















###### 16 









Take the garment of one who puts up security for a stranger; hold it in pledge if it is done for an outsider. 



















###### 17 









Food gained by fraud tastes sweet, but one ends up with a mouth full of gravel. 



















###### 18 









Plans are established by seeking advice; so if you wage war, obtain guidance. 



















###### 19 









A gossip betrays a confidence; so avoid anyone who talks too much. 



















###### 20 









If someone curses their father or mother, their lamp will be snuffed out in pitch darkness. 



















###### 21 









An inheritance claimed too soon will not be blessed at the end. 



















###### 22 









Do not say, "I'll pay you back for this wrong!" Wait for the LORD, and he will avenge you. 



















###### 23 









The LORD detests differing weights, and dishonest scales do not please him. 



















###### 24 









A person's steps are directed by the LORD. How then can anyone understand their own way? 



















###### 25 









It is a trap to dedicate something rashly and only later to consider one's vows. 



















###### 26 









A wise king winnows out the wicked; he drives the threshing wheel over them. 



















###### 27 









The human spirit is[^a] the lamp of the LORD that sheds light on one's inmost being. 



















###### 28 









Love and faithfulness keep a king safe; through love his throne is made secure. 



















###### 29 









The glory of young men is their strength, gray hair the splendor of the old. 



















###### 30 









Blows and wounds scrub away evil, and beatings purge the inmost being. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

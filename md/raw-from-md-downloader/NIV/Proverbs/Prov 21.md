# Proverbs 21

***




















###### 1 









In the LORD's hand the king's heart is a stream of water that he channels toward all who please him. 



















###### 2 









A person may think their own ways are right, but the LORD weighs the heart. 



















###### 3 









To do what is right and just is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice. 



















###### 4 









Haughty eyes and a proud heart-- the unplowed field of the wicked--produce sin. 



















###### 5 









The plans of the diligent lead to profit as surely as haste leads to poverty. 



















###### 6 









A fortune made by a lying tongue is a fleeting vapor and a deadly snare.[^a] 



















###### 7 









The violence of the wicked will drag them away, for they refuse to do what is right. 



















###### 8 









The way of the guilty is devious, but the conduct of the innocent is upright. 



















###### 9 









Better to live on a corner of the roof than share a house with a quarrelsome wife. 



















###### 10 









The wicked crave evil; their neighbors get no mercy from them. 



















###### 11 









When a mocker is punished, the simple gain wisdom; by paying attention to the wise they get knowledge. 



















###### 12 









The Righteous One[^b] takes note of the house of the wicked and brings the wicked to ruin. 



















###### 13 









Whoever shuts their ears to the cry of the poor will also cry out and not be answered. 



















###### 14 









A gift given in secret soothes anger, and a bribe concealed in the cloak pacifies great wrath. 



















###### 15 









When justice is done, it brings joy to the righteous but terror to evildoers. 



















###### 16 









Whoever strays from the path of prudence comes to rest in the company of the dead. 



















###### 17 









Whoever loves pleasure will become poor; whoever loves wine and olive oil will never be rich. 



















###### 18 









The wicked become a ransom for the righteous, and the unfaithful for the upright. 



















###### 19 









Better to live in a desert than with a quarrelsome and nagging wife. 



















###### 20 









The wise store up choice food and olive oil, but fools gulp theirs down. 



















###### 21 









Whoever pursues righteousness and love finds life, prosperity[^c] and honor. 



















###### 22 









One who is wise can go up against the city of the mighty and pull down the stronghold in which they trust. 



















###### 23 









Those who guard their mouths and their tongues keep themselves from calamity. 



















###### 24 









The proud and arrogant person--"Mocker" is his name-- behaves with insolent fury. 



















###### 25 









The craving of a sluggard will be the death of him, because his hands refuse to work. 



















###### 26 









All day long he craves for more, but the righteous give without sparing. 



















###### 27 









The sacrifice of the wicked is detestable-- how much more so when brought with evil intent! 



















###### 28 









A false witness will perish, but a careful listener will testify successfully. 



















###### 29 









The wicked put up a bold front, but the upright give thought to their ways. 



















###### 30 









There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan that can succeed against the LORD. 



















###### 31 









The horse is made ready for the day of battle, but victory rests with the LORD. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

# Proverbs 22

***




















###### 1 









A good name is more desirable than great riches; to be esteemed is better than silver or gold. 



















###### 2 









Rich and poor have this in common: The LORD is the Maker of them all. 



















###### 3 









The prudent see danger and take refuge, but the simple keep going and pay the penalty. 



















###### 4 









Humility is the fear of the LORD; its wages are riches and honor and life. 



















###### 5 









In the paths of the wicked are snares and pitfalls, but those who would preserve their life stay far from them. 



















###### 6 









Start children off on the way they should go, and even when they are old they will not turn from it. 



















###### 7 









The rich rule over the poor, and the borrower is slave to the lender. 



















###### 8 









Whoever sows injustice reaps calamity, and the rod they wield in fury will be broken. 



















###### 9 









The generous will themselves be blessed, for they share their food with the poor. 



















###### 10 









Drive out the mocker, and out goes strife; quarrels and insults are ended. 



















###### 11 









One who loves a pure heart and who speaks with grace will have the king for a friend. 



















###### 12 









The eyes of the LORD keep watch over knowledge, but he frustrates the words of the unfaithful. 



















###### 13 









The sluggard says, "There's a lion outside! I'll be killed in the public square!" 



















###### 14 









The mouth of an adulterous woman is a deep pit; a man who is under the LORD's wrath falls into it. 



















###### 15 









Folly is bound up in the heart of a child, but the rod of discipline will drive it far away. 



















###### 16 









One who oppresses the poor to increase his wealth and one who gives gifts to the rich--both come to poverty. ## Thirty Sayings of the Wise 



















###### 17 









Pay attention and turn your ear to the sayings of the wise; apply your heart to what I teach, 



















###### 18 









for it is pleasing when you keep them in your heart and have all of them ready on your lips. 



















###### 19 









So that your trust may be in the LORD, I teach you today, even you. 



















###### 20 









Have I not written thirty sayings for you, sayings of counsel and knowledge, 



















###### 21 









teaching you to be honest and to speak the truth, so that you bring back truthful reports to those you serve? 



















###### 22 









Do not exploit the poor because they are poor and do not crush the needy in court, 



















###### 23 









for the LORD will take up their case and will exact life for life. 



















###### 24 









Do not make friends with a hot-tempered person, do not associate with one easily angered, 



















###### 25 









or you may learn their ways and get yourself ensnared. 



















###### 26 









Do not be one who shakes hands in pledge or puts up security for debts; 



















###### 27 









if you lack the means to pay, your very bed will be snatched from under you. 



















###### 28 









Do not move an ancient boundary stone set up by your ancestors. 



















###### 29 









Do you see someone skilled in their work? They will serve before kings; they will not serve before officials of low rank. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

# Proverbs 23

***




















###### 1 









When you sit to dine with a ruler, note well what[^a] is before you, 



















###### 2 









and put a knife to your throat if you are given to gluttony. 



















###### 3 









Do not crave his delicacies, for that food is deceptive. 



















###### 4 









Do not wear yourself out to get rich; do not trust your own cleverness. 



















###### 5 









Cast but a glance at riches, and they are gone, for they will surely sprout wings and fly off to the sky like an eagle. 



















###### 6 









Do not eat the food of a begrudging host, do not crave his delicacies; 



















###### 7 









for he is the kind of person who is always thinking about the cost.[^b] "Eat and drink," he says to you, but his heart is not with you. 



















###### 8 









You will vomit up the little you have eaten and will have wasted your compliments. 



















###### 9 









Do not speak to fools, for they will scorn your prudent words. 



















###### 10 









Do not move an ancient boundary stone or encroach on the fields of the fatherless, 



















###### 11 









for their Defender is strong; he will take up their case against you. 



















###### 12 









Apply your heart to instruction and your ears to words of knowledge. 



















###### 13 









Do not withhold discipline from a child; if you punish them with the rod, they will not die. 



















###### 14 









Punish them with the rod and save them from death. 



















###### 15 









My son, if your heart is wise, then my heart will be glad indeed; 



















###### 16 









my inmost being will rejoice when your lips speak what is right. 



















###### 17 









Do not let your heart envy sinners, but always be zealous for the fear of the LORD. 



















###### 18 









There is surely a future hope for you, and your hope will not be cut off. 



















###### 19 









Listen, my son, and be wise, and set your heart on the right path: 



















###### 20 









Do not join those who drink too much wine or gorge themselves on meat, 



















###### 21 









for drunkards and gluttons become poor, and drowsiness clothes them in rags. 



















###### 22 









Listen to your father, who gave you life, and do not despise your mother when she is old. 



















###### 23 









Buy the truth and do not sell it-- wisdom, instruction and insight as well. 



















###### 24 









The father of a righteous child has great joy; a man who fathers a wise son rejoices in him. 



















###### 25 









May your father and mother rejoice; may she who gave you birth be joyful! 



















###### 26 









My son, give me your heart and let your eyes delight in my ways, 



















###### 27 









for an adulterous woman is a deep pit, and a wayward wife is a narrow well. 



















###### 28 









Like a bandit she lies in wait and multiplies the unfaithful among men. 



















###### 29 









Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has strife? Who has complaints? Who has needless bruises? Who has bloodshot eyes? 



















###### 30 









Those who linger over wine, who go to sample bowls of mixed wine. 



















###### 31 









Do not gaze at wine when it is red, when it sparkles in the cup, when it goes down smoothly! 



















###### 32 









In the end it bites like a snake and poisons like a viper. 



















###### 33 









Your eyes will see strange sights, and your mind will imagine confusing things. 



















###### 34 









You will be like one sleeping on the high seas, lying on top of the rigging. 



















###### 35 









"They hit me," you will say, "but I'm not hurt! They beat me, but I don't feel it! When will I wake up so I can find another drink?"

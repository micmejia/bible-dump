# Proverbs 25

***




















###### 1 









These are more proverbs of Solomon, compiled by the men of Hezekiah king of Judah: 



















###### 2 









It is the glory of God to conceal a matter; to search out a matter is the glory of kings. 



















###### 3 









As the heavens are high and the earth is deep, so the hearts of kings are unsearchable. 



















###### 4 









Remove the dross from the silver, and a silversmith can produce a vessel; 



















###### 5 









remove wicked officials from the king's presence, and his throne will be established through righteousness. 



















###### 6 









Do not exalt yourself in the king's presence, and do not claim a place among his great men; 



















###### 7 









it is better for him to say to you, "Come up here," than for him to humiliate you before his nobles. What you have seen with your eyes 



















###### 8 









do not bring[^a] hastily to court, for what will you do in the end if your neighbor puts you to shame? 



















###### 9 









If you take your neighbor to court, do not betray another's confidence, 



















###### 10 









or the one who hears it may shame you and the charge against you will stand. 



















###### 11 









Like apples[^b] of gold in settings of silver is a ruling rightly given. 



















###### 12 









Like an earring of gold or an ornament of fine gold is the rebuke of a wise judge to a listening ear. 



















###### 13 









Like a snow-cooled drink at harvest time is a trustworthy messenger to the one who sends him; he refreshes the spirit of his master. 



















###### 14 









Like clouds and wind without rain is one who boasts of gifts never given. 



















###### 15 









Through patience a ruler can be persuaded, and a gentle tongue can break a bone. 



















###### 16 









If you find honey, eat just enough-- too much of it, and you will vomit. 



















###### 17 









Seldom set foot in your neighbor's house-- too much of you, and they will hate you. 



















###### 18 









Like a club or a sword or a sharp arrow is one who gives false testimony against a neighbor. 



















###### 19 









Like a broken tooth or a lame foot is reliance on the unfaithful in a time of trouble. 



















###### 20 









Like one who takes away a garment on a cold day, or like vinegar poured on a wound, is one who sings songs to a heavy heart. 



















###### 21 









If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat; if he is thirsty, give him water to drink. 



















###### 22 









In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head, and the LORD will reward you. 



















###### 23 









Like a north wind that brings unexpected rain is a sly tongue--which provokes a horrified look. 



















###### 24 









Better to live on a corner of the roof than share a house with a quarrelsome wife. 



















###### 25 









Like cold water to a weary soul is good news from a distant land. 



















###### 26 









Like a muddied spring or a polluted well are the righteous who give way to the wicked. 



















###### 27 









It is not good to eat too much honey, nor is it honorable to search out matters that are too deep. 



















###### 28 









Like a city whose walls are broken through is a person who lacks self-control. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

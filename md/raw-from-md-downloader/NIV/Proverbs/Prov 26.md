# Proverbs 26

***




















###### 1 









Like snow in summer or rain in harvest, honor is not fitting for a fool. 



















###### 2 









Like a fluttering sparrow or a darting swallow, an undeserved curse does not come to rest. 



















###### 3 









A whip for the horse, a bridle for the donkey, and a rod for the backs of fools! 



















###### 4 









Do not answer a fool according to his folly, or you yourself will be just like him. 



















###### 5 









Answer a fool according to his folly, or he will be wise in his own eyes. 



















###### 6 









Sending a message by the hands of a fool is like cutting off one's feet or drinking poison. 



















###### 7 









Like the useless legs of one who is lame is a proverb in the mouth of a fool. 



















###### 8 









Like tying a stone in a sling is the giving of honor to a fool. 



















###### 9 









Like a thornbush in a drunkard's hand is a proverb in the mouth of a fool. 



















###### 10 









Like an archer who wounds at random is one who hires a fool or any passer-by. 



















###### 11 









As a dog returns to its vomit, so fools repeat their folly. 



















###### 12 









Do you see a person wise in their own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than for them. 



















###### 13 









A sluggard says, "There's a lion in the road, a fierce lion roaming the streets!" 



















###### 14 









As a door turns on its hinges, so a sluggard turns on his bed. 



















###### 15 









A sluggard buries his hand in the dish; he is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth. 



















###### 16 









A sluggard is wiser in his own eyes than seven people who answer discreetly. 



















###### 17 









Like one who grabs a stray dog by the ears is someone who rushes into a quarrel not their own. 



















###### 18 









Like a maniac shooting flaming arrows of death 



















###### 19 









is one who deceives their neighbor and says, "I was only joking!" 



















###### 20 









Without wood a fire goes out; without a gossip a quarrel dies down. 



















###### 21 









As charcoal to embers and as wood to fire, so is a quarrelsome person for kindling strife. 



















###### 22 









The words of a gossip are like choice morsels; they go down to the inmost parts. 



















###### 23 









Like a coating of silver dross on earthenware are fervent[^a] lips with an evil heart. 



















###### 24 









Enemies disguise themselves with their lips, but in their hearts they harbor deceit. 



















###### 25 









Though their speech is charming, do not believe them, for seven abominations fill their hearts. 



















###### 26 









Their malice may be concealed by deception, but their wickedness will be exposed in the assembly. 



















###### 27 









Whoever digs a pit will fall into it; if someone rolls a stone, it will roll back on them. 



















###### 28

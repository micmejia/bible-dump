# Proverbs 27

***




















###### 1 









Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring. 



















###### 2 









Let someone else praise you, and not your own mouth; an outsider, and not your own lips. 



















###### 3 









Stone is heavy and sand a burden, but a fool's provocation is heavier than both. 



















###### 4 









Anger is cruel and fury overwhelming, but who can stand before jealousy? 



















###### 5 









Better is open rebuke than hidden love. 



















###### 6 









Wounds from a friend can be trusted, but an enemy multiplies kisses. 



















###### 7 









One who is full loathes honey from the comb, but to the hungry even what is bitter tastes sweet. 



















###### 8 









Like a bird that flees its nest is anyone who flees from home. 



















###### 9 









Perfume and incense bring joy to the heart, and the pleasantness of a friend springs from their heartfelt advice. 



















###### 10 









Do not forsake your friend or a friend of your family, and do not go to your relative's house when disaster strikes you-- better a neighbor nearby than a relative far away. 



















###### 11 









Be wise, my son, and bring joy to my heart; then I can answer anyone who treats me with contempt. 



















###### 12 









The prudent see danger and take refuge, but the simple keep going and pay the penalty. 



















###### 13 









Take the garment of one who puts up security for a stranger; hold it in pledge if it is done for an outsider. 



















###### 14 









If anyone loudly blesses their neighbor early in the morning, it will be taken as a curse. 



















###### 15 









A quarrelsome wife is like the dripping of a leaky roof in a rainstorm; 



















###### 16 









restraining her is like restraining the wind or grasping oil with the hand. 



















###### 17 









As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another. 



















###### 18 









The one who guards a fig tree will eat its fruit, and whoever protects their master will be honored. 



















###### 19 









As water reflects the face, so one's life reflects the heart.[^a] 



















###### 20 









Death and Destruction[^b] are never satisfied, and neither are human eyes. 



















###### 21 









The crucible for silver and the furnace for gold, but people are tested by their praise. 



















###### 22 









Though you grind a fool in a mortar, grinding them like grain with a pestle, you will not remove their folly from them. 



















###### 23 









Be sure you know the condition of your flocks, give careful attention to your herds; 



















###### 24 









for riches do not endure forever, and a crown is not secure for all generations. 



















###### 25 









When the hay is removed and new growth appears and the grass from the hills is gathered in, 



















###### 26 









the lambs will provide you with clothing, and the goats with the price of a field. 



















###### 27 









You will have plenty of goats' milk to feed your family and to nourish your female servants. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

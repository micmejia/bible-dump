# Proverbs 28

***




















###### 1 









The wicked flee though no one pursues, but the righteous are as bold as a lion. 



















###### 2 









When a country is rebellious, it has many rulers, but a ruler with discernment and knowledge maintains order. 



















###### 3 









A ruler[^a] who oppresses the poor is like a driving rain that leaves no crops. 



















###### 4 









Those who forsake instruction praise the wicked, but those who heed it resist them. 



















###### 5 









Evildoers do not understand what is right, but those who seek the LORD understand it fully. 



















###### 6 









Better the poor whose walk is blameless than the rich whose ways are perverse. 



















###### 7 









A discerning son heeds instruction, but a companion of gluttons disgraces his father. 



















###### 8 









Whoever increases wealth by taking interest or profit from the poor amasses it for another, who will be kind to the poor. 



















###### 9 









If anyone turns a deaf ear to my instruction, even their prayers are detestable. 



















###### 10 









Whoever leads the upright along an evil path will fall into their own trap, but the blameless will receive a good inheritance. 



















###### 11 









The rich are wise in their own eyes; one who is poor and discerning sees how deluded they are. 



















###### 12 









When the righteous triumph, there is great elation; but when the wicked rise to power, people go into hiding. 



















###### 13 









Whoever conceals their sins does not prosper, but the one who confesses and renounces them finds mercy. 



















###### 14 









Blessed is the one who always trembles before God, but whoever hardens their heart falls into trouble. 



















###### 15 









Like a roaring lion or a charging bear is a wicked ruler over a helpless people. 



















###### 16 









A tyrannical ruler practices extortion, but one who hates ill-gotten gain will enjoy a long reign. 



















###### 17 









Anyone tormented by the guilt of murder will seek refuge in the grave; let no one hold them back. 



















###### 18 









The one whose walk is blameless is kept safe, but the one whose ways are perverse will fall into the pit.[^b] 



















###### 19 









Those who work their land will have abundant food, but those who chase fantasies will have their fill of poverty. 



















###### 20 









A faithful person will be richly blessed, but one eager to get rich will not go unpunished. 



















###### 21 









To show partiality is not good-- yet a person will do wrong for a piece of bread. 



















###### 22 









The stingy are eager to get rich and are unaware that poverty awaits them. 



















###### 23 









Whoever rebukes a person will in the end gain favor rather than one who has a flattering tongue. 



















###### 24 









Whoever robs their father or mother and says, "It's not wrong," is partner to one who destroys. 



















###### 25 









The greedy stir up conflict, but those who trust in the LORD will prosper. 



















###### 26 









Those who trust in themselves are fools, but those who walk in wisdom are kept safe. 



















###### 27 









Those who give to the poor will lack nothing, but those who close their eyes to them receive many curses. 



















###### 28

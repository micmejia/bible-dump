# Proverbs 3

***




















###### 1 









My son, do not forget my teaching, but keep my commands in your heart, 



















###### 2 









for they will prolong your life many years and bring you peace and prosperity. 



















###### 3 









Let love and faithfulness never leave you; bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart. 



















###### 4 









Then you will win favor and a good name in the sight of God and man. 



















###### 5 









Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; 



















###### 6 









in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.[^a] 



















###### 7 









Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear the LORD and shun evil. 



















###### 8 









This will bring health to your body and nourishment to your bones. 



















###### 9 









Honor the LORD with your wealth, with the firstfruits of all your crops; 



















###### 10 









then your barns will be filled to overflowing, and your vats will brim over with new wine. 



















###### 11 









My son, do not despise the LORD's discipline, and do not resent his rebuke, 



















###### 12 









because the LORD disciplines those he loves, as a father the son he delights in.[^b] 



















###### 13 









Blessed are those who find wisdom, those who gain understanding, 



















###### 14 









for she is more profitable than silver and yields better returns than gold. 



















###### 15 









She is more precious than rubies; nothing you desire can compare with her. 



















###### 16 









Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor. 



















###### 17 









Her ways are pleasant ways, and all her paths are peace. 



















###### 18 









She is a tree of life to those who take hold of her; those who hold her fast will be blessed. 



















###### 19 









By wisdom the LORD laid the earth's foundations, by understanding he set the heavens in place; 



















###### 20 









by his knowledge the watery depths were divided, and the clouds let drop the dew. 



















###### 21 









My son, do not let wisdom and understanding out of your sight, preserve sound judgment and discretion; 



















###### 22 









they will be life for you, an ornament to grace your neck. 



















###### 23 









Then you will go on your way in safety, and your foot will not stumble. 



















###### 24 









When you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet. 



















###### 25 









Have no fear of sudden disaster or of the ruin that overtakes the wicked, 



















###### 26 









for the LORD will be at your side and will keep your foot from being snared. 



















###### 27 









Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in your power to act. 



















###### 28 









Do not say to your neighbor, "Come back tomorrow and I'll give it to you"-- when you already have it with you. 



















###### 29 









Do not plot harm against your neighbor, who lives trustfully near you. 



















###### 30 









Do not accuse anyone for no reason-- when they have done you no harm. 



















###### 31 









Do not envy the violent or choose any of their ways. 



















###### 32 









For the LORD detests the perverse but takes the upright into his confidence. 



















###### 33 









The LORD's curse is on the house of the wicked, but he blesses the home of the righteous. 



















###### 34 









He mocks proud mockers but shows favor to the humble and oppressed. 



















###### 35

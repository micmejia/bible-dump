# Proverbs 30

***




















###### 1 









The sayings of Agur son of Jakeh--an inspired utterance. This man's utterance to Ithiel: "I am weary, God, but I can prevail.[^a] 



















###### 2 









Surely I am only a brute, not a man; I do not have human understanding. 



















###### 3 









I have not learned wisdom, nor have I attained to the knowledge of the Holy One. 



















###### 4 









Who has gone up to heaven and come down? Whose hands have gathered up the wind? Who has wrapped up the waters in a cloak? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is his name, and what is the name of his son? Surely you know! 



















###### 5 









"Every word of God is flawless; he is a shield to those who take refuge in him. 



















###### 6 









Do not add to his words, or he will rebuke you and prove you a liar. 



















###### 7 









"Two things I ask of you, LORD; do not refuse me before I die: 



















###### 8 









Keep falsehood and lies far from me; give me neither poverty nor riches, but give me only my daily bread. 



















###### 9 









Otherwise, I may have too much and disown you and say, 'Who is the LORD?' Or I may become poor and steal, and so dishonor the name of my God. 



















###### 10 









"Do not slander a servant to their master, or they will curse you, and you will pay for it. 



















###### 11 









"There are those who curse their fathers and do not bless their mothers; 



















###### 12 









those who are pure in their own eyes and yet are not cleansed of their filth; 



















###### 13 









those whose eyes are ever so haughty, whose glances are so disdainful; 



















###### 14 









those whose teeth are swords and whose jaws are set with knives to devour the poor from the earth and the needy from among mankind. 



















###### 15 









"The leech has two daughters. 'Give! Give!' they cry. "There are three things that are never satisfied, four that never say, 'Enough!': 



















###### 16 









the grave, the barren womb, land, which is never satisfied with water, and fire, which never says, 'Enough!' 



















###### 17 









"The eye that mocks a father, that scorns an aged mother, will be pecked out by the ravens of the valley, will be eaten by the vultures. 



















###### 18 









"There are three things that are too amazing for me, four that I do not understand: 



















###### 19 









the way of an eagle in the sky, the way of a snake on a rock, the way of a ship on the high seas, and the way of a man with a young woman. 



















###### 20 









"This is the way of an adulterous woman: She eats and wipes her mouth and says, 'I've done nothing wrong.' 



















###### 21 









"Under three things the earth trembles, under four it cannot bear up: 



















###### 22 









a servant who becomes king, a godless fool who gets plenty to eat, 



















###### 23 









a contemptible woman who gets married, and a servant who displaces her mistress. 



















###### 24 









"Four things on earth are small, yet they are extremely wise: 



















###### 25 









Ants are creatures of little strength, yet they store up their food in the summer; 



















###### 26 









hyraxes are creatures of little power, yet they make their home in the crags; 



















###### 27 









locusts have no king, yet they advance together in ranks; 



















###### 28 









a lizard can be caught with the hand, yet it is found in kings' palaces. 



















###### 29 









"There are three things that are stately in their stride, four that move with stately bearing: 



















###### 30 









a lion, mighty among beasts, who retreats before nothing; 



















###### 31 









a strutting rooster, a he-goat, and a king secure against revolt.[^b] 



















###### 32 









"If you play the fool and exalt yourself, or if you plan evil, clap your hand over your mouth! 



















###### 33 









For as churning cream produces butter, and as twisting the nose produces blood, so stirring up anger produces strife." NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

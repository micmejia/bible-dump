# Proverbs 31

***




















###### 1 









The sayings of King Lemuel--an inspired utterance his mother taught him. 



















###### 2 









Listen, my son! Listen, son of my womb! Listen, my son, the answer to my prayers! 



















###### 3 









Do not spend your strength[^a] on women, your vigor on those who ruin kings. 



















###### 4 









It is not for kings, Lemuel-- it is not for kings to drink wine, not for rulers to crave beer, 



















###### 5 









lest they drink and forget what has been decreed, and deprive all the oppressed of their rights. 



















###### 6 









Let beer be for those who are perishing, wine for those who are in anguish! 



















###### 7 









Let them drink and forget their poverty and remember their misery no more. 



















###### 8 









Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all who are destitute. 



















###### 9 









Speak up and judge fairly; defend the rights of the poor and needy. ## Epilogue: The Wife of Noble Character 



















###### 10 









[^b]A wife of noble character who can find? She is worth far more than rubies. 



















###### 11 









Her husband has full confidence in her and lacks nothing of value. 



















###### 12 









She brings him good, not harm, all the days of her life. 



















###### 13 









She selects wool and flax and works with eager hands. 



















###### 14 









She is like the merchant ships, bringing her food from afar. 



















###### 15 









She gets up while it is still night; she provides food for her family and portions for her female servants. 



















###### 16 









She considers a field and buys it; out of her earnings she plants a vineyard. 



















###### 17 









She sets about her work vigorously; her arms are strong for her tasks. 



















###### 18 









She sees that her trading is profitable, and her lamp does not go out at night. 



















###### 19 









In her hand she holds the distaff and grasps the spindle with her fingers. 



















###### 20 









She opens her arms to the poor and extends her hands to the needy. 



















###### 21 









When it snows, she has no fear for her household; for all of them are clothed in scarlet. 



















###### 22 









She makes coverings for her bed; she is clothed in fine linen and purple. 



















###### 23 









Her husband is respected at the city gate, where he takes his seat among the elders of the land. 



















###### 24 









She makes linen garments and sells them, and supplies the merchants with sashes. 



















###### 25 









She is clothed with strength and dignity; she can laugh at the days to come. 



















###### 26 









She speaks with wisdom, and faithful instruction is on her tongue. 



















###### 27 









She watches over the affairs of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness. 



















###### 28 









Her children arise and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her: 



















###### 29 









"Many women do noble things, but you surpass them all." 



















###### 30 









Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting; but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised. 



















###### 31 









Honor her for all that her hands have done, and let her works bring her praise at the city gate. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

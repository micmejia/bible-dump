# Proverbs 4

***




















###### 1 









Listen, my sons, to a father's instruction; pay attention and gain understanding. 



















###### 2 









I give you sound learning, so do not forsake my teaching. 



















###### 3 









For I too was a son to my father, still tender, and cherished by my mother. 



















###### 4 









Then he taught me, and he said to me, "Take hold of my words with all your heart; keep my commands, and you will live. 



















###### 5 









Get wisdom, get understanding; do not forget my words or turn away from them. 



















###### 6 









Do not forsake wisdom, and she will protect you; love her, and she will watch over you. 



















###### 7 









The beginning of wisdom is this: Get[^a] wisdom. Though it cost all you have,[^b] get understanding. 



















###### 8 









Cherish her, and she will exalt you; embrace her, and she will honor you. 



















###### 9 









She will give you a garland to grace your head and present you with a glorious crown." 



















###### 10 









Listen, my son, accept what I say, and the years of your life will be many. 



















###### 11 









I instruct you in the way of wisdom and lead you along straight paths. 



















###### 12 









When you walk, your steps will not be hampered; when you run, you will not stumble. 



















###### 13 









Hold on to instruction, do not let it go; guard it well, for it is your life. 



















###### 14 









Do not set foot on the path of the wicked or walk in the way of evildoers. 



















###### 15 









Avoid it, do not travel on it; turn from it and go on your way. 



















###### 16 









For they cannot rest until they do evil; they are robbed of sleep till they make someone stumble. 



















###### 17 









They eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence. 



















###### 18 









The path of the righteous is like the morning sun, shining ever brighter till the full light of day. 



















###### 19 









But the way of the wicked is like deep darkness; they do not know what makes them stumble. 



















###### 20 









My son, pay attention to what I say; turn your ear to my words. 



















###### 21 









Do not let them out of your sight, keep them within your heart; 



















###### 22 









for they are life to those who find them and health to one's whole body. 



















###### 23 









Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it. 



















###### 24 









Keep your mouth free of perversity; keep corrupt talk far from your lips. 



















###### 25 









Let your eyes look straight ahead; fix your gaze directly before you. 



















###### 26 









Give careful thought to the[^c] paths for your feet and be steadfast in all your ways. 



















###### 27 









Do not turn to the right or the left; keep your foot from evil. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

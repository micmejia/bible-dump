# Proverbs 5

***




















###### 1 









My son, pay attention to my wisdom, turn your ear to my words of insight, 



















###### 2 









that you may maintain discretion and your lips may preserve knowledge. 



















###### 3 









For the lips of the adulterous woman drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil; 



















###### 4 









but in the end she is bitter as gall, sharp as a double-edged sword. 



















###### 5 









Her feet go down to death; her steps lead straight to the grave. 



















###### 6 









She gives no thought to the way of life; her paths wander aimlessly, but she does not know it. 



















###### 7 









Now then, my sons, listen to me; do not turn aside from what I say. 



















###### 8 









Keep to a path far from her, do not go near the door of her house, 



















###### 9 









lest you lose your honor to others and your dignity[^a] to one who is cruel, 



















###### 10 









lest strangers feast on your wealth and your toil enrich the house of another. 



















###### 11 









At the end of your life you will groan, when your flesh and body are spent. 



















###### 12 









You will say, "How I hated discipline! How my heart spurned correction! 



















###### 13 









I would not obey my teachers or turn my ear to my instructors. 



















###### 14 









And I was soon in serious trouble in the assembly of God's people." 



















###### 15 









Drink water from your own cistern, running water from your own well. 



















###### 16 









Should your springs overflow in the streets, your streams of water in the public squares? 



















###### 17 









Let them be yours alone, never to be shared with strangers. 



















###### 18 









May your fountain be blessed, and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth. 



















###### 19 









A loving doe, a graceful deer-- may her breasts satisfy you always, may you ever be intoxicated with her love. 



















###### 20 









Why, my son, be intoxicated with another man's wife? Why embrace the bosom of a wayward woman? 



















###### 21 









For your ways are in full view of the LORD, and he examines all your paths. 



















###### 22 









The evil deeds of the wicked ensnare them; the cords of their sins hold them fast. 



















###### 23 









For lack of discipline they will die, led astray by their own great folly. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

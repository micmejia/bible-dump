# Proverbs 6

***




















###### 1 









My son, if you have put up security for your neighbor, if you have shaken hands in pledge for a stranger, 



















###### 2 









you have been trapped by what you said, ensnared by the words of your mouth. 



















###### 3 









So do this, my son, to free yourself, since you have fallen into your neighbor's hands: Go--to the point of exhaustion--[^a] and give your neighbor no rest! 



















###### 4 









Allow no sleep to your eyes, no slumber to your eyelids. 



















###### 5 









Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, like a bird from the snare of the fowler. 



















###### 6 









Go to the ant, you sluggard; consider its ways and be wise! 



















###### 7 









It has no commander, no overseer or ruler, 



















###### 8 









yet it stores its provisions in summer and gathers its food at harvest. 



















###### 9 









How long will you lie there, you sluggard? When will you get up from your sleep? 



















###### 10 









A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest-- 



















###### 11 









and poverty will come on you like a thief and scarcity like an armed man. 



















###### 12 









A troublemaker and a villain, who goes about with a corrupt mouth, 



















###### 13 









who winks maliciously with his eye, signals with his feet and motions with his fingers, 



















###### 14 









who plots evil with deceit in his heart-- he always stirs up conflict. 



















###### 15 









Therefore disaster will overtake him in an instant; he will suddenly be destroyed--without remedy. 



















###### 16 









There are six things the LORD hates, seven that are detestable to him: 



















###### 17 









haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood, 



















###### 18 









a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that are quick to rush into evil, 



















###### 19 









a false witness who pours out lies and a person who stirs up conflict in the community. ## Warning Against Adultery 



















###### 20 









My son, keep your father's command and do not forsake your mother's teaching. 



















###### 21 









Bind them always on your heart; fasten them around your neck. 



















###### 22 









When you walk, they will guide you; when you sleep, they will watch over you; when you awake, they will speak to you. 



















###### 23 









For this command is a lamp, this teaching is a light, and correction and instruction are the way to life, 



















###### 24 









keeping you from your neighbor's wife, from the smooth talk of a wayward woman. 



















###### 25 









Do not lust in your heart after her beauty or let her captivate you with her eyes. 



















###### 26 









For a prostitute can be had for a loaf of bread, but another man's wife preys on your very life. 



















###### 27 









Can a man scoop fire into his lap without his clothes being burned? 



















###### 28 









Can a man walk on hot coals without his feet being scorched? 



















###### 29 









So is he who sleeps with another man's wife; no one who touches her will go unpunished. 



















###### 30 









People do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy his hunger when he is starving. 



















###### 31 









Yet if he is caught, he must pay sevenfold, though it costs him all the wealth of his house. 



















###### 32 









But a man who commits adultery has no sense; whoever does so destroys himself. 



















###### 33 









Blows and disgrace are his lot, and his shame will never be wiped away. 



















###### 34 









For jealousy arouses a husband's fury, and he will show no mercy when he takes revenge. 



















###### 35 









He will not accept any compensation; he will refuse a bribe, however great it is. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

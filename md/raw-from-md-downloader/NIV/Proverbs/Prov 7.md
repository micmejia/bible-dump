# Proverbs 7

***




















###### 1 









My son, keep my words and store up my commands within you. 



















###### 2 









Keep my commands and you will live; guard my teachings as the apple of your eye. 



















###### 3 









Bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart. 



















###### 4 









Say to wisdom, "You are my sister," and to insight, "You are my relative." 



















###### 5 









They will keep you from the adulterous woman, from the wayward woman with her seductive words. 



















###### 6 









At the window of my house I looked down through the lattice. 



















###### 7 









I saw among the simple, I noticed among the young men, a youth who had no sense. 



















###### 8 









He was going down the street near her corner, walking along in the direction of her house 



















###### 9 









at twilight, as the day was fading, as the dark of night set in. 



















###### 10 









Then out came a woman to meet him, dressed like a prostitute and with crafty intent. 



















###### 11 









(She is unruly and defiant, her feet never stay at home; 



















###### 12 









now in the street, now in the squares, at every corner she lurks.) 



















###### 13 









She took hold of him and kissed him and with a brazen face she said: 



















###### 14 









"Today I fulfilled my vows, and I have food from my fellowship offering at home. 



















###### 15 









So I came out to meet you; I looked for you and have found you! 



















###### 16 









I have covered my bed with colored linens from Egypt. 



















###### 17 









I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes and cinnamon. 



















###### 18 









Come, let's drink deeply of love till morning; let's enjoy ourselves with love! 



















###### 19 









My husband is not at home; he has gone on a long journey. 



















###### 20 









He took his purse filled with money and will not be home till full moon." 



















###### 21 









With persuasive words she led him astray; she seduced him with her smooth talk. 



















###### 22 









All at once he followed her like an ox going to the slaughter, like a deer[^a] stepping into a noose[^b] 



















###### 23 









till an arrow pierces his liver, like a bird darting into a snare, little knowing it will cost him his life. 



















###### 24 









Now then, my sons, listen to me; pay attention to what I say. 



















###### 25 









Do not let your heart turn to her ways or stray into her paths. 



















###### 26 









Many are the victims she has brought down; her slain are a mighty throng. 



















###### 27 









Her house is a highway to the grave, leading down to the chambers of death. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

# Proverbs 8

***




















###### 1 









Does not wisdom call out? Does not understanding raise her voice? 



















###### 2 









At the highest point along the way, where the paths meet, she takes her stand; 



















###### 3 









beside the gate leading into the city, at the entrance, she cries aloud: 



















###### 4 









"To you, O people, I call out; I raise my voice to all mankind. 



















###### 5 









You who are simple, gain prudence; you who are foolish, set your hearts on it.[^a] 



















###### 6 









Listen, for I have trustworthy things to say; I open my lips to speak what is right. 



















###### 7 









My mouth speaks what is true, for my lips detest wickedness. 



















###### 8 









All the words of my mouth are just; none of them is crooked or perverse. 



















###### 9 









To the discerning all of them are right; they are upright to those who have found knowledge. 



















###### 10 









Choose my instruction instead of silver, knowledge rather than choice gold, 



















###### 11 









for wisdom is more precious than rubies, and nothing you desire can compare with her. 



















###### 12 









"I, wisdom, dwell together with prudence; I possess knowledge and discretion. 



















###### 13 









To fear the LORD is to hate evil; I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior and perverse speech. 



















###### 14 









Counsel and sound judgment are mine; I have insight, I have power. 



















###### 15 









By me kings reign and rulers issue decrees that are just; 



















###### 16 









by me princes govern, and nobles--all who rule on earth.[^b] 



















###### 17 









I love those who love me, and those who seek me find me. 



















###### 18 









With me are riches and honor, enduring wealth and prosperity. 



















###### 19 









My fruit is better than fine gold; what I yield surpasses choice silver. 



















###### 20 









I walk in the way of righteousness, along the paths of justice, 



















###### 21 









bestowing a rich inheritance on those who love me and making their treasuries full. 



















###### 22 









"The LORD brought me forth as the first of his works,[^c][^d] before his deeds of old; 



















###### 23 









I was formed long ages ago, at the very beginning, when the world came to be. 



















###### 24 









When there were no watery depths, I was given birth, when there were no springs overflowing with water; 



















###### 25 









before the mountains were settled in place, before the hills, I was given birth, 



















###### 26 









before he made the world or its fields or any of the dust of the earth. 



















###### 27 









I was there when he set the heavens in place, when he marked out the horizon on the face of the deep, 



















###### 28 









when he established the clouds above and fixed securely the fountains of the deep, 



















###### 29 









when he gave the sea its boundary so the waters would not overstep his command, and when he marked out the foundations of the earth. 



















###### 30 









Then I was constantly[^e] at his side. I was filled with delight day after day, rejoicing always in his presence, 



















###### 31 









rejoicing in his whole world and delighting in mankind. 



















###### 32 









"Now then, my children, listen to me; blessed are those who keep my ways. 



















###### 33 









Listen to my instruction and be wise; do not disregard it. 



















###### 34 









Blessed are those who listen to me, watching daily at my doors, waiting at my doorway. 



















###### 35 









For those who find me find life and receive favor from the LORD. 



















###### 36 









But those who fail to find me harm themselves; all who hate me love death." NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

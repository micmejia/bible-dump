# Proverbs 9

***




















###### 1 









Wisdom has built her house; she has set up[^a] its seven pillars. 



















###### 2 









She has prepared her meat and mixed her wine; she has also set her table. 



















###### 3 









She has sent out her servants, and she calls from the highest point of the city, 



















###### 4 









"Let all who are simple come to my house!" To those who have no sense she says, 



















###### 5 









"Come, eat my food and drink the wine I have mixed. 



















###### 6 









Leave your simple ways and you will live; walk in the way of insight." 



















###### 7 









Whoever corrects a mocker invites insults; whoever rebukes the wicked incurs abuse. 



















###### 8 









Do not rebuke mockers or they will hate you; rebuke the wise and they will love you. 



















###### 9 









Instruct the wise and they will be wiser still; teach the righteous and they will add to their learning. 



















###### 10 









The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding. 



















###### 11 









For through wisdom[^b] your days will be many, and years will be added to your life. 



















###### 12 









If you are wise, your wisdom will reward you; if you are a mocker, you alone will suffer. 



















###### 13 









Folly is an unruly woman; she is simple and knows nothing. 



















###### 14 









She sits at the door of her house, on a seat at the highest point of the city, 



















###### 15 









calling out to those who pass by, who go straight on their way, 



















###### 16 









"Let all who are simple come to my house!" To those who have no sense she says, 



















###### 17 









"Stolen water is sweet; food eaten in secret is delicious!" 



















###### 18 









But little do they know that the dead are there, that her guests are deep in the realm of the dead. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

# Psalms 1

***




















###### 1 









Blessed is the one who does not walk in step with the wicked or stand in the way that sinners take or sit in the company of mockers, 



















###### 2 









but whose delight is in the law of the LORD, and who meditates on his law day and night. 



















###### 3 









That person is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither-- whatever they do prospers. 



















###### 4 









Not so the wicked! They are like chaff that the wind blows away. 



















###### 5 









Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous. 



















###### 6 









For the LORD watches over the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked leads to destruction. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

# Psalms 11

***




















###### 1 









In the LORD I take refuge. How then can you say to me: "Flee like a bird to your mountain. 



















###### 2 









For look, the wicked bend their bows; they set their arrows against the strings to shoot from the shadows at the upright in heart. 



















###### 3 









When the foundations are being destroyed, what can the righteous do?" 



















###### 4 









The LORD is in his holy temple; the LORD is on his heavenly throne. He observes everyone on earth; his eyes examine them. 



















###### 5 









The LORD examines the righteous, but the wicked, those who love violence, he hates with a passion. 



















###### 6 









On the wicked he will rain fiery coals and burning sulfur; a scorching wind will be their lot. 



















###### 7 









For the LORD is righteous, he loves justice; the upright will see his face. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

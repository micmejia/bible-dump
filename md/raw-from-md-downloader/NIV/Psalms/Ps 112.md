Their children will be mighty in the land; the generation of the upright will be blessed.

Wealth and riches are in their houses, and their righteousness endures forever. 



















###### 4 









Even in darkness light dawns for the upright, for those who are gracious and compassionate and righteous. 



















###### 5 









Good will come to those who are generous and lend freely, who conduct their affairs with justice. 



















###### 6 









Surely the righteous will never be shaken; they will be remembered forever. 



















###### 7 









They will have no fear of bad news; their hearts are steadfast, trusting in the LORD. 



















###### 8 









Their hearts are secure, they will have no fear; in the end they will look in triumph on their foes.

They have freely scattered their gifts to the poor, their righteousness endures forever; their horn[^c] will be lifted high in honor.

The wicked will see and be vexed, they will gnash their teeth and waste away; the longings of the wicked will come to nothing. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

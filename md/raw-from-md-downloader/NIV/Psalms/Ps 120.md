# Psalms 120

***




















###### 1 









I call on the LORD in my distress, and he answers me. 



















###### 2 









Save me, LORD, from lying lips and from deceitful tongues. 



















###### 3 









What will he do to you, and what more besides, you deceitful tongue? 



















###### 4 









He will punish you with a warrior's sharp arrows, with burning coals of the broom bush. 



















###### 5 









Woe to me that I dwell in Meshek, that I live among the tents of Kedar! 



















###### 6 









Too long have I lived among those who hate peace. 



















###### 7 









I am for peace; but when I speak, they are for war. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

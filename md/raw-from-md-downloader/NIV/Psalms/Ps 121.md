I lift up my eyes to the mountains-- where does my help come from? 



















###### 2 









My help comes from the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth. 



















###### 3 









He will not let your foot slip-- he who watches over you will not slumber; 



















###### 4 









indeed, he who watches over Israel will neither slumber nor sleep. 



















###### 5 









The LORD watches over you-- the LORD is your shade at your right hand; 



















###### 6 









the sun will not harm you by day, nor the moon by night. 



















###### 7 









The LORD will keep you from all harm-- he will watch over your life; 



















###### 8 









the LORD will watch over your coming and going both now and forevermore. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

# Psalms 123

***




















###### 1 









I lift up my eyes to you, to you who sit enthroned in heaven. 



















###### 2 









As the eyes of slaves look to the hand of their master, as the eyes of a female slave look to the hand of her mistress, so our eyes look to the LORD our God, till he shows us his mercy. 



















###### 3 









Have mercy on us, LORD, have mercy on us, for we have endured no end of contempt. 



















###### 4 









We have endured no end of ridicule from the arrogant, of contempt from the proud. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

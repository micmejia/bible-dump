# Psalms 124

***




















###### 1 









If the LORD had not been on our side-- let Israel say-- 



















###### 2 









if the LORD had not been on our side when people attacked us, 



















###### 3 









they would have swallowed us alive when their anger flared against us; 



















###### 4 









the flood would have engulfed us, the torrent would have swept over us, 



















###### 5 









the raging waters would have swept us away. 



















###### 6 









Praise be to the LORD, who has not let us be torn by their teeth. 



















###### 7 









We have escaped like a bird from the fowler's snare; the snare has been broken, and we have escaped. 



















###### 8

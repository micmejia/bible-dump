# Psalms 125

***




















###### 1 









Those who trust in the LORD are like Mount Zion, which cannot be shaken but endures forever. 



















###### 2 









As the mountains surround Jerusalem, so the LORD surrounds his people both now and forevermore. 



















###### 3 









The scepter of the wicked will not remain over the land allotted to the righteous, for then the righteous might use their hands to do evil. 



















###### 4 









LORD, do good to those who are good, to those who are upright in heart. 



















###### 5 









But those who turn to crooked ways the LORD will banish with the evildoers. Peace be on Israel. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

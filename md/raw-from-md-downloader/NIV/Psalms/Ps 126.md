# Psalms 126

***




















###### 1 









When the LORD restored the fortunes of[^a] Zion, we were like those who dreamed.[^b] 



















###### 2 









Our mouths were filled with laughter, our tongues with songs of joy. Then it was said among the nations, "The LORD has done great things for them." 



















###### 3 









The LORD has done great things for us, and we are filled with joy. 



















###### 4 









Restore our fortunes,[^c] LORD, like streams in the Negev. 



















###### 5 









Those who sow with tears will reap with songs of joy. 



















###### 6 









Those who go out weeping, carrying seed to sow, will return with songs of joy, carrying sheaves with them. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

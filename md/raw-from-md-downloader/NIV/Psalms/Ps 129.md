# Psalms 129

***




















###### 1 









"They have greatly oppressed me from my youth," let Israel say; 



















###### 2 









"they have greatly oppressed me from my youth, but they have not gained the victory over me. 



















###### 3 









Plowmen have plowed my back and made their furrows long. 



















###### 4 









But the LORD is righteous; he has cut me free from the cords of the wicked." 



















###### 5 









May all who hate Zion be turned back in shame. 



















###### 6 









May they be like grass on the roof, which withers before it can grow; 



















###### 7 









a reaper cannot fill his hands with it, nor one who gathers fill his arms. 



















###### 8 









May those who pass by not say to them, "The blessing of the LORD be on you; we bless you in the name of the LORD." NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

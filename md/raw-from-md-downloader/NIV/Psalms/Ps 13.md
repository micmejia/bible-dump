# Psalms 13

***




















###### 1 









How long, LORD? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me? 



















###### 2 









How long must I wrestle with my thoughts and day after day have sorrow in my heart? How long will my enemy triumph over me? 



















###### 3 









Look on me and answer, LORD my God. Give light to my eyes, or I will sleep in death, 



















###### 4 









and my enemy will say, "I have overcome him," and my foes will rejoice when I fall. 



















###### 5 









But I trust in your unfailing love; my heart rejoices in your salvation. 



















###### 6 









I will sing the LORD's praise, for he has been good to me. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

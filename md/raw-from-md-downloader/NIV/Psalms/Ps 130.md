# Psalms 130

***




















###### 1 









Out of the depths I cry to you, LORD; 



















###### 2 









Lord, hear my voice. Let your ears be attentive to my cry for mercy. 



















###### 3 









If you, LORD, kept a record of sins, Lord, who could stand? 



















###### 4 









But with you there is forgiveness, so that we can, with reverence, serve you. 



















###### 5 









I wait for the LORD, my whole being waits, and in his word I put my hope. 



















###### 6 









I wait for the Lord more than watchmen wait for the morning, more than watchmen wait for the morning. 



















###### 7 









Israel, put your hope in the LORD, for with the LORD is unfailing love and with him is full redemption. 



















###### 8 









He himself will redeem Israel from all their sins. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

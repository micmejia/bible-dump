# Psalms 131

***




















###### 1 









My heart is not proud, LORD, my eyes are not haughty; I do not concern myself with great matters or things too wonderful for me. 



















###### 2 









But I have calmed and quieted myself, I am like a weaned child with its mother; like a weaned child I am content. 



















###### 3

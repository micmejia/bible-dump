# Psalms 133

***




















###### 1 









How good and pleasant it is when God's people live together in unity! 



















###### 2 









It is like precious oil poured on the head, running down on the beard, running down on Aaron's beard, down on the collar of his robe. 



















###### 3 









It is as if the dew of Hermon were falling on Mount Zion. For there the LORD bestows his blessing, even life forevermore. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

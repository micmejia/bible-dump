# Psalms 14

***




















###### 1 









The fool[^a] says in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt, their deeds are vile; there is no one who does good. 



















###### 2 









The LORD looks down from heaven on all mankind to see if there are any who understand, any who seek God. 



















###### 3 









All have turned away, all have become corrupt; there is no one who does good, not even one. 



















###### 4 









Do all these evildoers know nothing? They devour my people as though eating bread; they never call on the LORD. 



















###### 5 









But there they are, overwhelmed with dread, for God is present in the company of the righteous. 



















###### 6 









You evildoers frustrate the plans of the poor, but the LORD is their refuge. 



















###### 7 









Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When the LORD restores his people, let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad! NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

# Psalms 140

***




















###### 1 









Rescue me, LORD, from evildoers; protect me from the violent, 



















###### 2 









who devise evil plans in their hearts and stir up war every day. 



















###### 3 









They make their tongues as sharp as a serpent's; the poison of vipers is on their lips.[^b] 



















###### 4 









Keep me safe, LORD, from the hands of the wicked; protect me from the violent, who devise ways to trip my feet. 



















###### 5 









The arrogant have hidden a snare for me; they have spread out the cords of their net and have set traps for me along my path. 



















###### 6 









I say to the LORD, "You are my God." Hear, LORD, my cry for mercy. 



















###### 7 









Sovereign LORD, my strong deliverer, you shield my head in the day of battle. 



















###### 8 









Do not grant the wicked their desires, LORD; do not let their plans succeed. 



















###### 9 









Those who surround me proudly rear their heads; may the mischief of their lips engulf them. 



















###### 10 









May burning coals fall on them; may they be thrown into the fire, into miry pits, never to rise. 



















###### 11 









May slanderers not be established in the land; may disaster hunt down the violent. 



















###### 12 









I know that the LORD secures justice for the poor and upholds the cause of the needy. 



















###### 13 









Surely the righteous will praise your name, and the upright will live in your presence. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

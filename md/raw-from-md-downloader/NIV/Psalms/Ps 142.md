# Psalms 142

***




















###### 1 









I cry aloud to the LORD; I lift up my voice to the LORD for mercy. 



















###### 2 









I pour out before him my complaint; before him I tell my trouble. 



















###### 3 









When my spirit grows faint within me, it is you who watch over my way. In the path where I walk people have hidden a snare for me. 



















###### 4 









Look and see, there is no one at my right hand; no one is concerned for me. I have no refuge; no one cares for my life. 



















###### 5 









I cry to you, LORD; I say, "You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living." 



















###### 6 









Listen to my cry, for I am in desperate need; rescue me from those who pursue me, for they are too strong for me. 



















###### 7 









Set me free from my prison, that I may praise your name. Then the righteous will gather about me because of your goodness to me. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

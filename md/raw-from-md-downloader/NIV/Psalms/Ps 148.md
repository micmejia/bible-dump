Praise the LORD.[^a] Praise the LORD from the heavens; praise him in the heights above.

Praise him, all his angels; praise him, all his heavenly hosts.

Praise him, sun and moon; praise him, all you shining stars. 



















###### 4 









Praise him, you highest heavens and you waters above the skies. 



















###### 5 









Let them praise the name of the LORD, for at his command they were created, 



















###### 6 









and he established them for ever and ever-- he issued a decree that will never pass away. 



















###### 7 









Praise the LORD from the earth, you great sea creatures and all ocean depths, 



















###### 8 









lightning and hail, snow and clouds, stormy winds that do his bidding, 



















###### 9 









you mountains and all hills, fruit trees and all cedars, 



















###### 10 









wild animals and all cattle, small creatures and flying birds, 



















###### 11 









kings of the earth and all nations, you princes and all rulers on earth, 



















###### 12 









young men and women, old men and children. 



















###### 13 









Let them praise the name of the LORD, for his name alone is exalted; his splendor is above the earth and the heavens. 



















###### 14 









And he has raised up for his people a horn,[^b] the praise of all his faithful servants, of Israel, the people close to his heart. Praise the LORD.

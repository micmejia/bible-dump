# Psalms 149

***




















###### 1 









Praise the LORD.[^a] Sing to the LORD a new song, his praise in the assembly of his faithful people. 



















###### 2 









Let Israel rejoice in their Maker; let the people of Zion be glad in their King. 



















###### 3 









Let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with timbrel and harp. 



















###### 4 









For the LORD takes delight in his people; he crowns the humble with victory. 



















###### 5 









Let his faithful people rejoice in this honor and sing for joy on their beds. 



















###### 6 









May the praise of God be in their mouths and a double-edged sword in their hands, 



















###### 7 









to inflict vengeance on the nations and punishment on the peoples, 



















###### 8 









to bind their kings with fetters, their nobles with shackles of iron, 



















###### 9 









to carry out the sentence written against them-- this is the glory of all his faithful people. Praise the LORD. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

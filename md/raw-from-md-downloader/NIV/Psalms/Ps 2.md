# Psalms 2

***




















###### 1 









Why do the nations conspire[^a] and the peoples plot in vain? 



















###### 2 









The kings of the earth rise up and the rulers band together against the LORD and against his anointed, saying, 



















###### 3 









"Let us break their chains and throw off their shackles." 



















###### 4 









The One enthroned in heaven laughs; the Lord scoffs at them. 



















###### 5 









He rebukes them in his anger and terrifies them in his wrath, saying, 



















###### 6 









"I have installed my king on Zion, my holy mountain." 



















###### 7 









I will proclaim the LORD's decree: He said to me, "You are my son; today I have become your father. 



















###### 8 









Ask me, and I will make the nations your inheritance, the ends of the earth your possession. 



















###### 9 









You will break them with a rod of iron[^b]; you will dash them to pieces like pottery." 



















###### 10 









Therefore, you kings, be wise; be warned, you rulers of the earth. 



















###### 11 









Serve the LORD with fear and celebrate his rule with trembling. 



















###### 12 









Kiss his son, or he will be angry and your way will lead to your destruction, for his wrath can flare up in a moment. Blessed are all who take refuge in him.

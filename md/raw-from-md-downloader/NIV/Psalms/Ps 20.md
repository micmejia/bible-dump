###### 5 









May we shout for joy over your victory and lift up our banners in the name of our God. May the LORD grant all your requests.

###### 7 









Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the LORD our God.

They are brought to their knees and fall, but we rise up and stand firm.

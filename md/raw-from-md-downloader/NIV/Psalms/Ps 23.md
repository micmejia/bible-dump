***




















###### 1 









The LORD is my shepherd, I lack nothing. 



















###### 2 









He makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters, 



















###### 3 









he refreshes my soul. He guides me along the right paths for his name's sake. 



















###### 4 









Even though I walk through the darkest valley,[^a] I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me. 



















###### 5 









You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. 



















###### 6 









Surely your goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

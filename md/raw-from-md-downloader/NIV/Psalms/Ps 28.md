# Psalms 28

***




















###### 1 









To you, LORD, I call; you are my Rock, do not turn a deaf ear to me. For if you remain silent, I will be like those who go down to the pit. 



















###### 2 









Hear my cry for mercy as I call to you for help, as I lift up my hands toward your Most Holy Place. 



















###### 3 









Do not drag me away with the wicked, with those who do evil, who speak cordially with their neighbors but harbor malice in their hearts. 



















###### 4 









Repay them for their deeds and for their evil work; repay them for what their hands have done and bring back on them what they deserve. 



















###### 5 









Because they have no regard for the deeds of the LORD and what his hands have done, he will tear them down and never build them up again. 



















###### 6 









Praise be to the LORD, for he has heard my cry for mercy. 



















###### 7 









The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusts in him, and he helps me. My heart leaps for joy, and with my song I praise him. 



















###### 8 









The LORD is the strength of his people, a fortress of salvation for his anointed one. 



















###### 9

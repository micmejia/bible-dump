# Psalms 3

***




















###### 1 









LORD, how many are my foes! How many rise up against me! 



















###### 2 









Many are saying of me, "God will not deliver him."[^b] 



















###### 3 









But you, LORD, are a shield around me, my glory, the One who lifts my head high. 



















###### 4 









I call out to the LORD, and he answers me from his holy mountain. 



















###### 5 









I lie down and sleep; I wake again, because the LORD sustains me. 



















###### 6 









I will not fear though tens of thousands assail me on every side. 



















###### 7 









Arise, LORD! Deliver me, my God! Strike all my enemies on the jaw; break the teeth of the wicked. 



















###### 8

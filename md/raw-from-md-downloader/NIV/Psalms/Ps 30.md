# Psalms 30

***




















###### 1 









I will exalt you, LORD, for you lifted me out of the depths and did not let my enemies gloat over me. 



















###### 2 









LORD my God, I called to you for help, and you healed me. 



















###### 3 









You, LORD, brought me up from the realm of the dead; you spared me from going down to the pit. 



















###### 4 









Sing the praises of the LORD, you his faithful people; praise his holy name. 



















###### 5 









For his anger lasts only a moment, but his favor lasts a lifetime; weeping may stay for the night, but rejoicing comes in the morning. 



















###### 6 









When I felt secure, I said, "I will never be shaken." 



















###### 7 









LORD, when you favored me, you made my royal mountain[^c] stand firm; but when you hid your face, I was dismayed. 



















###### 8 









To you, LORD, I called; to the Lord I cried for mercy: 



















###### 9 









"What is gained if I am silenced, if I go down to the pit? Will the dust praise you? Will it proclaim your faithfulness? 



















###### 10 









Hear, LORD, and be merciful to me; LORD, be my help." 



















###### 11 









You turned my wailing into dancing; you removed my sackcloth and clothed me with joy, 



















###### 12 









that my heart may sing your praises and not be silent. LORD my God, I will praise you forever. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

# Psalms 32

***




















###### 1 









Blessed is the one whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered. 



















###### 2 









Blessed is the one whose sin the LORD does not count against them and in whose spirit is no deceit. 



















###### 3 









When I kept silent, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long. 



















###### 4 









For day and night your hand was heavy on me; my strength was sapped as in the heat of summer.[^b] 



















###### 5 









Then I acknowledged my sin to you and did not cover up my iniquity. I said, "I will confess my transgressions to the LORD." And you forgave the guilt of my sin. 



















###### 6 









Therefore let all the faithful pray to you while you may be found; surely the rising of the mighty waters will not reach them. 



















###### 7 









You are my hiding place; you will protect me from trouble and surround me with songs of deliverance. 



















###### 8 









I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; I will counsel you with my loving eye on you. 



















###### 9 









Do not be like the horse or the mule, which have no understanding but must be controlled by bit and bridle or they will not come to you. 



















###### 10 









Many are the woes of the wicked, but the LORD's unfailing love surrounds the one who trusts in him. 



















###### 11 









Rejoice in the LORD and be glad, you righteous; sing, all you who are upright in heart! NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

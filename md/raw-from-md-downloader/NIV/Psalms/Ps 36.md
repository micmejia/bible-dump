# Psalms 36

***




















###### 1 









I have a message from God in my heart concerning the sinfulness of the wicked:[^b] There is no fear of God before their eyes. 



















###### 2 









In their own eyes they flatter themselves too much to detect or hate their sin. 



















###### 3 









The words of their mouths are wicked and deceitful; they fail to act wisely or do good. 



















###### 4 









Even on their beds they plot evil; they commit themselves to a sinful course and do not reject what is wrong. 



















###### 5 









Your love, LORD, reaches to the heavens, your faithfulness to the skies. 



















###### 6 









Your righteousness is like the highest mountains, your justice like the great deep. You, LORD, preserve both people and animals. 



















###### 7 









How priceless is your unfailing love, O God! People take refuge in the shadow of your wings. 



















###### 8 









They feast on the abundance of your house; you give them drink from your river of delights. 



















###### 9 









For with you is the fountain of life; in your light we see light. 



















###### 10 









Continue your love to those who know you, your righteousness to the upright in heart. 



















###### 11 









May the foot of the proud not come against me, nor the hand of the wicked drive me away. 



















###### 12

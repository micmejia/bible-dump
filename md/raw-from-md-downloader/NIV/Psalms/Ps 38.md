# Psalms 38

***




















###### 1 









LORD, do not rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your wrath. 



















###### 2 









Your arrows have pierced me, and your hand has come down on me. 



















###### 3 









Because of your wrath there is no health in my body; there is no soundness in my bones because of my sin. 



















###### 4 









My guilt has overwhelmed me like a burden too heavy to bear. 



















###### 5 









My wounds fester and are loathsome because of my sinful folly. 



















###### 6 









I am bowed down and brought very low; all day long I go about mourning. 



















###### 7 









My back is filled with searing pain; there is no health in my body. 



















###### 8 









I am feeble and utterly crushed; I groan in anguish of heart. 



















###### 9 









All my longings lie open before you, Lord; my sighing is not hidden from you. 



















###### 10 









My heart pounds, my strength fails me; even the light has gone from my eyes. 



















###### 11 









My friends and companions avoid me because of my wounds; my neighbors stay far away. 



















###### 12 









Those who want to kill me set their traps, those who would harm me talk of my ruin; all day long they scheme and lie. 



















###### 13 









I am like the deaf, who cannot hear, like the mute, who cannot speak; 



















###### 14 









I have become like one who does not hear, whose mouth can offer no reply. 



















###### 15 









LORD, I wait for you; you will answer, Lord my God. 



















###### 16 









For I said, "Do not let them gloat or exalt themselves over me when my feet slip." 



















###### 17 









For I am about to fall, and my pain is ever with me. 



















###### 18 









I confess my iniquity; I am troubled by my sin. 



















###### 19 









Many have become my enemies without cause[^b]; those who hate me without reason are numerous. 



















###### 20 









Those who repay my good with evil lodge accusations against me, though I seek only to do what is good. 



















###### 21 









LORD, do not forsake me; do not be far from me, my God. 



















###### 22

# Psalms 42

***




















###### 1 









As the deer pants for streams of water, so my soul pants for you, my God. 



















###### 2 









My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When can I go and meet with God? 



















###### 3 









My tears have been my food day and night, while people say to me all day long, "Where is your God?" 



















###### 4 









These things I remember as I pour out my soul: how I used to go to the house of God under the protection of the Mighty One[^d] with shouts of joy and praise among the festive throng. 



















###### 5 









Why, my soul, are you downcast? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and my God. 



















###### 6 









My soul is downcast within me; therefore I will remember you from the land of the Jordan, the heights of Hermon--from Mount Mizar. 



















###### 7 









Deep calls to deep in the roar of your waterfalls; all your waves and breakers have swept over me. 



















###### 8 









By day the LORD directs his love, at night his song is with me-- a prayer to the God of my life. 



















###### 9 









I say to God my Rock, "Why have you forgotten me? Why must I go about mourning, oppressed by the enemy?" 



















###### 10 









My bones suffer mortal agony as my foes taunt me, saying to me all day long, "Where is your God?" 



















###### 11 









Why, my soul, are you downcast? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and my God.

# Psalms 43

***




















###### 1 









Vindicate me, my God, and plead my cause against an unfaithful nation. Rescue me from those who are deceitful and wicked. 



















###### 2 









You are God my stronghold. Why have you rejected me? Why must I go about mourning, oppressed by the enemy? 



















###### 3 









Send me your light and your faithful care, let them lead me; let them bring me to your holy mountain, to the place where you dwell. 



















###### 4 









Then I will go to the altar of God, to God, my joy and my delight. I will praise you with the lyre, O God, my God. 



















###### 5 









Why, my soul, are you downcast? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and my God.

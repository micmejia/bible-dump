# Psalms 46

***




















###### 1 









God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble. 



















###### 2 









Therefore we will not fear, though the earth give way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea, 



















###### 3 









though its waters roar and foam and the mountains quake with their surging.[^c] 



















###### 4 









There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy place where the Most High dwells. 



















###### 5 









God is within her, she will not fall; God will help her at break of day. 



















###### 6 









Nations are in uproar, kingdoms fall; he lifts his voice, the earth melts. 



















###### 7 









The LORD Almighty is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress. 



















###### 8 









Come and see what the LORD has done, the desolations he has brought on the earth. 



















###### 9 









He makes wars cease to the ends of the earth. He breaks the bow and shatters the spear; he burns the shields[^d] with fire. 



















###### 10 









He says, "Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth." 



















###### 11

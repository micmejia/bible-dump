# Psalms 48

***




















###### 1 









Great is the LORD, and most worthy of praise, in the city of our God, his holy mountain. 



















###### 2 









Beautiful in its loftiness, the joy of the whole earth, like the heights of Zaphon[^b] is Mount Zion, the city of the Great King. 



















###### 3 









God is in her citadels; he has shown himself to be her fortress. 



















###### 4 









When the kings joined forces, when they advanced together, 



















###### 5 









they saw her and were astounded; they fled in terror. 



















###### 6 









Trembling seized them there, pain like that of a woman in labor. 



















###### 7 









You destroyed them like ships of Tarshish shattered by an east wind. 



















###### 8 









As we have heard, so we have seen in the city of the LORD Almighty, in the city of our God: God makes her secure forever.[^c] 



















###### 9 









Within your temple, O God, we meditate on your unfailing love. 



















###### 10 









Like your name, O God, your praise reaches to the ends of the earth; your right hand is filled with righteousness. 



















###### 11 









Mount Zion rejoices, the villages of Judah are glad because of your judgments. 



















###### 12 









Walk about Zion, go around her, count her towers, 



















###### 13 









consider well her ramparts, view her citadels, that you may tell of them to the next generation. 



















###### 14

# Psalms 49

***




















###### 1 









Hear this, all you peoples; listen, all who live in this world, 



















###### 2 









both low and high, rich and poor alike: 



















###### 3 









My mouth will speak words of wisdom; the meditation of my heart will give you understanding. 



















###### 4 









I will turn my ear to a proverb; with the harp I will expound my riddle: 



















###### 5 









Why should I fear when evil days come, when wicked deceivers surround me-- 



















###### 6 









those who trust in their wealth and boast of their great riches? 



















###### 7 









No one can redeem the life of another or give to God a ransom for them-- 



















###### 8 









the ransom for a life is costly, no payment is ever enough-- 



















###### 9 









so that they should live on forever and not see decay. 



















###### 10 









For all can see that the wise die, that the foolish and the senseless also perish, leaving their wealth to others. 



















###### 11 









Their tombs will remain their houses[^b] forever, their dwellings for endless generations, though they had[^c] named lands after themselves. 



















###### 12 









People, despite their wealth, do not endure; they are like the beasts that perish. 



















###### 13 









This is the fate of those who trust in themselves, and of their followers, who approve their sayings.[^d] 



















###### 14 









They are like sheep and are destined to die; death will be their shepherd (but the upright will prevail over them in the morning). Their forms will decay in the grave, far from their princely mansions. 



















###### 15 









But God will redeem me from the realm of the dead; he will surely take me to himself. 



















###### 16 









Do not be overawed when others grow rich, when the splendor of their houses increases; 



















###### 17 









for they will take nothing with them when they die, their splendor will not descend with them. 



















###### 18 









Though while they live they count themselves blessed-- and people praise you when you prosper-- 



















###### 19 









they will join those who have gone before them, who will never again see the light of life. 



















###### 20 









People who have wealth but lack understanding are like the beasts that perish. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

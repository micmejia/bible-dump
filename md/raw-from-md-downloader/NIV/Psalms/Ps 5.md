# Psalms 5

***




















###### 1 









Listen to my words, LORD, consider my lament. 



















###### 2 









Hear my cry for help, my King and my God, for to you I pray. 



















###### 3 









In the morning, LORD, you hear my voice; in the morning I lay my requests before you and wait expectantly. 



















###### 4 









For you are not a God who is pleased with wickedness; with you, evil people are not welcome. 



















###### 5 









The arrogant cannot stand in your presence. You hate all who do wrong; 



















###### 6 









you destroy those who tell lies. The bloodthirsty and deceitful you, LORD, detest. 



















###### 7 









But I, by your great love, can come into your house; in reverence I bow down toward your holy temple. 



















###### 8 









Lead me, LORD, in your righteousness because of my enemies-- make your way straight before me. 



















###### 9 









Not a word from their mouth can be trusted; their heart is filled with malice. Their throat is an open grave; with their tongues they tell lies. 



















###### 10 









Declare them guilty, O God! Let their intrigues be their downfall. Banish them for their many sins, for they have rebelled against you. 



















###### 11 









But let all who take refuge in you be glad; let them ever sing for joy. Spread your protection over them, that those who love your name may rejoice in you. 



















###### 12 









Surely, LORD, you bless the righteous; you surround them with your favor as with a shield. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

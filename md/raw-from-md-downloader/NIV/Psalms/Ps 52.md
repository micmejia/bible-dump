# Psalms 52

***




















###### 1 









Why do you boast of evil, you mighty hero? Why do you boast all day long, you who are a disgrace in the eyes of God? 



















###### 2 









You who practice deceit, your tongue plots destruction; it is like a sharpened razor. 



















###### 3 









You love evil rather than good, falsehood rather than speaking the truth.[^c] 



















###### 4 









You love every harmful word, you deceitful tongue! 



















###### 5

###### 6 









The righteous will see and fear; they will laugh at you, saying, 



















###### 7 









"Here now is the man who did not make God his stronghold but trusted in his great wealth and grew strong by destroying others!" 



















###### 8 









But I am like an olive tree flourishing in the house of God; I trust in God's unfailing love for ever and ever. 



















###### 9

# Psalms 53

***




















###### 1 









The fool says in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt, and their ways are vile; there is no one who does good. 



















###### 2 









God looks down from heaven on all mankind to see if there are any who understand, any who seek God. 



















###### 3 









Everyone has turned away, all have become corrupt; there is no one who does good, not even one. 



















###### 4 









Do all these evildoers know nothing? They devour my people as though eating bread; they never call on God. 



















###### 5 









But there they are, overwhelmed with dread, where there was nothing to dread. God scattered the bones of those who attacked you; you put them to shame, for God despised them. 



















###### 6

# Psalms 54

***




















###### 1 









Save me, O God, by your name; vindicate me by your might. 



















###### 2 









Hear my prayer, O God; listen to the words of my mouth. 



















###### 3 









Arrogant foes are attacking me; ruthless people are trying to kill me-- people without regard for God.[^c] 



















###### 4 









Surely God is my help; the Lord is the one who sustains me. 



















###### 5 









Let evil recoil on those who slander me; in your faithfulness destroy them. 



















###### 6 









I will sacrifice a freewill offering to you; I will praise your name, LORD, for it is good. 



















###### 7 









You have delivered me from all my troubles, and my eyes have looked in triumph on my foes. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

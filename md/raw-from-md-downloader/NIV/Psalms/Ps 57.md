# Psalms 57

***




















###### 1 









Have mercy on me, my God, have mercy on me, for in you I take refuge. I will take refuge in the shadow of your wings until the disaster has passed. 



















###### 2 









I cry out to God Most High, to God, who vindicates me. 



















###### 3 









He sends from heaven and saves me, rebuking those who hotly pursue me--[^c] God sends forth his love and his faithfulness. 



















###### 4 









I am in the midst of lions; I am forced to dwell among ravenous beasts-- men whose teeth are spears and arrows, whose tongues are sharp swords. 



















###### 5 









Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; let your glory be over all the earth. 



















###### 6 









They spread a net for my feet-- I was bowed down in distress. They dug a pit in my path-- but they have fallen into it themselves. 



















###### 7 









My heart, O God, is steadfast, my heart is steadfast; I will sing and make music. 



















###### 8 









Awake, my soul! Awake, harp and lyre! I will awaken the dawn. 



















###### 9 









I will praise you, Lord, among the nations; I will sing of you among the peoples. 



















###### 10 









For great is your love, reaching to the heavens; your faithfulness reaches to the skies. 



















###### 11

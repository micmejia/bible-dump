# Psalms 6

***




















###### 1 









LORD, do not rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your wrath. 



















###### 2 









Have mercy on me, LORD, for I am faint; heal me, LORD, for my bones are in agony. 



















###### 3 









My soul is in deep anguish. How long, LORD, how long? 



















###### 4 









Turn, LORD, and deliver me; save me because of your unfailing love. 



















###### 5 









Among the dead no one proclaims your name. Who praises you from the grave? 



















###### 6 









I am worn out from my groaning. All night long I flood my bed with weeping and drench my couch with tears. 



















###### 7 









My eyes grow weak with sorrow; they fail because of all my foes. 



















###### 8 









Away from me, all you who do evil, for the LORD has heard my weeping. 



















###### 9 









The LORD has heard my cry for mercy; the LORD accepts my prayer. 



















###### 10 









All my enemies will be overwhelmed with shame and anguish; they will turn back and suddenly be put to shame. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

# Psalms 61

***




















###### 1 









Hear my cry, O God; listen to my prayer. 



















###### 2 









From the ends of the earth I call to you, I call as my heart grows faint; lead me to the rock that is higher than I. 



















###### 3 









For you have been my refuge, a strong tower against the foe. 



















###### 4 









I long to dwell in your tent forever and take refuge in the shelter of your wings.[^b] 



















###### 5 









For you, God, have heard my vows; you have given me the heritage of those who fear your name. 



















###### 6 









Increase the days of the king's life, his years for many generations. 



















###### 7 









May he be enthroned in God's presence forever; appoint your love and faithfulness to protect him. 



















###### 8 









Then I will ever sing in praise of your name and fulfill my vows day after day. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

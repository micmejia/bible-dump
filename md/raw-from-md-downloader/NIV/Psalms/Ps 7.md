# Psalms 7

***




















###### 1 









LORD my God, I take refuge in you; save and deliver me from all who pursue me, 



















###### 2 









or they will tear me apart like a lion and rip me to pieces with no one to rescue me. 



















###### 3 









LORD my God, if I have done this and there is guilt on my hands-- 



















###### 4 









if I have repaid my ally with evil or without cause have robbed my foe-- 



















###### 5 









then let my enemy pursue and overtake me; let him trample my life to the ground and make me sleep in the dust.[^c] 



















###### 6 









Arise, LORD, in your anger; rise up against the rage of my enemies. Awake, my God; decree justice. 



















###### 7 









Let the assembled peoples gather around you, while you sit enthroned over them on high. 



















###### 8 









Let the LORD judge the peoples. Vindicate me, LORD, according to my righteousness, according to my integrity, O Most High. 



















###### 9 









Bring to an end the violence of the wicked and make the righteous secure-- you, the righteous God who probes minds and hearts. 



















###### 10 









My shield[^d] is God Most High, who saves the upright in heart. 



















###### 11 









God is a righteous judge, a God who displays his wrath every day. 



















###### 12 









If he does not relent, he[^e] will sharpen his sword; he will bend and string his bow. 



















###### 13 









He has prepared his deadly weapons; he makes ready his flaming arrows. 



















###### 14 









Whoever is pregnant with evil conceives trouble and gives birth to disillusionment. 



















###### 15 









Whoever digs a hole and scoops it out falls into the pit they have made. 



















###### 16 









The trouble they cause recoils on them; their violence comes down on their own heads. 



















###### 17 









I will give thanks to the LORD because of his righteousness; I will sing the praises of the name of the LORD Most High. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

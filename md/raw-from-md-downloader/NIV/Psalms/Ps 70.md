# Psalms 70

***




















###### 1 









Hasten, O God, to save me; come quickly, LORD, to help me. 



















###### 2 









May those who want to take my life be put to shame and confusion; may all who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace. 



















###### 3 









May those who say to me, "Aha! Aha!" turn back because of their shame. 



















###### 4 









But may all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; may those who long for your saving help always say, "The LORD is great!" 



















###### 5 









But as for me, I am poor and needy; come quickly to me, O God. You are my help and my deliverer; LORD, do not delay. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

# Psalms 76

***




















###### 1 









God is renowned in Judah; in Israel his name is great. 



















###### 2 









His tent is in Salem, his dwelling place in Zion. 



















###### 3 









There he broke the flashing arrows, the shields and the swords, the weapons of war.[^b] 



















###### 4 









You are radiant with light, more majestic than mountains rich with game. 



















###### 5 









The valiant lie plundered, they sleep their last sleep; not one of the warriors can lift his hands. 



















###### 6 









At your rebuke, God of Jacob, both horse and chariot lie still. 



















###### 7 









It is you alone who are to be feared. Who can stand before you when you are angry? 



















###### 8 









From heaven you pronounced judgment, and the land feared and was quiet-- 



















###### 9 









when you, God, rose up to judge, to save all the afflicted of the land. 



















###### 10 









Surely your wrath against mankind brings you praise, and the survivors of your wrath are restrained.[^c] 



















###### 11 









Make vows to the LORD your God and fulfill them; let all the neighboring lands bring gifts to the One to be feared. 



















###### 12 









He breaks the spirit of rulers; he is feared by the kings of the earth. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

# Psalms 77

***




















###### 1 









I cried out to God for help; I cried out to God to hear me. 



















###### 2 









When I was in distress, I sought the Lord; at night I stretched out untiring hands, and I would not be comforted. 



















###### 3 









I remembered you, God, and I groaned; I meditated, and my spirit grew faint.[^b] 



















###### 4 









You kept my eyes from closing; I was too troubled to speak. 



















###### 5 









I thought about the former days, the years of long ago; 



















###### 6 









I remembered my songs in the night. My heart meditated and my spirit asked: 



















###### 7 









"Will the Lord reject forever? Will he never show his favor again? 



















###### 8 









Has his unfailing love vanished forever? Has his promise failed for all time? 



















###### 9 









Has God forgotten to be merciful? Has he in anger withheld his compassion?" 



















###### 10 









Then I thought, "To this I will appeal: the years when the Most High stretched out his right hand. 



















###### 11 









I will remember the deeds of the LORD; yes, I will remember your miracles of long ago. 



















###### 12 









I will consider all your works and meditate on all your mighty deeds." 



















###### 13 









Your ways, God, are holy. What god is as great as our God? 



















###### 14 









You are the God who performs miracles; you display your power among the peoples. 



















###### 15 









With your mighty arm you redeemed your people, the descendants of Jacob and Joseph. 



















###### 16 









The waters saw you, God, the waters saw you and writhed; the very depths were convulsed. 



















###### 17 









The clouds poured down water, the heavens resounded with thunder; your arrows flashed back and forth. 



















###### 18 









Your thunder was heard in the whirlwind, your lightning lit up the world; the earth trembled and quaked. 



















###### 19 









Your path led through the sea, your way through the mighty waters, though your footprints were not seen. 



















###### 20 









You led your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

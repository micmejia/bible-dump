# Psalms 8

***




















###### 1 









LORD, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth! You have set your glory in the heavens. 



















###### 2 









Through the praise of children and infants you have established a stronghold against your enemies, to silence the foe and the avenger. 



















###### 3 









When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place, 



















###### 4 









what is mankind that you are mindful of them, human beings that you care for them?[^c] 



















###### 5 









You have made them[^d] a little lower than the angels[^e] and crowned them[^f] with glory and honor. 



















###### 6 









You made them rulers over the works of your hands; you put everything under their[^g] feet: 



















###### 7 









all flocks and herds, and the animals of the wild, 



















###### 8 









the birds in the sky, and the fish in the sea, all that swim the paths of the seas. 



















###### 9

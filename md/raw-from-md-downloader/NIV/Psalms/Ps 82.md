# Psalms 82

***




















###### 1 









God presides in the great assembly; he renders judgment among the "gods": 



















###### 2 









"How long will you[^a] defend the unjust and show partiality to the wicked?[^b] 



















###### 3 









Defend the weak and the fatherless; uphold the cause of the poor and the oppressed. 



















###### 4 









Rescue the weak and the needy; deliver them from the hand of the wicked. 



















###### 5 









"The 'gods' know nothing, they understand nothing. They walk about in darkness; all the foundations of the earth are shaken. 



















###### 6 









"I said, 'You are "gods"; you are all sons of the Most High.' 



















###### 7 









But you will die like mere mortals; you will fall like every other ruler." 



















###### 8

# Psalms 84

***




















###### 1 









How lovely is your dwelling place, LORD Almighty! 



















###### 2 









My soul yearns, even faints, for the courts of the LORD; my heart and my flesh cry out for the living God. 



















###### 3 









Even the sparrow has found a home, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may have her young-- a place near your altar, LORD Almighty, my King and my God. 



















###### 4 









Blessed are those who dwell in your house; they are ever praising you.[^c] 



















###### 5 









Blessed are those whose strength is in you, whose hearts are set on pilgrimage. 



















###### 6 









As they pass through the Valley of Baka, they make it a place of springs; the autumn rains also cover it with pools.[^d] 



















###### 7 









They go from strength to strength, till each appears before God in Zion. 



















###### 8 









Hear my prayer, LORD God Almighty; listen to me, God of Jacob. 



















###### 9 









Look on our shield,[^e] O God; look with favor on your anointed one. 



















###### 10 









Better is one day in your courts than a thousand elsewhere; I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of the wicked. 



















###### 11 









For the LORD God is a sun and shield; the LORD bestows favor and honor; no good thing does he withhold from those whose walk is blameless. 



















###### 12

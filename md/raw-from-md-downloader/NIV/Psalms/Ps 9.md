# Psalms 9

***




















###### 1 









I will give thanks to you, LORD, with all my heart; I will tell of all your wonderful deeds. 



















###### 2 









I will be glad and rejoice in you; I will sing the praises of your name, O Most High. 



















###### 3 









My enemies turn back; they stumble and perish before you. 



















###### 4 









For you have upheld my right and my cause, sitting enthroned as the righteous judge. 



















###### 5 









You have rebuked the nations and destroyed the wicked; you have blotted out their name for ever and ever. 



















###### 6 









Endless ruin has overtaken my enemies, you have uprooted their cities; even the memory of them has perished. 



















###### 7 









The LORD reigns forever; he has established his throne for judgment. 



















###### 8 









He rules the world in righteousness and judges the peoples with equity. 



















###### 9 









The LORD is a refuge for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble. 



















###### 10 









Those who know your name trust in you, for you, LORD, have never forsaken those who seek you. 



















###### 11 









Sing the praises of the LORD, enthroned in Zion; proclaim among the nations what he has done. 



















###### 12 









For he who avenges blood remembers; he does not ignore the cries of the afflicted. 



















###### 13 









LORD, see how my enemies persecute me! Have mercy and lift me up from the gates of death, 



















###### 14 









that I may declare your praises in the gates of Daughter Zion, and there rejoice in your salvation. 



















###### 15 









The nations have fallen into the pit they have dug; their feet are caught in the net they have hidden. 



















###### 16 









The LORD is known by his acts of justice; the wicked are ensnared by the work of their hands.[^c] 



















###### 17 









The wicked go down to the realm of the dead, all the nations that forget God. 



















###### 18 









But God will never forget the needy; the hope of the afflicted will never perish. 



















###### 19 









Arise, LORD, do not let mortals triumph; let the nations be judged in your presence. 



















###### 20 









Strike them with terror, LORD; let the nations know they are only mortal. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

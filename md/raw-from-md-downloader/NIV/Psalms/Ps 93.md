# Psalms 93

***




















###### 1 









The LORD reigns, he is robed in majesty; the LORD is robed in majesty and armed with strength; indeed, the world is established, firm and secure. 



















###### 2 









Your throne was established long ago; you are from all eternity. 



















###### 3 









The seas have lifted up, LORD, the seas have lifted up their voice; the seas have lifted up their pounding waves. 



















###### 4 









Mightier than the thunder of the great waters, mightier than the breakers of the sea-- the LORD on high is mighty. 



















###### 5 









Your statutes, LORD, stand firm; holiness adorns your house for endless days. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

# Psalms 96

***




















###### 1 









Sing to the LORD a new song; sing to the LORD, all the earth. 



















###### 2 









Sing to the LORD, praise his name; proclaim his salvation day after day. 



















###### 3 









Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous deeds among all peoples. 



















###### 4 









For great is the LORD and most worthy of praise; he is to be feared above all gods. 



















###### 5 









For all the gods of the nations are idols, but the LORD made the heavens. 



















###### 6 









Splendor and majesty are before him; strength and glory are in his sanctuary. 



















###### 7 









Ascribe to the LORD, all you families of nations, ascribe to the LORD glory and strength. 



















###### 8 









Ascribe to the LORD the glory due his name; bring an offering and come into his courts. 



















###### 9 









Worship the LORD in the splendor of his[^a] holiness; tremble before him, all the earth. 



















###### 10 









Say among the nations, "The LORD reigns." The world is firmly established, it cannot be moved; he will judge the peoples with equity. 



















###### 11 









Let the heavens rejoice, let the earth be glad; let the sea resound, and all that is in it. 



















###### 12 









Let the fields be jubilant, and everything in them; let all the trees of the forest sing for joy. 



















###### 13 









Let all creation rejoice before the LORD, for he comes, he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world in righteousness and the peoples in his faithfulness.

# Revelation 4

***




















###### 1 









After this I looked, and there before me was a door standing open in heaven. And the voice I had first heard speaking to me like a trumpet said, "Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after this." 



















###### 2 









At once I was in the Spirit, and there before me was a throne in heaven with someone sitting on it. 



















###### 3 









And the one who sat there had the appearance of jasper and ruby. A rainbow that shone like an emerald encircled the throne. 



















###### 4 









Surrounding the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and seated on them were twenty-four elders. They were dressed in white and had crowns of gold on their heads. 



















###### 5 









From the throne came flashes of lightning, rumblings and peals of thunder. In front of the throne, seven lamps were blazing. These are the seven spirits[^a] of God. 



















###### 6 









Also in front of the throne there was what looked like a sea of glass, clear as crystal. In the center, around the throne, were four living creatures, and they were covered with eyes, in front and in back. 



















###### 7 









The first living creature was like a lion, the second was like an ox, the third had a face like a man, the fourth was like a flying eagle. 



















###### 8 









Each of the four living creatures had six wings and was covered with eyes all around, even under its wings. Day and night they never stop saying: "'Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty,'[^b] who was, and is, and is to come." 



















###### 9 









Whenever the living creatures give glory, honor and thanks to him who sits on the throne and who lives for ever and ever, 



















###### 10 









the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne and worship him who lives for ever and ever. They lay their crowns before the throne and say: 



















###### 11

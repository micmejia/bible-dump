# Romans 11

***




















###### 1 









I ask then: Did God reject his people? By no means! I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin. 



















###### 2 









God did not reject his people, whom he foreknew. Don't you know what Scripture says in the passage about Elijah--how he appealed to God against Israel: 



















###### 3 









"Lord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars; I am the only one left, and they are trying to kill me"[^a]? 



















###### 4 









And what was God's answer to him? "I have reserved for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal."[^b] 



















###### 5 









So too, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace. 



















###### 6 









And if by grace, then it cannot be based on works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace. 



















###### 7 









What then? What the people of Israel sought so earnestly they did not obtain. The elect among them did, but the others were hardened, 



















###### 8 









as it is written: "God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that could not see and ears that could not hear, to this very day."[^c] 



















###### 9 









And David says: "May their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution for them. 



















###### 10 









May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, and their backs be bent forever."[^d] ## Ingrafted Branches 



















###### 11 









Again I ask: Did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery? Not at all! Rather, because of their transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel envious. 



















###### 12 









But if their transgression means riches for the world, and their loss means riches for the Gentiles, how much greater riches will their full inclusion bring! 



















###### 13 









I am talking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I take pride in my ministry 



















###### 14 









in the hope that I may somehow arouse my own people to envy and save some of them. 



















###### 15 









For if their rejection brought reconciliation to the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead? 



















###### 16 









If the part of the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, then the whole batch is holy; if the root is holy, so are the branches. 



















###### 17 









If some of the branches have been broken off, and you, though a wild olive shoot, have been grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing sap from the olive root, 



















###### 18 









do not consider yourself to be superior to those other branches. If you do, consider this: You do not support the root, but the root supports you. 



















###### 19 









You will say then, "Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in." 



















###### 20 









Granted. But they were broken off because of unbelief, and you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but tremble. 



















###### 21 









For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either. 



















###### 22 









Consider therefore the kindness and sternness of God: sternness to those who fell, but kindness to you, provided that you continue in his kindness. Otherwise, you also will be cut off. 



















###### 23 









And if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again. 



















###### 24 









After all, if you were cut out of an olive tree that is wild by nature, and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more readily will these, the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree! ## All Israel Will Be Saved 



















###### 25 









I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers and sisters, so that you may not be conceited: Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in, 



















###### 26 









and in this way[^e] all Israel will be saved. As it is written: "The deliverer will come from Zion; he will turn godlessness away from Jacob. 



















###### 27 









And this is[^f] my covenant with them when I take away their sins."[^g] 



















###### 28 









As far as the gospel is concerned, they are enemies for your sake; but as far as election is concerned, they are loved on account of the patriarchs, 



















###### 29 









for God's gifts and his call are irrevocable. 



















###### 30 









Just as you who were at one time disobedient to God have now received mercy as a result of their disobedience, 



















###### 31 









so they too have now become disobedient in order that they too may now[^h] receive mercy as a result of God's mercy to you. 



















###### 32 









For God has bound everyone over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all. ## Doxology 



















###### 33 









Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and[^i] knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out! 



















###### 34 









"Who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor?"[^j] 



















###### 35 









"Who has ever given to God, that God should repay them?"[^k] 



















###### 36 









For from him and through him and for him are all things. To him be the glory forever! Amen. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

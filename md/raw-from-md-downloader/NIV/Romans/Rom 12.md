# Romans 12

***




















###### 1 









Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God's mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God--this is your true and proper worship. 



















###### 2 









Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is--his good, pleasing and perfect will. ## Humble Service in the Body of Christ 



















###### 3 









For by the grace given me I say to every one of you: Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment, in accordance with the faith God has distributed to each of you. 



















###### 4 









For just as each of us has one body with many members, and these members do not all have the same function, 



















###### 5 









so in Christ we, though many, form one body, and each member belongs to all the others. 



















###### 6 









We have different gifts, according to the grace given to each of us. If your gift is prophesying, then prophesy in accordance with your[^a] faith; 



















###### 7 









if it is serving, then serve; if it is teaching, then teach; 



















###### 8 









if it is to encourage, then give encouragement; if it is giving, then give generously; if it is to lead,[^b] do it diligently; if it is to show mercy, do it cheerfully. ## Love in Action 



















###### 9 









Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good. 



















###### 10 









Be devoted to one another in love. Honor one another above yourselves. 



















###### 11 









Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervor, serving the Lord. 



















###### 12 









Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer. 



















###### 13 









Share with the Lord's people who are in need. Practice hospitality. 



















###### 14 









Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse. 



















###### 15 









Rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn with those who mourn. 



















###### 16 









Live in harmony with one another. Do not be proud, but be willing to associate with people of low position.[^c] Do not be conceited. 



















###### 17 









Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everyone. 



















###### 18 









If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone. 



















###### 19 









Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God's wrath, for it is written: "It is mine to avenge; I will repay,"[^d] says the Lord. 



















###### 20 









On the contrary: "If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head."[^e] 



















###### 21 









Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

# Romans 9

***




















###### 1 









I speak the truth in Christ--I am not lying, my conscience confirms it through the Holy Spirit-- 



















###### 2 









I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart. 



















###### 3 









For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my people, those of my own race, 



















###### 4 









the people of Israel. Theirs is the adoption to sonship; theirs the divine glory, the covenants, the receiving of the law, the temple worship and the promises. 



















###### 5 









Theirs are the patriarchs, and from them is traced the human ancestry of the Messiah, who is God over all, forever praised![^a] Amen. ## God's Sovereign Choice 



















###### 6 









It is not as though God's word had failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel. 



















###### 7 









Nor because they are his descendants are they all Abraham's children. On the contrary, "It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned."[^b] 



















###### 8 









In other words, it is not the children by physical descent who are God's children, but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as Abraham's offspring. 



















###### 9 









For this was how the promise was stated: "At the appointed time I will return, and Sarah will have a son."[^c] 



















###### 10 









Not only that, but Rebekah's children were conceived at the same time by our father Isaac. 



















###### 11 









Yet, before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad--in order that God's purpose in election might stand: 



















###### 12 









not by works but by him who calls--she was told, "The older will serve the younger."[^d] 



















###### 13 









Just as it is written: "Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated."[^e] 



















###### 14 









What then shall we say? Is God unjust? Not at all! 



















###### 15 









For he says to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion."[^f] 



















###### 16 









It does not, therefore, depend on human desire or effort, but on God's mercy. 



















###### 17 









For Scripture says to Pharaoh: "I raised you up for this very purpose, that I might display my power in you and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth."[^g] 



















###### 18 









Therefore God has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy, and he hardens whom he wants to harden. 



















###### 19 









One of you will say to me: "Then why does God still blame us? For who is able to resist his will?" 



















###### 20 









But who are you, a human being, to talk back to God? "Shall what is formed say to the one who formed it, 'Why did you make me like this?'"[^h] 



















###### 21 









Does not the potter have the right to make out of the same lump of clay some pottery for special purposes and some for common use? 



















###### 22 









What if God, although choosing to show his wrath and make his power known, bore with great patience the objects of his wrath--prepared for destruction? 



















###### 23 









What if he did this to make the riches of his glory known to the objects of his mercy, whom he prepared in advance for glory-- 



















###### 24 









even us, whom he also called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles? 



















###### 25 









As he says in Hosea: "I will call them 'my people' who are not my people; and I will call her 'my loved one' who is not my loved one,"[^i] 



















###### 26 









and, "In the very place where it was said to them, 'You are not my people,' there they will be called 'children of the living God.'"[^j] 



















###### 27 









Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: "Though the number of the Israelites be like the sand by the sea, only the remnant will be saved. 



















###### 28 









For the Lord will carry out his sentence on earth with speed and finality."[^k] 



















###### 29 









It is just as Isaiah said previously: "Unless the Lord Almighty had left us descendants, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah."[^l] ## Israel's Unbelief 



















###### 30 









What then shall we say? That the Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have obtained it, a righteousness that is by faith; 



















###### 31 









but the people of Israel, who pursued the law as the way of righteousness, have not attained their goal. 



















###### 32 









Why not? Because they pursued it not by faith but as if it were by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone. 



















###### 33 









As it is written: "See, I lay in Zion a stone that causes people to stumble and a rock that makes them fall, and the one who believes in him will never be put to shame."[^m] NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

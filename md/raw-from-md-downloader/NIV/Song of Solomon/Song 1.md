# Song of Solomon 1

***




















###### 1 









Solomon's Song of Songs. 



















###### 2 









Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth-- for your love is more delightful than wine. 



















###### 3 









Pleasing is the fragrance of your perfumes; your name is like perfume poured out. No wonder the young women love you! 



















###### 4 









Take me away with you--let us hurry! Let the king bring me into his chambers. We rejoice and delight in you[^b]; we will praise your love more than wine. How right they are to adore you! 



















###### 5 









Dark am I, yet lovely, daughters of Jerusalem, dark like the tents of Kedar, like the tent curtains of Solomon.[^c] 



















###### 6 









Do not stare at me because I am dark, because I am darkened by the sun. My mother's sons were angry with me and made me take care of the vineyards; my own vineyard I had to neglect. 



















###### 7 









Tell me, you whom I love, where you graze your flock and where you rest your sheep at midday. Why should I be like a veiled woman beside the flocks of your friends? 



















###### 8 









If you do not know, most beautiful of women, follow the tracks of the sheep and graze your young goats by the tents of the shepherds. 



















###### 9 









I liken you, my darling, to a mare among Pharaoh's chariot horses. 



















###### 10 









Your cheeks are beautiful with earrings, your neck with strings of jewels. 



















###### 11 









We will make you earrings of gold, studded with silver. 



















###### 12 









While the king was at his table, my perfume spread its fragrance. 



















###### 13 









My beloved is to me a sachet of myrrh resting between my breasts. 



















###### 14 









My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms from the vineyards of En Gedi. 



















###### 15 









How beautiful you are, my darling! Oh, how beautiful! Your eyes are doves. 



















###### 16 









How handsome you are, my beloved! Oh, how charming! And our bed is verdant. 



















###### 17

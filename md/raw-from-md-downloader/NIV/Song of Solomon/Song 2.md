# Song of Solomon 2

***




















###### 1 









I am a rose[^b] of Sharon, a lily of the valleys. 



















###### 2 









Like a lily among thorns is my darling among the young women. 



















###### 3 









Like an apple[^c] tree among the trees of the forest is my beloved among the young men. I delight to sit in his shade, and his fruit is sweet to my taste. 



















###### 4 









Let him lead me to the banquet hall, and let his banner over me be love. 



















###### 5 









Strengthen me with raisins, refresh me with apples, for I am faint with love. 



















###### 6 









His left arm is under my head, and his right arm embraces me. 



















###### 7 









Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you by the gazelles and by the does of the field: Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires. 



















###### 8 









Listen! My beloved! Look! Here he comes, leaping across the mountains, bounding over the hills. 



















###### 9 









My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag. Look! There he stands behind our wall, gazing through the windows, peering through the lattice. 



















###### 10 









My beloved spoke and said to me, "Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, come with me. 



















###### 11 









See! The winter is past; the rains are over and gone. 



















###### 12 









Flowers appear on the earth; the season of singing has come, the cooing of doves is heard in our land. 



















###### 13 









The fig tree forms its early fruit; the blossoming vines spread their fragrance. Arise, come, my darling; my beautiful one, come with me." 



















###### 14 









My dove in the clefts of the rock, in the hiding places on the mountainside, show me your face, let me hear your voice; for your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely. 



















###### 15 









Catch for us the foxes, the little foxes that ruin the vineyards, our vineyards that are in bloom. 



















###### 16 









My beloved is mine and I am his; he browses among the lilies. 



















###### 17 









Until the day breaks and the shadows flee, turn, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or like a young stag on the rugged hills.[^d] NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

# Song of Solomon 3

***




















###### 1 









All night long on my bed I looked for the one my heart loves; I looked for him but did not find him. 



















###### 2 









I will get up now and go about the city, through its streets and squares; I will search for the one my heart loves. So I looked for him but did not find him. 



















###### 3 









The watchmen found me as they made their rounds in the city. "Have you seen the one my heart loves?" 



















###### 4 









Scarcely had I passed them when I found the one my heart loves. I held him and would not let him go till I had brought him to my mother's house, to the room of the one who conceived me. 



















###### 5 









Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you by the gazelles and by the does of the field: Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires. 



















###### 6 









Who is this coming up from the wilderness like a column of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and incense made from all the spices of the merchant? 



















###### 7 









Look! It is Solomon's carriage, escorted by sixty warriors, the noblest of Israel, 



















###### 8 









all of them wearing the sword, all experienced in battle, each with his sword at his side, prepared for the terrors of the night. 



















###### 9 









King Solomon made for himself the carriage; he made it of wood from Lebanon. 



















###### 10 









Its posts he made of silver, its base of gold. Its seat was upholstered with purple, its interior inlaid with love. Daughters of Jerusalem, <sup class="versenum mid-line">11</sup>come out, and look, you daughters of Zion. Look[^a] on King Solomon wearing a crown, the crown with which his mother crowned him on the day of his wedding, the day his heart rejoiced.

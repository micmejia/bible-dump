# Song of Solomon 5

***




















###### 1 









I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride; I have gathered my myrrh with my spice. I have eaten my honeycomb and my honey; I have drunk my wine and my milk. Eat, friends, and drink; drink your fill of love. 



















###### 2 









I slept but my heart was awake. Listen! My beloved is knocking: "Open to me, my sister, my darling, my dove, my flawless one. My head is drenched with dew, my hair with the dampness of the night." 



















###### 3 









I have taken off my robe-- must I put it on again? I have washed my feet-- must I soil them again? 



















###### 4 









My beloved thrust his hand through the latch-opening; my heart began to pound for him. 



















###### 5 









I arose to open for my beloved, and my hands dripped with myrrh, my fingers with flowing myrrh, on the handles of the bolt. 



















###### 6 









I opened for my beloved, but my beloved had left; he was gone. My heart sank at his departure.[^a] I looked for him but did not find him. I called him but he did not answer. 



















###### 7 









The watchmen found me as they made their rounds in the city. They beat me, they bruised me; they took away my cloak, those watchmen of the walls! 



















###### 8 









Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you-- if you find my beloved, what will you tell him? Tell him I am faint with love. 



















###### 9 









How is your beloved better than others, most beautiful of women? How is your beloved better than others, that you so charge us? 



















###### 10 









My beloved is radiant and ruddy, outstanding among ten thousand. 



















###### 11 









His head is purest gold; his hair is wavy and black as a raven. 



















###### 12 









His eyes are like doves by the water streams, washed in milk, mounted like jewels. 



















###### 13 









His cheeks are like beds of spice yielding perfume. His lips are like lilies dripping with myrrh. 



















###### 14 









His arms are rods of gold set with topaz. His body is like polished ivory decorated with lapis lazuli. 



















###### 15 









His legs are pillars of marble set on bases of pure gold. His appearance is like Lebanon, choice as its cedars. 



















###### 16 









His mouth is sweetness itself; he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, this is my friend, daughters of Jerusalem. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

# Song of Solomon 8

***




















###### 1 









If only you were to me like a brother, who was nursed at my mother's breasts! Then, if I found you outside, I would kiss you, and no one would despise me. 



















###### 2 









I would lead you and bring you to my mother's house-- she who has taught me. I would give you spiced wine to drink, the nectar of my pomegranates. 



















###### 3 









His left arm is under my head and his right arm embraces me. 



















###### 4 









Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you: Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires. 



















###### 5 









Who is this coming up from the wilderness leaning on her beloved? Under the apple tree I roused you; there your mother conceived you, there she who was in labor gave you birth. 



















###### 6 









Place me like a seal over your heart, like a seal on your arm; for love is as strong as death, its jealousy[^a] unyielding as the grave. It burns like blazing fire, like a mighty flame.[^b] 



















###### 7 









Many waters cannot quench love; rivers cannot sweep it away. If one were to give all the wealth of one's house for love, it[^c] would be utterly scorned. 



















###### 8 









We have a little sister, and her breasts are not yet grown. What shall we do for our sister on the day she is spoken for? 



















###### 9 









If she is a wall, we will build towers of silver on her. If she is a door, we will enclose her with panels of cedar. 



















###### 10 









I am a wall, and my breasts are like towers. Thus I have become in his eyes like one bringing contentment. 



















###### 11 









Solomon had a vineyard in Baal Hamon; he let out his vineyard to tenants. Each was to bring for its fruit a thousand shekels[^d] of silver. 



















###### 12 









But my own vineyard is mine to give; the thousand shekels are for you, Solomon, and two hundred[^e] are for those who tend its fruit. 



















###### 13 









You who dwell in the gardens with friends in attendance, let me hear your voice! 



















###### 14 









Come away, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or like a young stag on the spice-laden mountains. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

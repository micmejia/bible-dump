# Titus 1

***




















###### 1 









Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ to further the faith of God's elect and their knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness-- 



















###### 2 









in the hope of eternal life, which God, who does not lie, promised before the beginning of time, 



















###### 3 









and which now at his appointed season he has brought to light through the preaching entrusted to me by the command of God our Savior, 



















###### 4 









To Titus, my true son in our common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior. ## Appointing Elders Who Love What Is Good 



















###### 5 









The reason I left you in Crete was that you might put in order what was left unfinished and appoint[^a] elders in every town, as I directed you. 



















###### 6 









An elder must be blameless, faithful to his wife, a man whose children believe[^b] and are not open to the charge of being wild and disobedient. 



















###### 7 









Since an overseer manages God's household, he must be blameless--not overbearing, not quick-tempered, not given to drunkenness, not violent, not pursuing dishonest gain. 



















###### 8 









Rather, he must be hospitable, one who loves what is good, who is self-controlled, upright, holy and disciplined. 



















###### 9 









He must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught, so that he can encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it. ## Rebuking Those Who Fail to Do Good 



















###### 10 









For there are many rebellious people, full of meaningless talk and deception, especially those of the circumcision group. 



















###### 11 









They must be silenced, because they are disrupting whole households by teaching things they ought not to teach--and that for the sake of dishonest gain. 



















###### 12 









One of Crete's own prophets has said it: "Cretans are always liars, evil brutes, lazy gluttons."[^c] 



















###### 13 









This saying is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, so that they will be sound in the faith 



















###### 14 









and will pay no attention to Jewish myths or to the merely human commands of those who reject the truth. 



















###### 15 









To the pure, all things are pure, but to those who are corrupted and do not believe, nothing is pure. In fact, both their minds and consciences are corrupted. 



















###### 16 









They claim to know God, but by their actions they deny him. They are detestable, disobedient and unfit for doing anything good. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

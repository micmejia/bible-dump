# Zechariah 4

***




















###### 1 









Then the angel who talked with me returned and woke me up, like someone awakened from sleep. 



















###### 2 









He asked me, "What do you see?" I answered, "I see a solid gold lampstand with a bowl at the top and seven lamps on it, with seven channels to the lamps. 



















###### 3 









Also there are two olive trees by it, one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left." 



















###### 4 









I asked the angel who talked with me, "What are these, my lord?" 



















###### 5 









He answered, "Do you not know what these are?" "No, my lord," I replied. 



















###### 6 









So he said to me, "This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel: 'Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit,' says the LORD Almighty. 



















###### 7 









"What are you, mighty mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become level ground. Then he will bring out the capstone to shouts of 'God bless it! God bless it!'" 



















###### 8 









Then the word of the LORD came to me: 



















###### 9 









"The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this temple; his hands will also complete it. Then you will know that the LORD Almighty has sent me to you. 



















###### 10 









"Who dares despise the day of small things, since the seven eyes of the LORD that range throughout the earth will rejoice when they see the chosen capstone[^a] in the hand of Zerubbabel?" 



















###### 11 









Then I asked the angel, "What are these two olive trees on the right and the left of the lampstand?" 



















###### 12 









Again I asked him, "What are these two olive branches beside the two gold pipes that pour out golden oil?" 



















###### 13 









He replied, "Do you not know what these are?" "No, my lord," I said. 



















###### 14 









So he said, "These are the two who are anointed to[^b] serve the Lord of all the earth." NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek.

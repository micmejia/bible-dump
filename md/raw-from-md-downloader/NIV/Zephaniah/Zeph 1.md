###### 3

###### 4 









"I will stretch out my hand against Judah and against all who live in Jerusalem. I will destroy every remnant of Baal worship in this place, the very names of the idolatrous priests--

those who bow down on the roofs to worship the starry host, those who bow down and swear by the LORD and who also swear by Molek,[^b] 



















###### 6

###### 16 









a day of trumpet and battle cry against the fortified cities and against the corner towers. 



















###### 17

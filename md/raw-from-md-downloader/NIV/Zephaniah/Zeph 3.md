# Zephaniah 3

***




















###### 1 









Woe to the city of oppressors, rebellious and defiled! 



















###### 2 









She obeys no one, she accepts no correction. She does not trust in the LORD, she does not draw near to her God. 



















###### 3 









Her officials within her are roaring lions; her rulers are evening wolves, who leave nothing for the morning. 



















###### 4 









Her prophets are unprincipled; they are treacherous people. Her priests profane the sanctuary and do violence to the law. 



















###### 5 









The LORD within her is righteous; he does no wrong. Morning by morning he dispenses his justice, and every new day he does not fail, yet the unrighteous know no shame. 



















###### 6 









"I have destroyed nations; their strongholds are demolished. I have left their streets deserted, with no one passing through. Their cities are laid waste; they are deserted and empty. 



















###### 7 









Of Jerusalem I thought, 'Surely you will fear me and accept correction!' Then her place of refuge[^a] would not be destroyed, nor all my punishments come upon[^b] her. But they were still eager to act corruptly in all they did. 



















###### 8 









Therefore wait for me," declares the LORD, "for the day I will stand up to testify.[^c] I have decided to assemble the nations, to gather the kingdoms and to pour out my wrath on them-- all my fierce anger. The whole world will be consumed by the fire of my jealous anger. ## Restoration of Israel's Remnant 



















###### 9 









"Then I will purify the lips of the peoples, that all of them may call on the name of the LORD and serve him shoulder to shoulder. 



















###### 10 









From beyond the rivers of Cush[^d] my worshipers, my scattered people, will bring me offerings. 



















###### 11 









On that day you, Jerusalem, will not be put to shame for all the wrongs you have done to me, because I will remove from you your arrogant boasters. Never again will you be haughty on my holy hill. 



















###### 12 









But I will leave within you the meek and humble. The remnant of Israel will trust in the name of the LORD. 



















###### 13 









They will do no wrong; they will tell no lies. A deceitful tongue will not be found in their mouths. They will eat and lie down and no one will make them afraid." 



















###### 14 









Sing, Daughter Zion; shout aloud, Israel! Be glad and rejoice with all your heart, Daughter Jerusalem! 



















###### 15 









The LORD has taken away your punishment, he has turned back your enemy. The LORD, the King of Israel, is with you; never again will you fear any harm. 



















###### 16 









On that day they will say to Jerusalem, "Do not fear, Zion; do not let your hands hang limp. 



















###### 17 









The LORD your God is with you, the Mighty Warrior who saves. He will take great delight in you; in his love he will no longer rebuke you, but will rejoice over you with singing." 



















###### 18 









"I will remove from you all who mourn over the loss of your appointed festivals, which is a burden and reproach for you. 



















###### 19 









At that time I will deal with all who oppressed you. I will rescue the lame; I will gather the exiles. I will give them praise and honor in every land where they have suffered shame. 



















###### 20 









At that time I will gather you; at that time I will bring you home. I will give you honor and praise among all the peoples of the earth when I restore your fortunes[^e] before your very eyes," says the LORD.

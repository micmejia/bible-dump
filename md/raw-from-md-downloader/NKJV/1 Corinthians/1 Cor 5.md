# 1 Corinthians 5

***


###### 1 
It is actually reported _that there is_ sexual immorality among you, and such sexual immorality as is not even [^a]named among the Gentiles--that a man has his father's wife! 

###### 2 
And you are [^b]puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he who has done this deed might be taken away from among you. 

###### 3 
For I indeed, as absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged (as though I were present) him who has so done this deed. 

###### 4 
In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together, along with my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, 

###### 5 
deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord [^c]Jesus. 

###### 6 
Your glorying _is_ not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump? 

###### 7 
Therefore [^d]purge out the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, since you truly are unleavened. For indeed Christ, our Passover, was sacrificed [^e]for us. 

###### 8 
Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened _bread_ of sincerity and truth. ## Immorality Must Be Judged 

###### 9 
I wrote to you in my epistle not to [^f]keep company with sexually immoral people. 

###### 10 
Yet _I_ certainly _did_ not _mean_ with the sexually immoral people of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or idolaters, since then you would need to go out of the world. 

###### 11 
But now I have written to you not to keep company with anyone named a brother, who is sexually immoral, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner--not even to eat with such a person. 

###### 12 
For what _have_ I _to do_ with judging those also who are outside? Do you not judge those who are inside? 

###### 13 
But those who are outside God judges. Therefore "put away from yourselves the evil person." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# 1 Corinthians 9

***


###### 1 
Am I not an apostle? Am I not free? Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord? 

###### 2 
If I am not an apostle to others, yet doubtless I am to you. For you are the [^a]seal of my apostleship in the Lord. 

###### 3 
My defense to those who examine me is this: 

###### 4 
Do we have no [^b]right to eat and drink? 

###### 5 
Do we have no right to take along [^c]a believing wife, as _do_ also the other apostles, the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas? 

###### 6 
Or _is it_ only Barnabas and I _who_ have no right to refrain from working? 

###### 7 
Who ever goes to war at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its fruit? Or who tends a flock and does not drink of the milk of the flock? 

###### 8 
Do I say these things as a _mere_ man? Or does not the law say the same also? 

###### 9 
For it is written in the law of Moses, "You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain." Is it oxen God is concerned about? 

###### 10 
Or does He say _it_ altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, _this_ is written, that he who plows should plow in hope, and he who threshes in hope should be partaker of his hope. 

###### 11 
If we have sown spiritual things for you, _is it_ a great thing if we reap your material things? 

###### 12 
If others are partakers of _this_ right over you, _are_ we not even more? Nevertheless we have not used this right, but endure all things lest we hinder the gospel of Christ. 

###### 13 
Do you not know that those who minister the holy things eat _of the things_ of the temple, and those who serve at the altar partake of _the offerings of_ the altar? 

###### 14 
Even so the Lord has commanded that those who preach the gospel should live from the gospel. 

###### 15 
But I have used none of these things, nor have I written these things that it should be done so to me; for it _would be_ better for me to die than that anyone should make my boasting void. 

###### 16 
For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to boast of, for necessity is laid upon me; yes, woe is me if I do not preach the gospel! 

###### 17 
For if I do this willingly, I have a reward; but if against my will, I have been entrusted with a stewardship. 

###### 18 
What is my reward then? That when I preach the gospel, I may present the gospel [^d]of Christ without charge, that I may not abuse my authority in the gospel. ## Serving All Men 

###### 19 
For though I am free from all _men,_ I have made myself a servant to all, that I might win the more; 

###### 20 
and to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might win Jews; to those _who are_ under the law, as under the [^e]law, that I might win those _who are_ under the law; 

###### 21 
to those _who are_ without law, as without law (not being without [^f]law toward God, but under [^g]law toward Christ), that I might win those _who are_ without law; 

###### 22 
to the weak I became [^h]as weak, that I might win the weak. I have become all things to all _men,_ that I might by all means save some. 

###### 23 
Now this I do for the gospel's sake, that I may be partaker of it with _you._ ## Striving for a Crown 

###### 24 
Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may [^i]obtain _it._ 

###### 25 
And everyone who competes _for the prize_ [^j]is temperate in all things. Now they _do it_ to obtain a perishable crown, but we _for_ an imperishable _crown._ 

###### 26 
Therefore I run thus: not with uncertainty. Thus I fight: not as _one who_ beats the air. 

###### 27 
But I discipline my body and bring _it_ into subjection, lest, when I have preached to others, I myself should become disqualified. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

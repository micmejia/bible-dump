# 1 Kings 5

***


###### 1 
Now Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon, because he heard that they had anointed him king in place of his father, for Hiram had always loved David. 

###### 2 
Then Solomon sent to Hiram, saying: 

###### 3 
You know how my father David could not build a house for the name of the Lord his God because of the wars which were fought against him on every side, until the Lord put [^a]_his foes_ under the soles of his feet. 

###### 4 
But now the Lord my God has given me rest[^b] on every side; _there is_ neither adversary nor [^c]evil occurrence. 

###### 5 
And behold, [^d]I propose to build a house for the name of the Lord my God, as the Lord spoke to my father David, saying, "Your son, whom I will set on your throne in your place, he shall build the house for My name." 

###### 6 
Now therefore, command that they cut down cedars for me from Lebanon; and my servants will be with your servants, and I will pay you wages for your servants according to whatever you say. For you know _there is_ none among us who has skill to cut timber like the Sidonians. 

###### 7 
So it was, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly and said, Blessed _be_ the Lord this day, for He has given David a wise son over this great people! 

###### 8 
Then Hiram sent to Solomon, saying: I have considered _the message_ which you sent me, _and_ I will do all you desire concerning the cedar and cypress logs. 

###### 9 
My servants shall bring _them_ down from Lebanon to the sea; I will float them in rafts by sea to the place you indicate to me, and will have them broken apart there; then you can take _them_ away. And you shall fulfill my desire by giving food for my household. 

###### 10 
Then Hiram gave Solomon cedar and cypress logs _according to_ all his desire. 

###### 11 
And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand [^e]kors of wheat _as_ food for his household, and [^f]twenty kors of pressed oil. Thus Solomon gave to Hiram year by year. 

###### 12 
So the Lord gave Solomon wisdom, as He had promised him; and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and the two of them made a treaty together. 

###### 13 
Then King Solomon raised up a labor force out of all Israel; and the labor force was thirty thousand men. 

###### 14 
And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month in shifts: they were one month in Lebanon _and_ two months at home; Adoniram _was_ in charge of the labor force. 

###### 15 
Solomon had seventy thousand who carried burdens, and eighty thousand who quarried _stone_ in the mountains, 

###### 16 
besides three thousand [^g]three hundred from the chiefs of Solomon's deputies, who supervised the people who labored in the work. 

###### 17 
And the king commanded them to quarry large stones, costly stones, _and_ hewn stones, to lay the foundation of the [^h]temple. 

###### 18 
So Solomon's builders, Hiram's builders, and the Gebalites quarried _them;_ and they prepared timber and stones to build the [^i]temple. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

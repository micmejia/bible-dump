# 1 Thessalonians 2

***


###### 1 
For you yourselves know, brethren, that our coming to you was not in vain. 

###### 2 
But [^a]even after we had suffered before and were spitefully treated at Philippi, as you know, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God in much conflict. 

###### 3 
For our exhortation _did_ not _come_ from error or uncleanness, nor _was it_ in deceit. 

###### 4 
But as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, even so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God who tests our hearts. 

###### 5 
For neither at any time did we use flattering words, as you know, nor a [^b]cloak for covetousness--God _is_ witness. 

###### 6 
Nor did we seek glory from men, either from you or from others, when we might have made demands as apostles of Christ. 

###### 7 
But we were gentle among you, just as a nursing _mother_ cherishes her own children. 

###### 8 
So, affectionately longing for you, we were well pleased to impart to you not only the gospel of God, but also our own lives, because you had become dear to us. 

###### 9 
For you remember, brethren, our labor and toil; for laboring night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you, we preached to you the gospel of God. 

###### 10 
You _are_ witnesses, and God _also,_ how devoutly and justly and blamelessly we behaved ourselves among you who believe; 

###### 11 
as you know how we exhorted, and comforted, and [^c]charged every one of you, as a father _does_ his own children, 

###### 12 
that you would walk worthy of God who calls you into His own kingdom and glory. ## Their Conversion 

###### 13 
For this reason we also thank God without ceasing, because when you received the word of God which you heard from us, you welcomed _it_ not _as_ the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which also effectively works in you who believe. 

###### 14 
For you, brethren, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus. For you also suffered the same things from your own countrymen, just as they _did_ from the Judeans, 

###### 15 
who killed both the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they do not please God and are [^d]contrary to all men, 

###### 16 
forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved, so as always to fill up _the measure of_ their sins; but wrath has come upon them to the uttermost. ## Longing to See Them 

###### 17 
But we, brethren, having been taken away from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavored more eagerly to see your face with great desire. 

###### 18 
Therefore we wanted to come to you--even I, Paul, time and again--but Satan hindered us. 

###### 19 
For what _is_ our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? _Is it_ not even you in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at His coming? 

###### 20 
For you are our glory and joy. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

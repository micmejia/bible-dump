# 2 Corinthians 6

***


###### 1 
We then, _as_ workers together _with Him_ also plead with _you_ not to receive the grace of God in vain. 

###### 2 
For He says: "In an acceptable time I have heard you, And in the day of salvation I have helped you." Behold, now _is_ the accepted time; behold, now _is_ the day of salvation. 

###### 3 
We give no offense in anything, that our ministry may not be blamed. 

###### 4 
But in all _things_ we commend ourselves as ministers of God: in much [^a]patience, in tribulations, in needs, in distresses, 

###### 5 
in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in sleeplessness, in fastings; 

###### 6 
by purity, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Spirit, by [^b]sincere love, 

###### 7 
by the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, 

###### 8 
by honor and dishonor, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and _yet_ true; 

###### 9 
as unknown, and _yet_ well known; as dying, and behold we live; as chastened, and _yet_ not killed; 

###### 10 
as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and _yet_ possessing all things. ## Be Holy 

###### 11 
O Corinthians! [^c]We have spoken openly to you, our heart is wide open. 

###### 12 
You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted by your _own_ affections. 

###### 13 
Now in return for the same (I speak as to children), you also be open. 

###### 14 
Do not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers. For what [^d]fellowship has righteousness with lawlessness? And what [^e]communion has light with darkness? 

###### 15 
And what accord has Christ with Belial? Or what part has a believer with an unbeliever? 

###### 16 
And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For you[^f] are the temple of the living God. As God has said: "I will dwell in them And walk among _them._ I will be their God, And they shall be My people." 

###### 17 
Therefore "Come out from among them And be separate, says the Lord. Do not touch what is unclean, And I will receive you." 

###### 18 
"I will be a Father to you, And you shall be My sons and daughters, Says the Lord Almighty." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

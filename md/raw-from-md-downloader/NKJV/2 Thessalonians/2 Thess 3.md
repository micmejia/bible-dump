# 2 Thessalonians 3

***


###### 1 
Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may run _swiftly_ and be glorified, just as _it is_ with you, 

###### 2 
and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men; for not all have faith. 

###### 3 
But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you and guard _you_ from the evil one. 

###### 4 
And we have confidence in the Lord concerning you, both that you do and will do the things we command you. 

###### 5 
Now may the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the patience of Christ. ## Warning Against Idleness 

###### 6 
But we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw from every brother who walks disorderly and not according to the tradition which [^a]he received from us. 

###### 7 
For you yourselves know how you ought to follow us, for we were not disorderly among you; 

###### 8 
nor did we eat anyone's bread [^b]free of charge, but worked with labor and toil night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you, 

###### 9 
not because we do not have authority, but to make ourselves an example of how you should follow us. 

###### 10 
For even when we were with you, we commanded you this: If anyone will not work, neither shall he eat. 

###### 11 
For we hear that there are some who walk among you in a disorderly manner, not working at all, but are busybodies. 

###### 12 
Now those who are such we command and [^c]exhort through our Lord Jesus Christ that they work in quietness and eat their own bread. 

###### 13 
But _as for_ you, brethren, do not grow weary _in_ doing good. 

###### 14 
And if anyone does not obey our word in this [^d]epistle, note that person and do not keep company with him, that he may be ashamed. 

###### 15 
Yet do not count _him_ as an enemy, but [^e]admonish _him_ as a brother. ## Benediction 

###### 16 
Now may the Lord of peace Himself give you peace always in every way. The Lord _be_ with you all. 

###### 17 
The salutation of Paul with my own hand, which is a sign in every [^f]epistle; so I write. 

###### 18 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ _be_ with you all. Amen. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Amos 3

***


###### 1 
Hear this word that the Lord has spoken against you, O children of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt, saying: 

###### 2 
"You only have I known of all the families of the earth; Therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities." 

###### 3 
Can two walk together, unless they are agreed? 

###### 4 
Will a lion roar in the forest, when he has no prey? Will a young lion [^a]cry out of his den, if he has caught nothing? 

###### 5 
Will a bird fall into a snare on the earth, where there is no [^b]trap for it? Will a snare spring up from the earth, if it has caught nothing at all? 

###### 6 
If a [^c]trumpet is blown in a city, will not the people be afraid? If there is calamity in a city, will not the Lord have done _it?_ 

###### 7 
Surely the Lord God does nothing, Unless He reveals His secret to His servants the prophets. 

###### 8 
A lion has roared! Who will not fear? The Lord God has spoken! Who can but prophesy? ## Punishment of Israel's Sins 

###### 9 
"Proclaim in the palaces at [^d]Ashdod, And in the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say: 'Assemble on the mountains of Samaria; See great tumults in her midst, And the [^e]oppressed within her. 

###### 10 
For they do not know to do right,' Says the Lord, 'Who store up violence and [^f]robbery in their palaces.' " 

###### 11 
Therefore thus says the Lord God: "An adversary _shall be_ all around the land; He shall sap your strength from you, And your palaces shall be plundered." 

###### 12 
Thus says the Lord: "As a shepherd [^g]takes from the mouth of a lion Two legs or a piece of an ear, So shall the children of Israel be taken out Who dwell in Samaria-- In the corner of a bed and [^h]on the edge of a couch! 

###### 13 
Hear and testify against the house of Jacob," Says the Lord God, the God of hosts, 

###### 14 
"That in the day I punish Israel for their transgressions, I will also visit _destruction_ on the altars of Bethel; And the horns of the altar shall be cut off And fall to the ground. 

###### 15 
I will [^i]destroy the winter house along with the summer house; The houses of ivory shall perish, And the great houses shall have an end," Says the Lord. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

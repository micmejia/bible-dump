# Amos 6

***


###### 1 
Woe to you _who are_ at ease in Zion, And trust in Mount Samaria, Notable persons in the chief nation, To whom the house of Israel comes! 

###### 2 
Go over to Calneh and see; And from there go to Hamath the great; Then go down to Gath of the Philistines. _Are you_ better than these kingdoms? Or is their territory greater than your territory? 

###### 3 
_Woe to_ you who put far off the day of doom, Who cause the seat of violence to come near; 

###### 4 
Who lie on beds of ivory, Stretch out on your couches, Eat lambs from the flock And calves from the midst of the stall; 

###### 5 
Who sing idly to the sound of stringed instruments, _And_ invent for yourselves musical instruments like David; 

###### 6 
Who drink wine from bowls, And anoint yourselves with the best ointments, But are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph. 

###### 7 
Therefore they shall now go captive as the first of the captives, And those who recline at banquets shall be removed. 

###### 8 
The Lord God has sworn by Himself, The Lord God of hosts says: "I abhor the pride of Jacob, And hate his palaces; Therefore I will deliver up _the_ city And all that is in it." 

###### 9 
Then it shall come to pass, that if ten men remain in one house, they shall die. 

###### 10 
And when [^a]a relative _of the dead,_ with one who will burn _the bodies,_ picks up the [^b]bodies to take them out of the house, he will say to one inside the house, "_Are there_ any more with you?" Then someone will say, "None." And he will say, "Hold your tongue! For we dare not mention the name of the Lord." 

###### 11 
For behold, the Lord gives a command: He will break the great house into bits, And the little house into pieces. 

###### 12 
Do horses run on rocks? Does _one_ plow _there_ with oxen? Yet you have turned justice into gall, And the fruit of righteousness into wormwood, 

###### 13 
You who rejoice over [^c]Lo Debar, Who say, "Have we not taken [^d]Karnaim for ourselves By our own strength?" 

###### 14 
"But, behold, I will raise up a nation against you, O house of Israel," Says the Lord God of hosts; "And they will afflict you from the entrance of Hamath To the Valley of the Arabah." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

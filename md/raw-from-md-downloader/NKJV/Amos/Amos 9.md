# Amos 9

***


###### 1 
I saw the Lord standing by the altar, and He said: "Strike the [^a]doorposts, that the thresholds may shake, And break them on the heads of them all. I will slay the last of them with the sword. He who flees from them shall not get away, And he who escapes from them shall not be delivered. 

###### 2 
"Though they dig into [^b]hell, From there My hand shall take them; Though they climb up to heaven, From there I will bring them down; 

###### 3 
And though they hide themselves on top of Carmel, From there I will search and take them; Though they hide from My sight at the bottom of the sea, From there I will command the serpent, and it shall bite them; 

###### 4 
Though they go into captivity before their enemies, From there I will command the sword, And it shall slay them. I will set My eyes on them for harm and not for good." 

###### 5 
The Lord God of hosts, He who touches the earth and it melts, And all who dwell there mourn; All of it shall swell like [^c]the River, And subside like the River of Egypt. 

###### 6 
He who builds His layers[^d] in the sky, And has founded His strata in the earth; Who calls for the waters of the sea, And pours them out on the face of the earth-- The Lord _is_ His name. 

###### 7 
"_Are_ you not like the [^e]people of Ethiopia to Me, O children of Israel?" says the Lord. "Did I not bring up Israel from the land of Egypt, The Philistines from Caphtor,[^f] And the Syrians from Kir? 

###### 8 
"Behold, the eyes of the Lord God _are_ on the sinful kingdom, And I will destroy it from the face of the earth; Yet I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob," Says the Lord. 

###### 9 
"For surely I will command, And will [^g]sift the house of Israel among all nations, As _grain_ is sifted in a sieve; Yet not the smallest [^h]grain shall fall to the ground. 

###### 10 
All the sinners of My people shall die by the sword, Who say, 'The calamity shall not overtake nor confront us.' ## Israel Will Be Restored 

###### 11 
"On that day I will raise up The [^i]tabernacle of David, which has fallen down, And [^j]repair its damages; I will raise up its ruins, And rebuild it as in the days of old; 

###### 12 
That they may possess the remnant of Edom,[^k] And all the Gentiles who are called by My name," Says the Lord who does this thing. 

###### 13 
"Behold, the days are coming," says the Lord, "When the plowman shall overtake the reaper, And the treader of grapes him who sows seed; The mountains shall drip with sweet wine, And all the hills shall flow _with it._ 

###### 14 
I will bring back the captives of My people Israel; They shall build the waste cities and inhabit _them;_ They shall plant vineyards and drink wine from them; They shall also make gardens and eat fruit from them. 

###### 15 
I will plant them in their land, And no longer shall they be pulled up From the land I have given them," Says the Lord your God. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

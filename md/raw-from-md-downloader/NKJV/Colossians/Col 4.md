# Colossians 4

***


###### 1 
Masters, give your bondservants what is just and fair, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven. ## Christian Graces 

###### 2 
Continue earnestly in prayer, being vigilant in it with thanksgiving; 

###### 3 
meanwhile praying also for us, that God would open to us a door for the word, to speak the [^a]mystery of Christ, for which I am also in chains, 

###### 4 
that I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak. 

###### 5 
Walk in wisdom toward those _who are_ outside, redeeming the time. 

###### 6 
_Let_ your speech always _be_ with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one. ## Final Greetings 

###### 7 
Tychicus, a beloved brother, faithful minister, and fellow servant in the Lord, will tell you all the news about me. 

###### 8 
I am sending him to you for this very purpose, that [^b]he may know your circumstances and comfort your hearts, 

###### 9 
with Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is _one_ of you. They will make known to you all things which _are happening_ here. 

###### 10 
Aristarchus my fellow prisoner greets you, with Mark the cousin of Barnabas (about whom you received instructions: if he comes to you, welcome him), 

###### 11 
and Jesus who is called Justus. These _are my_ only fellow workers for the kingdom of God who are of the circumcision; they have proved to be a comfort to me. 

###### 12 
Epaphras, who is _one_ of you, a bondservant of Christ, greets you, always laboring fervently for you in prayers, that you may stand perfect and [^c]complete in all the will of God. 

###### 13 
For I bear him witness that he has a great [^d]zeal for you, and those who are in Laodicea, and those in Hierapolis. 

###### 14 
Luke the beloved physician and Demas greet you. 

###### 15 
Greet the brethren who are in Laodicea, and [^e]Nymphas and the church that _is_ in [^f]his house. ## Closing Exhortations and Blessing 

###### 16 
Now when this epistle is read among you, see that it is read also in the church of the Laodiceans, and that you likewise read the _epistle_ from Laodicea. 

###### 17 
And say to Archippus, "Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you may fulfill it." 

###### 18 
This salutation by my own hand--Paul. Remember my chains. Grace _be_ with you. Amen. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Ecclesiastes 6

***


###### 1 
There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it _is_ common among men: 

###### 2 
A man to whom God has given riches and wealth and honor, so that he lacks nothing for himself of all he desires; yet God does not give him power to eat of it, but a foreigner consumes it. This _is_ vanity, and it _is_ an evil [^a]affliction. 

###### 3 
If a man begets a hundred _children_ and lives many years, so that the days of his years are many, but his soul is not satisfied with goodness, or indeed he has no burial, I say _that_ a [^b]stillborn child _is_ better than he-- 

###### 4 
for it comes in vanity and departs in darkness, and its name is covered with darkness. 

###### 5 
Though it has not seen the sun or known _anything,_ this has more rest than that man, 

###### 6 
even if he lives a thousand years twice--but has not seen goodness. Do not all go to one place? 

###### 7 
All the labor of man _is_ for his mouth, And yet the soul is not satisfied. 

###### 8 
For what more has the wise _man_ than the fool? What does the poor man have, Who knows _how_ to walk before the living? 

###### 9 
Better _is_ [^c]the sight of the eyes than the wandering of [^d]desire. This also _is_ vanity and grasping for the wind. 

###### 10 
Whatever one is, he has been named already, For it is known that he _is_ man; And he cannot contend with Him who is mightier than he. 

###### 11 
Since there are many things that increase vanity, How _is_ man the better? 

###### 12 
For who knows what _is_ good for man in life, [^e]all the days of his [^f]vain life which he passes like a shadow? Who can tell a man what will happen after him under the sun? ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

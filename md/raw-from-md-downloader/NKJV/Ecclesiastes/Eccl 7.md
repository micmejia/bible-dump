# Ecclesiastes 7

***


###### 1 
A good name _is_ better than precious ointment, And the day of death than the day of one's birth; 

###### 2 
Better to go to the house of mourning Than to go to the house of feasting, For that _is_ the end of all men; And the living will take _it_ to heart. 

###### 3 
[^a]Sorrow _is_ better than laughter, For by a sad countenance the heart is made [^b]better. 

###### 4 
The heart of the wise _is_ in the house of mourning, But the heart of fools _is_ in the house of mirth. 

###### 5 
_It is_ better to [^c]hear the rebuke of the wise Than for a man to hear the song of fools. 

###### 6 
For like the [^d]crackling of thorns under a pot, So _is_ the laughter of the fool. This also is vanity. 

###### 7 
Surely oppression destroys a wise _man's_ reason, And a bribe [^e]debases the heart. 

###### 8 
The end of a thing _is_ better than its beginning; The patient in spirit _is_ better than the proud in spirit. 

###### 9 
Do not hasten in your spirit to be angry, For anger rests in the bosom of fools. 

###### 10 
Do not say, "Why were the former days better than these?" For you do not inquire wisely concerning this. 

###### 11 
Wisdom _is_ good with an inheritance, And profitable to those who see the sun. 

###### 12 
For wisdom _is_ [^f]a defense _as_ money _is_ a defense, But the [^g]excellence of knowledge _is that_ wisdom gives life to those who have it. 

###### 13 
Consider the work of God; For who can make straight what He has made crooked? 

###### 14 
In the day of prosperity be joyful, But in the day of adversity consider: Surely God has appointed the one [^h]as well as the other, So that man can find out nothing _that will come_ after him. 

###### 15 
I have seen everything in my days of vanity: There is a just _man_ who perishes in his righteousness, And there is a wicked _man_ who prolongs _life_ in his wickedness. 

###### 16 
Do not be overly righteous, Nor be overly wise: Why should you destroy yourself? 

###### 17 
Do not be overly wicked, Nor be foolish: Why should you die before your time? 

###### 18 
_It is_ good that you grasp this, And also not remove your hand from the other; For he who fears God will [^i]escape them all. 

###### 19 
Wisdom strengthens the wise More than ten rulers of the city. 

###### 20 
For _there is_ not a just man on earth who does good And does not sin. 

###### 21 
Also do not take to heart everything people say, Lest you hear your servant cursing you. 

###### 22 
For many times, also, your own heart has known That even you have cursed others. 

###### 23 
All this I have [^j]proved by wisdom. I said, "I will be wise"; But it _was_ far from me. 

###### 24 
As for that which is far off and exceedingly deep, Who can find it out? 

###### 25 
I applied my heart to know, To search and seek out wisdom and the reason _of things,_ To know the wickedness of folly, Even of foolishness _and_ madness. 

###### 26 
And I find more bitter than death The woman whose heart _is_ snares and nets, Whose hands _are_ fetters. [^k]He who pleases God shall escape from her, But the sinner shall be trapped by her. 

###### 27 
"Here is what I have found," says the Preacher, "_Adding_ one thing to the other to find out the reason, 

###### 28 
Which my soul still seeks but I cannot find: One man among a thousand I have found, But a woman among all these I have not found. 

###### 29 
Truly, this only I have found: That God made man upright, But they have sought out many schemes." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

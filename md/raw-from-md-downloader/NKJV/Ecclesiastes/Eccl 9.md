# Ecclesiastes 9

***


###### 1 
For I [^a]considered all this in my heart, so that I could declare it all: that the righteous and the wise and their works _are_ in the hand of God. People know neither love nor hatred _by_ anything _they see_ before them. 

###### 2 
All things _come_ alike to all: One event _happens_ to the righteous and the wicked; To the [^b]good, the clean, and the unclean; To him who sacrifices and him who does not sacrifice. As is the good, so _is_ the sinner; He who takes an oath as _he_ who fears an oath. 

###### 3 
This _is_ an evil in all that is done under the sun: that one thing _happens_ to all. Truly the hearts of the sons of men are full of evil; madness _is_ in their hearts while they live, and after that _they go_ to the dead. 

###### 4 
But for him who is joined to all the living there is hope, for a living dog is better than a dead lion. 

###### 5 
For the living know that they will die; But the dead know nothing, And they have no more reward, For the memory of them is forgotten. 

###### 6 
Also their love, their hatred, and their envy have now perished; Nevermore will they have a share In anything done under the sun. 

###### 7 
Go, eat your bread with joy, And drink your wine with a merry heart; For God has already accepted your works. 

###### 8 
Let your garments always be white, And let your head lack no oil. 

###### 9 
[^c]Live joyfully with the wife whom you love all the days of your vain life which He has given you under the sun, all your days of vanity; for that _is_ your portion in life, and in the labor which you perform under the sun. 

###### 10 
Whatever your hand finds to do, do _it_ with your might; for _there is_ no work or device or knowledge or wisdom in the grave where you are going. 

###### 11 
I returned and saw under the sun that-- The race _is_ not to the swift, Nor the battle to the strong, Nor bread to the wise, Nor riches to men of understanding, Nor favor to men of skill; But time and chance happen to them all. 

###### 12 
For man also does not know his time: Like fish taken in a cruel net, Like birds caught in a snare, So the sons of men _are_ snared in an evil time, When it falls suddenly upon them. ## Wisdom Superior to Folly 

###### 13 
This wisdom I have also seen under the sun, and it _seemed_ great to me: 

###### 14 
_There was_ a little city with few men in it; and a great king came against it, besieged it, and built great [^d]snares around it. 

###### 15 
Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city. Yet no one remembered that same poor man. 

###### 16 
Then I said: "Wisdom _is_ better than strength. Nevertheless the poor man's wisdom _is_ despised, And his words are not heard. 

###### 17 
Words of the wise, _spoken_ quietly, _should be_ heard Rather than the shout of a ruler of fools. 

###### 18 
Wisdom _is_ better than weapons of war; But one sinner destroys much good." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Exodus 29

***


###### 1 
"And this is what you shall do to them to hallow them for ministering to Me as priests: Take one young bull and two rams without blemish, 

###### 2 
and unleavened bread, unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil (you shall make them of wheat flour). 

###### 3 
You shall put them in one basket and bring them in the basket, with the bull and the two rams. 

###### 4 
"And Aaron and his sons you shall bring to the door of the tabernacle of meeting, and you shall wash them with water. 

###### 5 
Then you shall take the garments, put the tunic on Aaron, and the robe of the ephod, the ephod, and the breastplate, and gird him with the intricately woven band of the ephod. 

###### 6 
You shall put the turban on his head, and put the holy crown on the turban. 

###### 7 
And you shall take the anointing oil, pour _it_ on his head, and anoint him. 

###### 8 
Then you shall bring his sons and put tunics on them. 

###### 9 
And you shall gird them with sashes, Aaron and his sons, and put the hats on them. The priesthood shall be theirs for a perpetual statute. So you shall consecrate Aaron and his sons. 

###### 10 
"You shall also have the bull brought before the tabernacle of meeting, and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands on the head of the bull. 

###### 11 
Then you shall kill the bull before the Lord, _by_ the door of the tabernacle of meeting. 

###### 12 
You shall take _some_ of the blood of the bull and put _it_ on the horns of the altar with your finger, and pour all the blood beside the base of the altar. 

###### 13 
And you shall take all the fat that covers the entrails, the fatty lobe _attached_ to the liver, and the two kidneys and the fat that _is_ on them, and burn _them_ on the altar. 

###### 14 
But the flesh of the bull, with its skin and its offal, you shall burn with fire outside the camp. It _is_ a sin offering. 

###### 15 
"You shall also take one ram, and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands on the head of the ram; 

###### 16 
and you shall kill the ram, and you shall take its blood and sprinkle _it_ all around on the altar. 

###### 17 
Then you shall cut the ram in pieces, wash its entrails and its legs, and put _them_ with its pieces and with its head. 

###### 18 
And you shall burn the whole ram on the altar. It _is_ a burnt offering to the Lord; it _is_ a sweet aroma, an offering made by fire to the Lord. 

###### 19 
"You shall also take the other ram, and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands on the head of the ram. 

###### 20 
Then you shall kill the ram, and take some of its blood and put _it_ on the tip of the right ear of Aaron and on the tip of the right ear of his sons, on the thumb of their right hand and on the big toe of their right foot, and sprinkle the blood all around on the altar. 

###### 21 
And you shall take some of the blood that is on the altar, and some of the anointing oil, and sprinkle _it_ on Aaron and on his garments, on his sons and on the garments of his sons with him; and he and his garments shall be hallowed, and his sons and his sons' garments with him. 

###### 22 
"Also you shall take the fat of the ram, the fat tail, the fat that covers the entrails, the fatty lobe _attached to_ the liver, the two kidneys and the fat on them, the right thigh (for it _is_ a ram of consecration), 

###### 23 
one loaf of bread, one cake _made with_ oil, and one wafer from the basket of the unleavened bread that _is_ before the Lord; 

###### 24 
and you shall put all these in the hands of Aaron and in the hands of his sons, and you shall wave them _as_ a wave offering before the Lord. 

###### 25 
You shall receive them back from their hands and burn _them_ on the altar as a burnt offering, as a sweet aroma before the Lord. It _is_ an offering made by fire to the Lord. 

###### 26 
"Then you shall take the breast of the ram of Aaron's consecration and wave it _as_ a wave offering before the Lord; and it shall be your portion. 

###### 27 
And from the ram of the consecration you shall consecrate the breast of the wave offering which is waved, and the thigh of the heave offering which is raised, of _that_ which _is_ for Aaron and of _that_ which is for his sons. 

###### 28 
It shall be from the children of Israel _for_ Aaron and his sons by a statute forever. For it is a heave offering; it shall be a heave offering from the children of Israel from the sacrifices of their peace offerings, _that is,_ their heave offering to the Lord. 

###### 29 
"And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after him, to be anointed in them and to be consecrated in them. 

###### 30 
That son who becomes priest in his place shall put them on for seven days, when he enters the tabernacle of meeting to minister in the [^a]holy _place._ 

###### 31 
"And you shall take the ram of the consecration and boil its flesh in the holy place. 

###### 32 
Then Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that _is_ in the basket, _by_ the door of the tabernacle of meeting. 

###### 33 
They shall eat those things with which the atonement was made, to consecrate _and_ to sanctify them; but an outsider shall not eat _them,_ because they _are_ holy. 

###### 34 
And if any of the flesh of the consecration offerings, or of the bread, remains until the morning, then you shall burn the remainder with fire. It shall not be eaten, because it _is_ holy. 

###### 35 
"Thus you shall do to Aaron and his sons, according to all that I have commanded you. Seven days you shall consecrate them. 

###### 36 
And you shall offer a bull every day _as_ a sin offering for atonement. You shall cleanse the altar when you make atonement for it, and you shall anoint it to sanctify it. 

###### 37 
Seven days you shall make atonement for the altar and sanctify it. And the altar shall be most holy. Whatever touches the altar must be holy. ## The Daily Offerings 

###### 38 
"Now this _is_ what you shall offer on the altar: two lambs of the first year, day by day continually. 

###### 39 
One lamb you shall offer in the morning, and the other lamb you shall offer [^b]at twilight. 

###### 40 
With the one lamb shall be one-tenth _of an ephah_ of flour mixed with one-fourth of a hin of pressed oil, and one-fourth of a hin of wine _as_ a drink offering. 

###### 41 
And the other lamb you shall offer [^c]at twilight; and you shall offer with it the grain offering and the drink offering, as in the morning, for a sweet aroma, an offering made by fire to the Lord. 

###### 42 
_This shall be_ a continual burnt offering throughout your generations _at_ the door of the tabernacle of meeting before the Lord, where I will meet you to speak with you. 

###### 43 
And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and _the tabernacle_ shall be sanctified by My glory. 

###### 44 
So I will consecrate the tabernacle of meeting and the altar. I will also consecrate both Aaron and his sons to minister to Me as priests. 

###### 45 
I will dwell among the children of Israel and will be their God. 

###### 46 
And they shall know that I _am_ the Lord their God, who brought them up out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them. I _am_ the Lord their God. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

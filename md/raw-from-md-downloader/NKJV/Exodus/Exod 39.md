# Exodus 39

***


###### 1 
Of the blue, purple, and scarlet _thread_ they made garments[^a] of ministry, for ministering in the [^b]holy _place,_ and made the holy garments for Aaron, as the Lord had commanded Moses. ## Making the Ephod 

###### 2 
He made the ephod of gold, blue, purple, and scarlet _thread,_ and of fine woven linen. 

###### 3 
And they beat the gold into thin sheets and cut _it into_ threads, to work _it_ in _with_ the blue, purple, and scarlet _thread,_ and the fine linen, _into_ artistic designs. 

###### 4 
They made shoulder straps for it to couple _it_ together; it was coupled together at its two edges. 

###### 5 
And the intricately woven band of his ephod that _was_ on it _was_ of the same workmanship, _woven of_ gold, blue, purple, and scarlet _thread,_ and _of_ fine woven linen, as the Lord had commanded Moses. 

###### 6 
And they set onyx stones, enclosed in [^c]settings of gold; they were engraved, as signets are engraved, with the names of the sons of Israel. 

###### 7 
He put them on the shoulders of the ephod _as_ memorial stones for the sons of Israel, as the Lord had commanded Moses. ## Making the Breastplate 

###### 8 
And he made the breastplate, artistically woven like the workmanship of the ephod, of gold, blue, purple, and scarlet _thread,_ and of fine woven linen. 

###### 9 
They made the breastplate square by doubling it; a span _was_ its length and a span its width when doubled. 

###### 10 
And they set in it four rows of stones: a row with a sardius, a topaz, and an emerald was the first row; 

###### 11 
the second row, a turquoise, a sapphire, and a diamond; 

###### 12 
the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst; 

###### 13 
the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper. _They were_ enclosed in settings of gold in their mountings. 

###### 14 
_There were_ twelve stones according to the names of the sons of Israel: according to their names, _engraved like_ a signet, each one with its own name according to the twelve tribes. 

###### 15 
And they made chains for the breastplate at the ends, like braided cords of pure gold. 

###### 16 
They also made two settings of gold and two gold rings, and put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate. 

###### 17 
And they put the two braided _chains_ of gold in the two rings on the ends of the breastplate. 

###### 18 
The two ends of the two braided _chains_ they fastened in the two settings, and put them on the shoulder straps of the ephod in the front. 

###### 19 
And they made two rings of gold and put _them_ on the two ends of the breastplate, on the edge of it, which _was_ on the inward side of the ephod. 

###### 20 
They made two _other_ gold rings and put them on the two shoulder straps, underneath the ephod toward its front, right at the seam above the intricately woven band of the ephod. 

###### 21 
And they bound the breastplate by means of its rings to the rings of the ephod with a blue cord, so that it would be above the intricately woven band of the ephod, and that the breastplate would not come loose from the ephod, as the Lord had commanded Moses. ## Making the Other Priestly Garments 

###### 22 
He made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue. 

###### 23 
And _there was_ an opening in the middle of the robe, like the opening in a coat of mail, _with_ a woven binding all around the opening, so that it would not tear. 

###### 24 
They made on the hem of the robe pomegranates of blue, purple, and scarlet, and of fine woven _linen._ 

###### 25 
And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates on the hem of the robe all around between the pomegranates: 

###### 26 
a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, all around the hem of the robe to [^d]minister in, as the Lord had commanded Moses. 

###### 27 
They made tunics, artistically woven of fine linen, for Aaron and his sons, 

###### 28 
a turban of fine linen, exquisite hats of fine linen, short trousers of fine woven linen, 

###### 29 
and a sash of fine woven linen with blue, purple, and scarlet _thread,_ made by a weaver, as the Lord had commanded Moses. 

###### 30 
Then they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote on it an inscription _like_ the engraving of a signet: HOLINESS TO THE LORD. 

###### 31 
And they tied to it a blue cord, to fasten _it_ above on the turban, as the Lord had commanded Moses. ## The Work Completed 

###### 32 
Thus all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting was finished. And the children of Israel did according to all that the Lord had commanded Moses; so they did. 

###### 33 
And they brought the tabernacle to Moses, the tent and all its furnishings: its clasps, its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets; 

###### 34 
the covering of ram skins dyed red, the covering of badger skins, and the veil of the covering; 

###### 35 
the ark of the Testimony with its poles, and the mercy seat; 

###### 36 
the table, all its utensils, and the showbread; 

###### 37 
the pure _gold_ lampstand with its lamps (the lamps set in order), all its utensils, and the oil for light; 

###### 38 
the gold altar, the anointing oil, and the sweet incense; the screen for the tabernacle door; 

###### 39 
the bronze altar, its grate of bronze, its poles, and all its utensils; the laver with its base; 

###### 40 
the hangings of the court, its pillars and its sockets, the screen for the court gate, its cords, and its pegs; all the utensils for the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of meeting; 

###### 41 
and the [^e]garments of ministry, to [^f]minister in the holy _place:_ the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons' garments, to minister as priests. 

###### 42 
According to all that the Lord had commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did all the work. 

###### 43 
Then Moses looked over all the work, and indeed they had done it; as the Lord had commanded, just so they had done it. And Moses blessed them. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

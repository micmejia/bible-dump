# Ezekiel 15

***


###### 1 
Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying: 

###### 2 
"Son of man, how is the wood of the vine _better_ than any other wood, the vine branch which is among the trees of the forest? 

###### 3 
Is wood taken from it to make any object? Or can _men_ make a peg from it to hang any vessel on? 

###### 4 
Instead, it is thrown into the fire for fuel; the fire devours both ends of it, and its middle is burned. Is it useful for _any_ work? 

###### 5 
Indeed, when it was whole, no object could be made from it. How much less will it be useful for _any_ work when the fire has devoured it, and it is burned? 

###### 6 
"Therefore thus says the Lord God: 'Like the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so I will give up the inhabitants of Jerusalem; 

###### 7 
and I will set My face against them. They will go out from _one_ fire, but _another_ fire shall devour them. Then you shall know that I _am_ the Lord, when I set My face against them. 

###### 8 
Thus I will make the land desolate, because they have persisted in unfaithfulness,' says the Lord God." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

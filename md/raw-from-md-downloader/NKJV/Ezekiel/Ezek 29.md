# Ezekiel 29

***


###### 1 
In the tenth year, in the tenth _month,_ on the twelfth _day_ of the month, the word of the Lord came to me, saying, 

###### 2 
"Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt. 

###### 3 
Speak, and say, 'Thus says the Lord God: "Behold, I _am_ against you, O Pharaoh king of Egypt, O great monster who lies in the midst of his rivers, Who has said, 'My [^a]River _is_ my own; I have made _it_ for myself.' 

###### 4 
But I will put hooks in your jaws, And cause the fish of your rivers to stick to your scales; I will bring you up out of the midst of your rivers, And all the fish in your rivers will stick to your scales. 

###### 5 
I will leave you in the wilderness, You and all the fish of your rivers; You shall fall on the [^b]open field; You shall not be picked up or [^c]gathered. I have given you as food To the beasts of the field And to the birds of the heavens. 

###### 6 
"Then all the inhabitants of Egypt Shall know that I _am_ the Lord, Because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel. 

###### 7 
When they took hold of you with the hand, You broke and tore all their [^d]shoulders; When they leaned on you, You broke and made all their backs quiver." 

###### 8 
'Therefore thus says the Lord God: "Surely I will bring a sword upon you and cut off from you man and beast. 

###### 9 
And the land of Egypt shall become desolate and waste; then they will know that I _am_ the Lord, because he said, 'The River _is_ mine, and I have made _it._' 

###### 10 
Indeed, therefore, I _am_ against you and against your rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste and desolate, from [^e]Migdol _to_ Syene, as far as the border of Ethiopia. 

###### 11 
Neither foot of man shall pass through it nor foot of beast pass through it, and it shall be uninhabited forty years. 

###### 12 
I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the countries _that are_ desolate; and among the cities _that are_ laid waste, her cities shall be desolate forty years; and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them throughout the countries." 

###### 13 
'Yet, thus says the Lord God: "At the end of forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the peoples among whom they were scattered. 

###### 14 
I will bring back the captives of Egypt and cause them to return to the land of Pathros, to the land of their origin, and there they shall be a lowly kingdom. 

###### 15 
It shall be the lowliest of kingdoms; it shall never again exalt itself above the nations, for I will diminish them so that they will not rule over the nations anymore. 

###### 16 
No longer shall it be the confidence of the house of Israel, but will remind them of _their_ iniquity when they turned to follow them. Then they shall know that I _am_ the Lord God." ' " ## Babylonia Will Plunder Egypt 

###### 17 
And it came to pass in the twenty-seventh year, in the first _month,_ on the first _day_ of the month, _that_ the word of the Lord came to me, saying, 

###### 18 
"Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon caused his army to labor strenuously against Tyre; every head _was_ made bald, and every shoulder rubbed raw; yet neither he nor his army received wages from Tyre, for the labor which they expended on it. 

###### 19 
Therefore thus says the Lord God: 'Surely I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; he shall take away her wealth, carry off her spoil, and remove her pillage; and that will be the wages for his army. 

###### 20 
I have given him the land of Egypt _for_ his labor, because they worked for Me,' says the Lord God. 

###### 21 
'In that day I will cause the [^f]horn of the house of Israel to spring forth, and I will open your mouth to speak in their midst. Then they shall know that I _am_ the Lord.'

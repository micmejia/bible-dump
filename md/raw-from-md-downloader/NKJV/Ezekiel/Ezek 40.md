# Ezekiel 40

***


###### 1 
In the twenty-fifth year of our captivity, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth _day_ of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was [^a]captured, on the very same day the hand of the Lord was upon me; and He took me there. 

###### 2 
In the visions of God He took me into the land of Israel and set me on a very high mountain; on it toward the south _was_ something like the structure of a city. 

###### 3 
He took me there, and behold, _there was_ a man whose appearance _was_ like the appearance of bronze. He had a line of flax and a measuring rod in his hand, and he stood in the gateway. 

###### 4 
And the man said to me, "Son of man, look with your eyes and hear with your ears, and [^b]fix your mind on everything I show you; for you _were_ brought here so that I might show _them_ to you. Declare to the house of Israel everything you see." 

###### 5 
Now there was a wall all around the outside of the [^c]temple. In the man's hand was a measuring rod six [^d]cubits _long, each being a_ cubit and a handbreadth; and he measured the width of the wall structure, one rod; and the height, one rod. ## The Eastern Gateway of the Temple 

###### 6 
Then he went to the gateway which faced east; and he went up its stairs and measured the threshold of the gateway, _which was_ one rod wide, and the other threshold _was_ one rod wide. 

###### 7 
Each gate chamber _was_ one rod long and one rod wide; between the gate chambers _was a space of_ five cubits; and the threshold of the gateway by the vestibule of the inside gate _was_ one rod. 

###### 8 
He also measured the vestibule of the inside gate, one rod. 

###### 9 
Then he measured the vestibule of the gateway, eight cubits; and the gateposts, two cubits. The vestibule of the gate _was_ on the inside. 

###### 10 
In the eastern gateway _were_ three gate chambers on one side and three on the other; the three _were_ all the same size; also the gateposts were of the same size on this side and that side. 

###### 11 
He measured the width of the entrance to the gateway, ten cubits; _and_ the length of the gate, thirteen cubits. 

###### 12 
_There was_ a [^e]space in front of the gate chambers, one cubit _on this side_ and one cubit on that side; the gate chambers _were_ six cubits on this side and six cubits on that side. 

###### 13 
Then he measured the gateway from the roof of _one_ gate chamber to the roof of the other; the width _was_ twenty-five cubits, as door faces door. 

###### 14 
He measured the gateposts, sixty cubits high, and the court all around the gateway _extended_ to the gatepost. 

###### 15 
_From_ the front of the entrance gate to the front of the vestibule of the inner gate _was_ fifty cubits. 

###### 16 
_There were_ beveled window _frames_ in the gate chambers and in their intervening archways on the inside of the gateway all around, and likewise in the vestibules. _There were_ windows all around on the inside. And on each gatepost _were_ palm trees. ## The Outer Court 

###### 17 
Then he brought me into the outer court; and _there were_ chambers and a pavement made all around the court; thirty chambers faced the pavement. 

###### 18 
The pavement was by the side of the gateways, corresponding to the length of the gateways; _this was_ the lower pavement. 

###### 19 
Then he measured the width from the front of the lower gateway to the front of the inner court exterior, one hundred cubits toward the east and the north. ## The Northern Gateway 

###### 20 
On the outer court was also a gateway facing north, and he measured its length and its width. 

###### 21 
Its gate chambers, three on this side and three on that side, its gateposts and its archways, had the same measurements as the first gate; its length _was_ fifty cubits and its width twenty-five cubits. 

###### 22 
Its windows and those of its archways, and also its palm trees, _had_ the same measurements as the gateway facing east; it was ascended by seven steps, and its archway _was_ in front of it. 

###### 23 
A gate of the inner court was opposite the northern gateway, just as the eastern _gateway;_ and he measured from gateway to gateway, one hundred cubits. ## The Southern Gateway 

###### 24 
After that he brought me toward the south, and there a gateway was facing south; and he measured its gateposts and archways according to these same measurements. 

###### 25 
_There were_ windows in it and in its archways all around like those windows; its length _was_ fifty cubits and its width twenty-five cubits. 

###### 26 
Seven steps led up to it, and its archway _was_ in front of them; and it had palm trees on its gateposts, one on this side and one on that side. 

###### 27 
_There was_ also a gateway on the inner court, facing south; and he measured from gateway to gateway toward the south, one hundred cubits. ## Gateways of the Inner Court 

###### 28 
Then he brought me to the inner court through the southern gateway; he measured the southern gateway according to these same measurements. 

###### 29 
Also its gate chambers, its gateposts, and its archways _were_ according to these same measurements; _there were_ windows in it and in its archways all around; _it was_ fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. 

###### 30 
_There were_ archways all around, twenty-five cubits long and five cubits wide. 

###### 31 
Its archways faced the outer court, palm trees _were_ on its gateposts, and going up to it _were_ eight steps. 

###### 32 
And he brought me into the inner court facing east; he measured the gateway according to these same measurements. 

###### 33 
Also its gate chambers, its gateposts, and its archways _were_ according to these same measurements; and _there were_ windows in it and in its archways all around; _it was_ fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. 

###### 34 
Its archways faced the outer court, and palm trees _were_ on its gateposts on this side and on that side; and going up to it _were_ eight steps. 

###### 35 
Then he brought me to the north gateway and measured _it_ according to these same measurements-- 

###### 36 
also its gate chambers, its gateposts, and its archways. It had windows all around; its length _was_ fifty cubits and its width twenty-five cubits. 

###### 37 
Its gateposts faced the outer court, palm trees _were_ on its gateposts on this side and on that side, and going up to it _were_ eight steps. ## Where Sacrifices Were Prepared 

###### 38 
_There was_ a chamber and its entrance by the gateposts of the gateway, where they washed the burnt offering. 

###### 39 
In the vestibule of the gateway _were_ two tables on this side and two tables on that side, on which to slay the burnt offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering. 

###### 40 
At the outer side of the _vestibule_, as one goes up to the entrance of the northern gateway, _were_ two tables; and on the other side of the vestibule of the gateway _were_ two tables. 

###### 41 
Four tables _were_ on this side and four tables on that side, by the side of the gateway, eight tables on which they slaughtered _the sacrifices._ 

###### 42 
_There were_ also four tables of hewn stone for the burnt offering, one cubit and a half long, one cubit and a half wide, and one cubit high; on these they laid the instruments with which they slaughtered the burnt offering and the sacrifice. 

###### 43 
Inside _were_ hooks, a handbreadth wide, fastened all around; and the flesh of the sacrifices _was_ on the tables. ## Chambers for Singers and Priests 

###### 44 
Outside the inner gate _were_ the chambers for the singers in the inner court, one facing south at the side of the northern gateway, and the other facing north at the side of the [^f]southern gateway. 

###### 45 
Then he said to me, "This chamber which faces south _is_ for the priests who have charge of the temple. 

###### 46 
The chamber which faces north _is_ for the priests who have charge of the altar; these _are_ the sons of Zadok, from the sons of Levi, who come near the Lord to minister to Him." ## Dimensions of the Inner Court and Vestibule 

###### 47 
And he measured the court, one hundred cubits long and one hundred cubits wide, foursquare. The altar _was_ in front of the temple. 

###### 48 
Then he brought me to the vestibule of the temple and measured the doorposts of the vestibule, five cubits on this side and five cubits on that side; and the width of the gateway was three cubits on this side and three cubits on that side. 

###### 49 
The length of the vestibule _was_ twenty cubits, and the width eleven cubits; and by the steps which led up to it _there were_ pillars by the doorposts, one on this side and another on that side. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

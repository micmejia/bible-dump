# Ezra 5

***


###### 1 
Then the prophet Haggai and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophets, prophesied to the Jews who _were_ in Judah and Jerusalem, in the name of the God of Israel, _who was_ over them. 

###### 2 
So Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of [^a]Jozadak rose up and began to build the house of God which _is_ in Jerusalem; and the prophets of God _were_ with them, helping them. 

###### 3 
At the same time Tattenai the governor of _the region_ beyond [^b]the River and Shethar-Boznai and their companions came to them and spoke thus to them: "Who has commanded you to build this [^c]temple and finish this wall?" 

###### 4 
Then, accordingly, we told them the names of the men who were constructing this building. 

###### 5 
But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, so that they could not make them cease till a report could go to Darius. Then a written answer was returned concerning this _matter._ 

###### 6 
This is a copy of the letter that Tattenai sent: The governor of _the region_ beyond the River, and Shethar-Boznai, and his companions, the Persians who _were in the region_ beyond the River, to Darius the king. 

###### 7 
(They sent a letter to him, in which was written thus.) To Darius the king: All peace. 

###### 8 
Let it be known to the king that we went into the province of Judea, to the [^d]temple of the great God, which is being built with [^e]heavy stones, and timber is being laid in the walls; and this work goes on diligently and prospers in their hands. 

###### 9 
Then we asked those elders, _and_ spoke thus to them: "Who commanded you to build this temple and to finish these walls?" 

###### 10 
We also asked them their names to inform you, that we might write the names of the men who _were_ chief among them. 

###### 11 
And thus they returned us an answer, saying: "We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are rebuilding the [^f]temple that was built many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and completed. 

###### 12 
But because our fathers provoked the God of heaven to wrath, He gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, _who_ destroyed this temple and carried the people away to Babylon. 

###### 13 
However, in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, King Cyrus issued a decree to build this [^g]house of God. 

###### 14 
Also, the gold and silver articles of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple that _was_ in Jerusalem and carried into the temple of Babylon--those King Cyrus took from the temple of Babylon, and they were given to one named Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor. 

###### 15 
And he said to him, 'Take these articles; go, carry them to the temple _site_ that _is_ in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be rebuilt on its former site.' 

###### 16 
Then the same Sheshbazzar came _and_ laid the foundation of the house of God which _is_ in Jerusalem; but from that time even until now it has been under construction, and it is not finished." 

###### 17 
Now therefore, if _it seems_ good to the king, let a search be made in the king's treasure house, which _is_ there in Babylon, whether it is _so_ that a decree was issued by King Cyrus to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send us his pleasure concerning this _matter._ ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

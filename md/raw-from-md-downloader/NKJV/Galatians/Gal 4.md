# Galatians 4

***


###### 1 
Now I say _that_ the heir, as long as he is a child, does not differ at all from a slave, though he is master of all, 

###### 2 
but is under guardians and stewards until the time appointed by the father. 

###### 3 
Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world. 

###### 4 
But when the fullness of the time had come, God sent forth His Son, born[^a] of a woman, born under the law, 

###### 5 
to redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption as sons. 

###### 6 
And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying out, [^b]"Abba, Father!" 

###### 7 
Therefore you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son, then an heir [^c]of God [^d]through Christ. ## Fears for the Church 

###### 8 
But then, indeed, when you did not know God, you served those which by nature are not gods. 

###### 9 
But now after you have known God, or rather are known by God, how _is it that_ you turn again to the weak and beggarly elements, to which you desire again to be in bondage? 

###### 10 
You observe days and months and seasons and years. 

###### 11 
I am afraid for you, lest I have labored for you in vain. 

###### 12 
Brethren, I urge you to become like me, for I _became_ like you. You have not injured me at all. 

###### 13 
You know that because of physical infirmity I preached the gospel to you at the first. 

###### 14 
And my trial which was in my flesh you did not despise or reject, but you received me as an [^e]angel of God, _even_ as Christ Jesus. 

###### 15 
[^f]What then was the blessing you _enjoyed?_ For I bear you witness that, if possible, you would have plucked out your own eyes and given them to me. 

###### 16 
Have I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth? 

###### 17 
They zealously court you, _but_ for no good; yes, they want to exclude you, that you may be zealous for them. 

###### 18 
But it is good to be zealous in a good thing always, and not only when I am present with you. 

###### 19 
My little children, for whom I labor in birth again until Christ is formed in you, 

###### 20 
I would like to be present with you now and to change my tone; for I have doubts about you. ## Two Covenants 

###### 21 
Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not hear the law? 

###### 22 
For it is written that Abraham had two sons: the one by a bondwoman, the other by a freewoman. 

###### 23 
But he _who was_ of the bondwoman was born according to the flesh, and he of the freewoman through promise, 

###### 24 
which things are symbolic. For these are [^g]the two covenants: the one from Mount Sinai which gives birth to bondage, which is Hagar-- 

###### 25 
for this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children-- 

###### 26 
but the Jerusalem above is free, which is the mother of us all. 

###### 27 
For it is written: "Rejoice, O barren, _You_ who do not bear! Break forth and shout, You who are not in labor! For the desolate has many more children Than she who has a husband." 

###### 28 
Now we, brethren, as Isaac _was,_ are children of promise. 

###### 29 
But, as he who was born according to the flesh then persecuted him _who was born_ according to the Spirit, even so _it is_ now. 

###### 30 
Nevertheless what does the Scripture say? "Cast out the bondwoman and her son, for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman." 

###### 31 
So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman but of the free. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

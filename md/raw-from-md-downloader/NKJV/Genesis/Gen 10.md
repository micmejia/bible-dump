# Genesis 10

***


###### 1 
Now this _is_ the genealogy of the sons of Noah: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. And sons were born to them after the flood. 

###### 2 
The sons of Japheth _were_ Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras. 

###### 3 
The sons of Gomer _were_ Ashkenaz, [^a]Riphath, and Togarmah. 

###### 4 
The sons of Javan _were_ Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and [^b]Dodanim. 

###### 5 
From these the coastland _peoples_ of the Gentiles were separated into their lands, everyone according to his language, according to their families, into their nations. 

###### 6 
The sons of Ham _were_ Cush, Mizraim, [^c]Put, and Canaan. 

###### 7 
The sons of Cush _were_ Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabtechah; and the sons of Raamah _were_ Sheba and Dedan. 

###### 8 
Cush begot Nimrod; he began to be a mighty one on the earth. 

###### 9 
He was a mighty hunter before the Lord; therefore it is said, "Like Nimrod the mighty hunter before the Lord." 

###### 10 
And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. 

###### 11 
From that land he went to Assyria and built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah, 

###### 12 
and Resen between Nineveh and Calah (that _is_ the principal city). 

###### 13 
Mizraim begot Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim, 

###### 14 
Pathrusim, and Casluhim (from whom came the Philistines and Caphtorim). 

###### 15 
Canaan begot Sidon his firstborn, and Heth; 

###### 16 
the Jebusite, the Amorite, and the Girgashite; 

###### 17 
the Hivite, the Arkite, and the Sinite; 

###### 18 
the Arvadite, the Zemarite, and the Hamathite. Afterward the families of the Canaanites were dispersed. 

###### 19 
And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon as you go toward Gerar, as far as Gaza; then as you go toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha. 

###### 20 
These _were_ the sons of Ham, according to their families, according to their languages, in their lands _and_ in their nations. 

###### 21 
And _children_ were born also to Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, [^d]the brother of Japheth the elder. 

###### 22 
The sons of Shem _were_ Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram. 

###### 23 
The sons of Aram _were_ Uz, Hul, Gether, and [^e]Mash. 

###### 24 
[^f]Arphaxad begot Salah, and Salah begot Eber. 

###### 25 
To Eber were born two sons: the name of one _was_ [^g]Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided; and his brother's name _was_ Joktan. 

###### 26 
Joktan begot Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, 

###### 27 
Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, 

###### 28 
[^h]Obal, Abimael, Sheba, 

###### 29 
Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these _were_ the sons of Joktan. 

###### 30 
And their dwelling place was from Mesha as you go toward Sephar, the mountain of the east. 

###### 31 
These _were_ the sons of Shem, according to their families, according to their languages, in their lands, according to their nations. 

###### 32 
These _were_ the families of the sons of Noah, according to their generations, in their nations; and from these the nations were divided on the earth after the flood. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Genesis 13

***


###### 1 
Then Abram went up from Egypt, he and his wife and all that he had, and Lot with him, to the [^a]South. 

###### 2 
Abram _was_ very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold. 

###### 3 
And he went on his journey from the South as far as Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai, 

###### 4 
to the place of the altar which he had made there at first. And there Abram called on the name of the Lord. 

###### 5 
Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks and herds and tents. 

###### 6 
Now the land was not able to [^b]support them, that they might dwell together, for their possessions were so great that they could not dwell together. 

###### 7 
And there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram's livestock and the herdsmen of Lot's livestock. The Canaanites and the Perizzites then dwelt in the land. 

###### 8 
So Abram said to Lot, "Please let there be no strife between you and me, and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen; for we _are_ brethren. 

###### 9 
_Is_ not the whole land before you? Please separate from me. If _you take_ the left, then I will go to the right; or, if _you go_ to the right, then I will go to the left." 

###### 10 
And Lot lifted his eyes and saw all the plain of Jordan, that it _was_ well watered everywhere (before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah) like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt as you go toward Zoar. 

###### 11 
Then Lot chose for himself all the plain of Jordan, and Lot journeyed east. And they separated from each other. 

###### 12 
Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the plain and pitched _his_ tent even as far as Sodom. 

###### 13 
But the men of Sodom _were_ exceedingly wicked and sinful against the Lord. 

###### 14 
And the Lord said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him: "Lift your eyes now and look from the place where you are--northward, southward, eastward, and westward; 

###### 15 
for all the land which you see I give to you and your [^c]descendants forever. 

###### 16 
And I will make your descendants as the dust of the earth; so that if a man could number the dust of the earth, _then_ your descendants also could be numbered. 

###### 17 
Arise, walk in the land through its length and its width, for I give it to you." 

###### 18 
Then Abram moved _his_ tent, and went and dwelt by [^d]the terebinth trees of Mamre, which _are_ in Hebron, and built an altar there to the Lord. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

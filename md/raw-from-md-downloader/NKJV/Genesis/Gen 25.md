# Genesis 25

***


###### 1 
Abraham again took a wife, and her name _was_ Keturah. 

###### 2 
And she bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. 

###### 3 
Jokshan begot Sheba and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim. 

###### 4 
And the sons of Midian _were_ Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abidah, and Eldaah. All these _were_ the children of Keturah. 

###### 5 
And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac. 

###### 6 
But Abraham gave gifts to the sons of the concubines which Abraham had; and while he was still living he sent them eastward, away from Isaac his son, to the country of the east. ## Abraham's Death and Burial 

###### 7 
This _is_ the sum of the years of Abraham's life which he lived: one hundred and seventy-five years. 

###### 8 
Then Abraham breathed his last and died in a good old age, an old man and full _of years,_ and was gathered to his people. 

###### 9 
And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, which _is_ before Mamre, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, 

###### 10 
the field which Abraham purchased from the sons of Heth. There Abraham was buried, and Sarah his wife. 

###### 11 
And it came to pass, after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac. And Isaac dwelt at Beer Lahai Roi. ## The Families of Ishmael and Isaac 

###### 12 
Now this _is_ the genealogy of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's maidservant, bore to Abraham. 

###### 13 
And these _were_ the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: The firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, 

###### 14 
Mishma, Dumah, Massa, 

###### 15 
[^a]Hadar, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. 

###### 16 
These _were_ the sons of Ishmael and these _were_ their names, by their towns and their [^b]settlements, twelve princes according to their nations. 

###### 17 
These _were_ the years of the life of Ishmael: one hundred and thirty-seven years; and he breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people. 

###### 18 
(They dwelt from Havilah as far as Shur, which _is_ east of Egypt as you go toward Assyria.) He [^c]died in the presence of all his brethren. 

###### 19 
This _is_ the genealogy of Isaac, Abraham's son. Abraham begot Isaac. 

###### 20 
Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah as wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan Aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian. 

###### 21 
Now Isaac pleaded with the Lord for his wife, because she _was_ barren; and the Lord granted his plea, and Rebekah his wife conceived. 

###### 22 
But the children struggled together within her; and she said, "If _all is_ well, why _am I like_ this?" So she went to inquire of the Lord. 

###### 23 
And the Lord said to her: "Two nations _are_ in your womb, Two peoples shall be separated from your body; _One_ people shall be stronger than the other, And the older shall serve the younger." 

###### 24 
So when her days were fulfilled _for her_ to give birth, indeed _there were_ twins in her womb. 

###### 25 
And the first came out red. _He was_ like a hairy garment all over; so they called his name [^d]Esau. 

###### 26 
Afterward his brother came out, and his hand took hold of Esau's heel; so his name was called [^e]Jacob. Isaac _was_ sixty years old when she bore them. 

###### 27 
So the boys grew. And Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field; but Jacob was a [^f]mild man, dwelling in tents. 

###### 28 
And Isaac loved Esau because he ate _of his_ game, but Rebekah loved Jacob. ## Esau Sells His Birthright 

###### 29 
Now Jacob cooked a stew; and Esau came in from the field, and he _was_ weary. 

###### 30 
And Esau said to Jacob, "Please feed me with that same red _stew,_ for I _am_ weary." Therefore his name was called [^g]Edom. 

###### 31 
But Jacob said, "Sell me your birthright as of this day." 

###### 32 
And Esau said, "Look, I _am_ about to die; so what _is_ this birthright to me?" 

###### 33 
Then Jacob said, [^h]"Swear to me as of this day." So he swore to him, and sold his birthright to Jacob. 

###### 34 
And Jacob gave Esau bread and stew of lentils; then he ate and drank, arose, and went his way. Thus Esau despised _his_ birthright. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

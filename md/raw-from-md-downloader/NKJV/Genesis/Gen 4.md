# Genesis 4

***


###### 1 
Now Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore [^a]Cain, and said, "I have acquired a man from the Lord." 

###### 2 
Then she bore again, this time his brother [^b]Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. 

###### 3 
And [^c]in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought an offering of the fruit of the ground to the Lord. 

###### 4 
Abel also brought of the firstborn of his flock and of their fat. And the Lord respected Abel and his offering, 

###### 5 
but He did not respect Cain and his offering. And Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell. 

###### 6 
So the Lord said to Cain, "Why are you angry? And why has your countenance fallen? 

###### 7 
If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin lies at the door. And its desire _is_ [^d]for you, but you should rule over it." 

###### 8 
Now Cain [^e]talked with Abel his [^f]brother; and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and killed him. 

###### 9 
Then the Lord said to Cain, "Where _is_ Abel your brother?" He said, "I do not know. _Am_ I my brother's keeper?" 

###### 10 
And He said, "What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood cries out to Me from the ground. 

###### 11 
So now you _are_ cursed from the earth, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand. 

###### 12 
When you till the ground, it shall no longer yield its strength to you. A fugitive and a vagabond you shall be on the earth." 

###### 13 
And Cain said to the Lord, "My [^g]punishment _is_ greater than I can bear! 

###### 14 
Surely You have driven me out this day from the face of the ground; I shall be hidden from Your face; I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond on the earth, and it will happen _that_ anyone who finds me will kill me." 

###### 15 
And the Lord said to him, [^h]"Therefore, whoever kills Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold." And the Lord set a mark on Cain, lest anyone finding him should kill him. ## The Family of Cain 

###### 16 
Then Cain went out from the presence of the Lord and dwelt in the land of [^i]Nod on the east of Eden. 

###### 17 
And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. And he built a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son--Enoch. 

###### 18 
To Enoch was born Irad; and Irad begot Mehujael, and Mehujael begot Methushael, and Methushael begot Lamech. 

###### 19 
Then Lamech took for himself two wives: the name of one _was_ Adah, and the name of the second _was_ Zillah. 

###### 20 
And Adah bore Jabal. He was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock. 

###### 21 
His brother's name _was_ Jubal. He was the father of all those who play the harp and [^j]flute. 

###### 22 
And as for Zillah, she also bore Tubal-Cain, an instructor of every craftsman in bronze and iron. And the sister of Tubal-Cain _was_ Naamah. 

###### 23 
Then Lamech said to his wives: "Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; Wives of Lamech, listen to my speech! For I have [^k]killed a man for wounding me, Even a young man [^l]for hurting me. 

###### 24 
If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, Then Lamech seventy-sevenfold." ## A New Son 

###### 25 
And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son and named him [^m]Seth, "For God has appointed another seed for me instead of Abel, whom Cain killed." 

###### 26 
And as for Seth, to him also a son was born; and he named him [^n]Enosh. Then _men_ began to call on the name of the Lord. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

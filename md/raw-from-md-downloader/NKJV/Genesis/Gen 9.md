# Genesis 9

***


###### 1 
So God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them: "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth. 

###### 2 
And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be on every beast of the earth, on every bird of the air, on all that move _on_ the earth, and on all the fish of the sea. They are given into your hand. 

###### 3 
Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you. I have given you all things, even as the green herbs. 

###### 4 
But you shall not eat flesh with its life, _that is,_ its blood. 

###### 5 
Surely for your lifeblood I will demand _a reckoning;_ from the hand of every beast I will require it, and from the hand of man. From the hand of every man's brother I will require the life of man. 

###### 6 
"Whoever sheds man's blood, By man his blood shall be shed; For in the image of God He made man. 

###### 7 
And as for you, be fruitful and multiply; Bring forth abundantly in the earth And multiply in it." 

###### 8 
Then God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him, saying: 

###### 9 
"And as for Me, behold, I establish My covenant with you and with your [^a]descendants after you, 

###### 10 
and with every living creature that _is_ with you: the birds, the cattle, and every beast of the earth with you, of all that go out of the ark, every beast of the earth. 

###### 11 
Thus I establish My covenant with you: Never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of the flood; never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth." 

###### 12 
And God said: "This _is_ the sign of the covenant which I make between Me and you, and every living creature that _is_ with you, for perpetual generations: 

###### 13 
I set My rainbow in the cloud, and it shall be for the sign of the covenant between Me and the earth. 

###### 14 
It shall be, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the rainbow shall be seen in the cloud; 

###### 15 
and I will remember My covenant which _is_ between Me and you and every living creature of all flesh; the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh. 

###### 16 
The rainbow shall be in the cloud, and I will look on it to remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that _is_ on the earth." 

###### 17 
And God said to Noah, "This _is_ the sign of the covenant which I have established between Me and all flesh that _is_ on the earth." ## Noah and His Sons 

###### 18 
Now the sons of Noah who went out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. And Ham _was_ the father of Canaan. 

###### 19 
These three _were_ the sons of Noah, and from these the whole earth was populated. 

###### 20 
And Noah began _to be_ a farmer, and he planted a vineyard. 

###### 21 
Then he drank of the wine and was drunk, and became uncovered in his tent. 

###### 22 
And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside. 

###### 23 
But Shem and Japheth took a garment, laid _it_ on both their shoulders, and went backward and covered the nakedness of their father. Their faces _were_ [^b]turned away, and they did not see their father's nakedness. 

###### 24 
So Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done to him. 

###### 25 
Then he said: "Cursed _be_ Canaan; A servant of servants He shall be to his brethren." 

###### 26 
And he said: "Blessed _be_ the Lord, The God of Shem, And may Canaan be his servant. 

###### 27 
May God enlarge Japheth, And may he dwell in the tents of Shem; And may Canaan be his servant." 

###### 28 
And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years. 

###### 29 
So all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years; and he died. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

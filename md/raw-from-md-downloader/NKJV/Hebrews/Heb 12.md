# Hebrews 12

***


###### 1 
Therefore we also, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares _us,_ and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, 

###### 2 
looking unto Jesus, the [^a]author and [^b]finisher of _our_ faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. ## The Discipline of God 

###### 3 
For consider Him who endured such hostility from sinners against Himself, lest you become weary and discouraged in your souls. 

###### 4 
You have not yet resisted to bloodshed, striving against sin. 

###### 5 
And you have forgotten the exhortation which speaks to you as to sons: "My son, do not despise the [^c]chastening of the Lord, Nor be discouraged when you are rebuked by Him; 

###### 6 
For whom the Lord loves He chastens, And scourges every son whom He receives." 

###### 7 
If[^d] you endure chastening, God deals with you as with sons; for what son is there whom a father does not chasten? 

###### 8 
But if you are without chastening, of which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate and not sons. 

###### 9 
Furthermore, we have had human fathers who corrected _us,_ and we paid _them_ respect. Shall we not much more readily be in subjection to the Father of spirits and live? 

###### 10 
For they indeed for a few days chastened _us_ as seemed _best_ to them, but He for _our_ profit, that _we_ may be partakers of His holiness. 

###### 11 
Now no [^e]chastening seems to be joyful for the present, but painful; nevertheless, afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it. ## Renew Your Spiritual Vitality 

###### 12 
Therefore strengthen the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees, 

###### 13 
and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be dislocated, but rather be healed. 

###### 14 
Pursue peace with all _people,_ and holiness, without which no one will see the Lord: 

###### 15 
looking carefully lest anyone fall short of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up cause trouble, and by this many become defiled; 

###### 16 
lest there _be_ any fornicator or [^f]profane person like Esau, who for one morsel of food sold his birthright. 

###### 17 
For you know that afterward, when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for repentance, though he sought it diligently with tears. ## The Glorious Company 

###### 18 
For you have not come [^g]to the mountain that may be touched and that burned with fire, and to blackness and [^h]darkness and tempest, 

###### 19 
and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words, so that those who heard _it_ begged that the word should not be spoken to them anymore. 

###### 20 
(For they could not endure what was commanded: "And if so much as a beast touches the mountain, it shall be stoned [^i]or shot with an arrow." 

###### 21 
And so terrifying was the sight _that_ Moses said, "I am exceedingly afraid and trembling.") 

###### 22 
But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, to an innumerable company of angels, 

###### 23 
to the [^j]general assembly and church of the firstborn _who are_ registered in heaven, to God the Judge of all, to the spirits of just men made perfect, 

###### 24 
to Jesus the Mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better things than _that of_ Abel. ## Hear the Heavenly Voice 

###### 25 
See that you do not refuse Him who speaks. For if they did not escape who refused Him who spoke on earth, much more _shall we not escape_ if we turn away from Him who _speaks_ from heaven, 

###### 26 
whose voice then shook the earth; but now He has promised, saying, "Yet once more I [^k]shake not only the earth, but also heaven." 

###### 27 
Now this, "Yet once more," indicates the removal of those things that are being shaken, as of things that are made, that the things which cannot be shaken may remain. 

###### 28 
Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us have grace, by which we [^l]may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear. 

###### 29 
For our God _is_ a consuming fire. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

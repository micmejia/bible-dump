# Hebrews 7

***


###### 1 
For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, 

###### 2 
to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all, first being translated "king of righteousness," and then also king of Salem, meaning "king of peace," 

###### 3 
without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, remains a priest continually. 

###### 4 
Now consider how great this man _was,_ to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth of the [^a]spoils. 

###### 5 
And indeed those who are of the sons of Levi, who receive the priesthood, have a commandment to receive tithes from the people according to the law, that is, from their brethren, though they have come from the loins of Abraham; 

###### 6 
but he whose genealogy is not derived from them received tithes from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises. 

###### 7 
Now beyond all contradiction the lesser is blessed by the better. 

###### 8 
Here mortal men receive tithes, but there he _receives them,_ of whom it is witnessed that he lives. 

###### 9 
Even Levi, who receives tithes, paid tithes through Abraham, so to speak, 

###### 10 
for he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him. ## Need for a New Priesthood 

###### 11 
Therefore, if perfection were through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law), what further need _was there_ that another priest should rise according to the order of Melchizedek, and not be called according to the order of Aaron? 

###### 12 
For the priesthood being changed, of necessity there is also a change of the law. 

###### 13 
For He of whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe, from which no man has [^b]officiated at the altar. 

###### 14 
For _it is_ evident that our Lord arose from Judah, of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning [^c]priesthood. 

###### 15 
And it is yet far more evident if, in the likeness of Melchizedek, there arises another priest 

###### 16 
who has come, not according to the law of a fleshly commandment, but according to the power of an endless life. 

###### 17 
For [^d]He testifies: "You _are_ a priest forever According to the order of Melchizedek." 

###### 18 
For on the one hand there is an annulling of the former commandment because of its weakness and unprofitableness, 

###### 19 
for the law made nothing [^e]perfect; on the other hand, _there is the_ bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God. ## Greatness of the New Priest 

###### 20 
And inasmuch as _He was_ not _made priest_ without an oath 

###### 21 
(for they have become priests without an oath, but He with an oath by Him who said to Him: "The Lord has sworn And will not relent, 'You _are_ a priest [^f]forever According to the order of Melchizedek' "), 

###### 22 
by so much more Jesus has become a [^g]surety of a better covenant. 

###### 23 
Also there were many priests, because they were prevented by death from continuing. 

###### 24 
But He, because He continues forever, has an unchangeable priesthood. 

###### 25 
Therefore He is also able to save [^h]to the uttermost those who come to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them. 

###### 26 
For such a High Priest was fitting for us, _who is_ holy, [^i]harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and has become higher than the heavens; 

###### 27 
who does not need daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for His own sins and then for the people's, for this He did once for all when He offered up Himself. 

###### 28 
For the law appoints as high priests men who have weakness, but the word of the oath, which came after the law, _appoints_ the Son who has been perfected forever. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

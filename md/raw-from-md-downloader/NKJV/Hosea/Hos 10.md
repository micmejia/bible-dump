# Hosea 10

***


###### 1 
Israel empties _his_ vine; He brings forth fruit for himself. According to the multitude of his fruit He has increased the altars; According to the bounty of his land They have embellished _his sacred_ pillars. 

###### 2 
Their heart is divided;[^a] Now they are held guilty. He will break down their altars; He will ruin their _sacred_ pillars. 

###### 3 
For now they say, "We have no king, Because we did not fear the Lord. And as for a king, what would he do for us?" 

###### 4 
They have spoken words, Swearing falsely in making a covenant. Thus judgment springs up like hemlock in the furrows of the field. 

###### 5 
The inhabitants of Samaria fear Because of the calf[^b] of Beth Aven. For its people mourn for it, And [^c]its priests shriek for it-- Because its glory has departed from it. 

###### 6 
_The idol_ also shall be carried to Assyria _As_ a present for King Jareb. Ephraim shall receive shame, And Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel. 

###### 7 
_As for_ Samaria, her king is cut off Like a twig on the water. 

###### 8 
Also the high places of [^d]Aven, the sin of Israel, Shall be destroyed. The thorn and thistle shall grow on their altars; They shall say to the mountains, "Cover us!" And to the hills, "Fall on us!" 

###### 9 
"O Israel, you have sinned from the days of Gibeah; There they stood. The battle in Gibeah against the children of [^e]iniquity Did not [^f]overtake them. 

###### 10 
When _it is_ My desire, I will chasten them. Peoples shall be gathered against them When I bind them [^g]for their two transgressions. 

###### 11 
Ephraim _is_ a trained heifer That loves to thresh _grain;_ But I harnessed her fair neck, I will make Ephraim [^h]pull _a plow._ Judah shall plow; Jacob shall break his clods." 

###### 12 
Sow for yourselves righteousness; Reap in mercy; Break up your fallow ground, For _it is_ time to seek the Lord, Till He comes and rains righteousness on you. 

###### 13 
You have plowed wickedness; You have reaped iniquity. You have eaten the fruit of lies, Because you trusted in your own way, In the multitude of your mighty men. 

###### 14 
Therefore tumult shall arise among your people, And all your fortresses shall be plundered As Shalman plundered Beth Arbel in the day of battle-- A mother dashed in pieces upon _her_ children. 

###### 15 
Thus it shall be done to you, O Bethel, Because of your great wickedness. At dawn the king of Israel Shall be cut off utterly. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

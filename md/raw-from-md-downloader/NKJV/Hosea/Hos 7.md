# Hosea 7

***


###### 1 
"When I would have healed Israel, Then the iniquity of Ephraim was uncovered, And the wickedness of Samaria. For they have committed fraud; A thief comes in; A band of robbers [^a]takes spoil outside. 

###### 2 
They [^b]do not consider in their hearts _That_ I remember all their wickedness; Now their own deeds have surrounded them; They are before My face. 

###### 3 
They make a king glad with their wickedness, And princes with their lies. 

###### 4 
"They _are_ all adulterers. Like an oven heated by a baker-- He ceases stirring _the fire_ after kneading the dough, Until it is leavened. 

###### 5 
In the day of our king Princes have made _him_ sick, [^c]inflamed with wine; He stretched out his hand with scoffers. 

###### 6 
They prepare their heart like an oven, While they lie in wait; [^d]Their baker sleeps all night; In the morning it burns like a flaming fire. 

###### 7 
They are all hot, like an oven, And have devoured their judges; All their kings have fallen. None among them calls upon Me. 

###### 8 
"Ephraim has mixed himself among the peoples; Ephraim is a cake unturned. 

###### 9 
Aliens have devoured his strength, But he does not know _it;_ Yes, gray hairs are here and there on him, Yet he does not know _it._ 

###### 10 
And the pride of Israel testifies to his face, But they do not return to the Lord their God, Nor seek Him for all this. ## Futile Reliance on the Nations 

###### 11 
"Ephraim also is like a silly dove, without [^e]sense-- They call to Egypt, They go to Assyria. 

###### 12 
Wherever they go, I will spread My net on them; I will bring them down like birds of the air; I will chastise them According to what their congregation has heard. 

###### 13 
"Woe to them, for they have fled from Me! Destruction to them, Because they have transgressed against Me! Though I redeemed them, Yet they have spoken lies against Me. 

###### 14 
They did not cry out to Me with their heart When they wailed upon their beds. "They [^f]assemble together for grain and new wine, [^g]They rebel against Me; 

###### 15 
Though I disciplined _and_ strengthened their arms, Yet they devise evil against Me; 

###### 16 
They return, _but_ not [^h]to the Most High; They are like a treacherous bow. Their princes shall fall by the sword For the cursings of their tongue. This _shall be_ their derision in the land of Egypt. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

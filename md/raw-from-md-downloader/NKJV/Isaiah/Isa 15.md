# Isaiah 15

***


###### 1 
The burden[^a] against Moab. Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid waste _And_ destroyed, Because in the night Kir of Moab is laid waste _And_ destroyed, 

###### 2 
He has gone up to the [^b]temple and Dibon, To the high places to weep. Moab will wail over Nebo and over Medeba; On all their heads _will be_ baldness, _And_ every beard cut off. 

###### 3 
In their streets they will clothe themselves with sackcloth; On the tops of their houses And in their streets Everyone will wail, weeping bitterly. 

###### 4 
Heshbon and Elealeh will cry out, Their voice shall be heard as far as Jahaz; Therefore the [^c]armed soldiers of Moab will cry out; His life will be burdensome to him. 

###### 5 
"My heart will cry out for Moab; His fugitives _shall flee_ to Zoar, _Like_ [^d]a three-year-old heifer. For by the Ascent of Luhith They will go up with weeping; For in the way of Horonaim They will raise up a cry of destruction, 

###### 6 
For the waters of Nimrim will be desolate, For the green grass has withered away; The grass fails, there is nothing green. 

###### 7 
Therefore the abundance they have gained, And what they have laid up, They will carry away to the Brook of the Willows. 

###### 8 
For the cry has gone all around the borders of Moab, Its wailing to Eglaim And its wailing to Beer Elim. 

###### 9 
For the waters of [^e]Dimon will be full of blood; Because I will bring more upon Dimon, Lions upon him who escapes from Moab, And on the remnant of the land." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Isaiah 2

***


###### 1 
The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem. 

###### 2 
Now it shall come to pass in the latter days _That_ the mountain of the Lord's house Shall be established on the top of the mountains, And shall be exalted above the hills; And all nations shall flow to it. 

###### 3 
Many people shall come and say, "Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, To the house of the God of Jacob; He will teach us His ways, And we shall walk in His paths." For out of Zion shall go forth the law, And the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. 

###### 4 
He shall judge between the nations, And rebuke many people; They shall beat their swords into plowshares, And their spears into pruning [^a]hooks; Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, Neither shall they learn war anymore. ## The Day of the Lord 

###### 5 
O house of Jacob, come and let us walk In the light of the Lord. 

###### 6 
For You have forsaken Your people, the house of Jacob, Because they are filled with eastern ways; They _are_ soothsayers like the Philistines, And they [^b]are pleased with the children of foreigners. 

###### 7 
Their land is also full of silver and gold, And there is no end to their treasures; Their land is also full of horses, And there is no end to their chariots. 

###### 8 
Their land is also full of idols; They worship the work of their own hands, That which their own fingers have made. 

###### 9 
People bow down, And each man humbles himself; Therefore do not forgive them. 

###### 10 
Enter into the rock, and hide in the dust, From the terror of the Lord And the glory of His majesty. 

###### 11 
The [^c]lofty looks of man shall be humbled, The haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, And the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day. 

###### 12 
For the day of the Lord of hosts _Shall come_ upon everything proud and lofty, Upon everything lifted up-- And it shall be brought low-- 

###### 13 
Upon all the cedars of Lebanon _that are_ high and lifted up, And upon all the oaks of Bashan; 

###### 14 
Upon all the high mountains, And upon all the hills _that are_ lifted up; 

###### 15 
Upon every high tower, And upon every fortified wall; 

###### 16 
Upon all the ships of Tarshish, And upon all the beautiful sloops. 

###### 17 
The [^d]loftiness of man shall be bowed down, And the haughtiness of men shall be brought low; The Lord alone will be exalted in that day, 

###### 18 
But the idols [^e]He shall utterly abolish. 

###### 19 
They shall go into the holes of the rocks, And into the caves of the [^f]earth, From the terror of the Lord And the glory of His majesty, When He arises to shake the earth mightily. 

###### 20 
In that day a man will cast away his idols of silver And his idols of gold, Which they made, _each_ for himself to worship, To the moles and bats, 

###### 21 
To go into the clefts of the rocks, And into the crags of the rugged rocks, From the terror of the Lord And the glory of His majesty, When He arises to shake the earth mightily. 

###### 22 
Sever[^g] yourselves from such a man, Whose breath _is_ in his nostrils; For [^h]of what account is he? ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Isaiah 3

***


###### 1 
For behold, the Lord, the Lord of hosts, Takes away from Jerusalem and from Judah The[^a] stock and the store, The whole supply of bread and the whole supply of water; 

###### 2 
The mighty man and the man of war, The judge and the prophet, And the diviner and the elder; 

###### 3 
The captain of fifty and the [^b]honorable man, The counselor and the skillful artisan, And the expert enchanter. 

###### 4 
"I will give children[^c] _to be_ their princes, And [^d]babes shall rule over them. 

###### 5 
The people will be oppressed, Every one by another and every one by his neighbor; The child will be insolent toward the [^e]elder, And the [^f]base toward the honorable." 

###### 6 
When a man takes hold of his brother In the house of his father, _saying,_ "You have clothing; You be our ruler, And _let_ these ruins _be_ under your [^g]power," 

###### 7 
In that day he will protest, saying, "I cannot cure _your_ ills, For in my house _is_ neither food nor clothing; Do not make me a ruler of the people." 

###### 8 
For Jerusalem stumbled, And Judah is fallen, Because their tongue and their doings _Are_ against the Lord, To provoke the eyes of His glory. 

###### 9 
The look on their countenance witnesses against them, And they declare their sin as Sodom; They do not hide _it._ Woe to their soul! For they have brought evil upon themselves. 

###### 10 
"Say to the righteous that _it shall be_ well _with them,_ For they shall eat the fruit of their doings. 

###### 11 
Woe to the wicked! _It shall be_ ill _with him,_ For the reward of his hands shall be [^h]given him. 

###### 12 
_As for_ My people, children _are_ their oppressors, And women rule over them. O My people! Those who lead you [^i]cause _you_ to err, And destroy the way of your paths." ## Oppression and Luxury Condemned 

###### 13 
The Lord stands up to [^j]plead, And stands to judge the people. 

###### 14 
The Lord will enter into judgment With the elders of His people And His princes: "For you have [^k]eaten up the vineyard; The plunder of the poor _is_ in your houses. 

###### 15 
What do you mean by crushing My people And grinding the faces of the poor?" Says the Lord God of hosts. 

###### 16 
Moreover the Lord says: "Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, And walk with [^l]outstretched necks And [^m]wanton eyes, Walking and [^n]mincing _as_ they go, Making a jingling with their feet, 

###### 17 
Therefore the Lord will strike with a scab The crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, And the Lord will uncover their secret parts." 

###### 18 
In that day the Lord will take away the finery: The jingling anklets, the [^o]scarves, and the crescents; 

###### 19 
The pendants, the bracelets, and the veils; 

###### 20 
The headdresses, the leg ornaments, and the headbands; The perfume boxes, the charms, 

###### 21 
and the rings; The nose jewels, 

###### 22 
the festal apparel, and the mantles; The outer garments, the purses, 

###### 23 
and the mirrors; The fine linen, the turbans, and the robes. 

###### 24 
And so it shall be: Instead of a sweet smell there will be a stench; Instead of a sash, a rope; Instead of well-set hair, baldness; Instead of a rich robe, a girding of sackcloth; And [^p]branding instead of beauty. 

###### 25 
Your men shall fall by the sword, And your [^q]mighty in the war. 

###### 26 
Her gates shall lament and mourn, And she _being_ desolate shall sit on the ground. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

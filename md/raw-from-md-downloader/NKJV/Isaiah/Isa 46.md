# Isaiah 46

***


###### 1 
Bel bows down, Nebo stoops; Their idols were on the beasts and on the cattle. Your carriages _were_ heavily loaded, A burden to the weary _beast._ 

###### 2 
They stoop, they bow down together; They could not deliver the burden, But have themselves gone into captivity. 

###### 3 
"Listen to Me, O house of Jacob, And all the remnant of the house of Israel, Who have been upheld _by Me_ from [^a]birth, Who have been carried from the womb: 

###### 4 
Even to _your_ old age, I _am_ He, And _even_ to gray hairs I will carry _you!_ I have made, and I will bear; Even I will carry, and will deliver _you._ 

###### 5 
"To whom will you liken Me, and make _Me_ equal And compare Me, that we should be alike? 

###### 6 
They lavish gold out of the bag, And weigh silver on the scales; They hire a goldsmith, and he makes it a god; They prostrate themselves, yes, they worship. 

###### 7 
They bear it on the shoulder, they carry it And set it in its place, and it stands; From its place it shall not move. Though _one_ cries out to it, yet it cannot answer Nor save him out of his trouble. 

###### 8 
"Remember this, and [^b]show yourselves men; Recall to mind, O you transgressors. 

###### 9 
Remember the former things of old, For I _am_ God, and _there is_ no other; _I am_ God, and _there is_ none like Me, 

###### 10 
Declaring the end from the beginning, And from ancient times _things_ that are not _yet_ done, Saying, 'My counsel shall stand, And I will do all My pleasure,' 

###### 11 
Calling a bird of prey from the east, The man who executes My counsel, from a far country. Indeed I have spoken _it;_ I will also bring it to pass. I have purposed _it;_ I will also do it. 

###### 12 
"Listen to Me, you stubborn-hearted, Who _are_ far from righteousness: 

###### 13 
I bring My righteousness near, it shall not be far off; My salvation shall not [^c]linger. And I will place salvation in Zion, For Israel My glory. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

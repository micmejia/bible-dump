# Isaiah 57

***


###### 1 
The righteous perishes, And no man takes _it_ to heart; Merciful men _are_ taken away, While no one considers That the righteous is taken away from [^a]evil. 

###### 2 
He shall enter into peace; They shall rest in their beds, _Each one_ walking _in_ his uprightness. 

###### 3 
"But come here, You sons of the sorceress, You offspring of the adulterer and the harlot! 

###### 4 
Whom do you ridicule? Against whom do you make a wide mouth _And_ stick out the tongue? _Are_ you not children of transgression, Offspring of falsehood, 

###### 5 
Inflaming yourselves with gods under every green tree, Slaying the children in the valleys, Under the clefts of the rocks? 

###### 6 
Among the smooth _stones_ of the stream _Is_ your portion; They, they, _are_ your lot! Even to them you have poured a drink offering, You have offered a grain offering. Should I receive comfort in these? 

###### 7 
"On a lofty and high mountain You have set your bed; Even there you went up To offer sacrifice. 

###### 8 
Also behind the doors and their posts You have set up your remembrance; For you have uncovered yourself _to those other_ than Me, And have gone up to them; You have enlarged your bed And [^b]made _a covenant_ with them; You have loved their bed, Where you saw _their_ [^c]nudity. 

###### 9 
You went to the king with ointment, And increased your perfumes; You sent your messengers far off, And _even_ descended to Sheol. 

###### 10 
You are wearied in the length of your way; _Yet_ you did not say, 'There is no hope.' You have found the life of your hand; Therefore you were not grieved. 

###### 11 
"And of whom have you been afraid, or feared, That you have lied And not remembered Me, Nor taken _it_ to your heart? Is it not because I have [^d]held My peace from of old That you do not fear Me? 

###### 12 
I will declare your righteousness And your works, For they will not profit you. 

###### 13 
When you cry out, Let your collection _of idols_ deliver you. But the wind will carry them all away, A breath will take _them._ But he who puts his trust in Me shall possess the land, And shall inherit My holy mountain." ## Healing for the Backslider 

###### 14 
And one shall say, "Heap it up! Heap it up! Prepare the way, Take the stumbling block out of the way of My people." 

###### 15 
For thus says the High and Lofty One Who inhabits eternity, whose name _is_ Holy: "I dwell in the high and holy _place,_ With him _who_ has a contrite and humble spirit, To revive the spirit of the humble, And to revive the heart of the contrite ones. 

###### 16 
For I will not contend forever, Nor will I always be angry; For the spirit would fail before Me, And the souls _which_ I have made. 

###### 17 
For the iniquity of his covetousness I was angry and struck him; I hid and was angry, And he went on [^e]backsliding in the way of his heart. 

###### 18 
I have seen his ways, and will heal him; I will also lead him, And restore comforts to him And to his mourners. 

###### 19 
"I create the fruit of the lips: Peace, peace to _him who is_ far off and to _him who is_ near," Says the Lord, "And I will heal him." 

###### 20 
But the wicked _are_ like the troubled sea, When it cannot rest, Whose waters cast up mire and dirt. 

###### 21 
"_There_ _is_ no peace," Says my God, "for the wicked." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Isaiah 58

***


###### 1 
"Cry aloud, [^a]spare not; Lift up your voice like a trumpet; Tell My people their transgression, And the house of Jacob their sins. 

###### 2 
Yet they seek Me daily, And delight to know My ways, As a nation that did righteousness, And did not forsake the ordinance of their God. They ask of Me the ordinances of justice; They take delight in approaching God. 

###### 3 
'Why have we fasted,' _they say,_ 'and You have not seen? _Why_ have we afflicted our souls, and You take no notice?' "In fact, in the day of your fast you find pleasure, And [^b]exploit all your laborers. 

###### 4 
Indeed you fast for strife and debate, And to strike with the fist of wickedness. You will not fast as _you do_ this day, To make your voice heard on high. 

###### 5 
Is it a fast that I have chosen, A day for a man to afflict his soul? _Is it_ to bow down his head like a bulrush, And to spread out sackcloth and ashes? Would you call this a fast, And an acceptable day to the Lord? 

###### 6 
"_Is_ this not the fast that I have chosen: To loose the bonds of wickedness, To undo the [^c]heavy burdens, To let the oppressed go free, And that you break every yoke? 

###### 7 
_Is it_ not to share your bread with the hungry, And that you bring to your house the poor who are [^d]cast out; When you see the naked, that you cover him, And not hide yourself from your own flesh? 

###### 8 
Then your light shall break forth like the morning, Your healing shall spring forth speedily, And your righteousness shall go before you; The glory of the Lord shall be your rear guard. 

###### 9 
Then you shall call, and the Lord will answer; You shall cry, and He will say, 'Here I _am._' "If you take away the yoke from your midst, The [^e]pointing of the finger, and speaking wickedness, 

###### 10 
_If_ you extend your soul to the hungry And satisfy the afflicted soul, Then your light shall dawn in the darkness, And your [^f]darkness shall _be_ as the noonday. 

###### 11 
The Lord will guide you continually, And satisfy your soul in drought, And strengthen your bones; You shall be like a watered garden, And like a spring of water, whose waters do not fail. 

###### 12 
Those from among you Shall build the old waste places; You shall raise up the foundations of many generations; And you shall be called the Repairer of the Breach, The Restorer of [^g]Streets to Dwell In. 

###### 13 
"If you turn away your foot from the Sabbath, _From_ doing your pleasure on My holy day, And call the Sabbath a delight, The holy _day_ of the Lord honorable, And shall honor Him, not doing your own ways, Nor finding your own pleasure, Nor speaking _your own_ words, 

###### 14 
Then you shall delight yourself in the Lord; And I will cause you to ride on the high hills of the earth, And feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father. The mouth of the Lord has spoken." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

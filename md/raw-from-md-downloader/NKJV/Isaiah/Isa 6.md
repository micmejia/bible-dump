# Isaiah 6

***


###### 1 
In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and the train of His _robe_ filled the temple. 

###### 2 
Above it stood seraphim; each one had six wings: with two he covered his face, with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. 

###### 3 
And one cried to another and said: "Holy, holy, holy _is_ the Lord of hosts; The whole earth _is_ full of His glory!" 

###### 4 
And the posts of the door were shaken by the voice of him who cried out, and the house was filled with smoke. 

###### 5 
So I said: "Woe _is_ me, for I am [^a]undone! Because I _am_ a man of unclean lips, And I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; For my eyes have seen the King, The Lord of hosts." 

###### 6 
Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a live coal _which_ he had taken with the tongs from the altar. 

###### 7 
And he touched my mouth _with it,_ and said: "Behold, this has touched your lips; Your iniquity is taken away, And your sin [^b]purged." 

###### 8 
Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying: "Whom shall I send, And who will go for Us?" Then I said, "Here _am_ I! Send me." 

###### 9 
And He said, "Go, and tell this people: 'Keep on hearing, but do not understand; Keep on seeing, but do not perceive.' 

###### 10 
"Make the heart of this people dull, And their ears heavy, And shut their eyes; Lest they see with their eyes, And hear with their ears, And understand with their heart, And return and be healed." 

###### 11 
Then I said, "Lord, how long?" And He answered: "Until the cities are laid waste and without inhabitant, The houses are without a man, The land is utterly desolate, 

###### 12 
The Lord has removed men far away, And the forsaken places _are_ many in the midst of the land. 

###### 13 
But yet a tenth _will be_ in it, And will return and be for consuming, As a terebinth tree or as an oak, Whose stump _remains_ when it is cut down. So the holy seed _shall be_ its stump." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

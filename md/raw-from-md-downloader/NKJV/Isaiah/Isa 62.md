# Isaiah 62

***


###### 1 
For Zion's sake I will not [^a]hold My peace, And for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, Until her righteousness goes forth as brightness, And her salvation as a lamp _that_ burns. 

###### 2 
The Gentiles shall see your righteousness, And all kings your glory. You shall be called by a new name, Which the mouth of the Lord will name. 

###### 3 
You shall also be a crown of glory In the hand of the Lord, And a royal diadem In the hand of your God. 

###### 4 
You shall no longer be termed Forsaken,[^b] Nor shall your land any more be termed Desolate;[^c] But you shall be called [^d]Hephzibah, and your land [^e]Beulah; For the Lord delights in you, And your land shall be married. 

###### 5 
For _as_ a young man marries a virgin, _So_ shall your sons marry you; And _as_ the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, _So_ shall your God rejoice over you. 

###### 6 
I have set watchmen on your walls, O Jerusalem; They shall [^f]never hold their peace day or night. You who [^g]make mention of the Lord, do not keep silent, 

###### 7 
And give Him no rest till He establishes And till He makes Jerusalem a praise in the earth. 

###### 8 
The Lord has sworn by His right hand And by the arm of His strength: "Surely I will no longer give your grain _As_ food for your enemies; And the sons of the foreigner shall not drink your new wine, For which you have labored. 

###### 9 
But those who have gathered it shall eat it, And praise the Lord; Those who have brought it together shall drink it in My holy courts." 

###### 10 
Go through, Go through the gates! Prepare the way for the people; Build up, Build up the highway! Take out the stones, Lift up a banner for the peoples! 

###### 11 
Indeed the Lord has proclaimed To the end of the world: "Say to the daughter of Zion, 'Surely your salvation is coming; Behold, His reward _is_ with Him, And His [^h]work before Him.' " 

###### 12 
And they shall call them The Holy People, The Redeemed of the Lord; And you shall be called Sought Out, A City Not Forsaken. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

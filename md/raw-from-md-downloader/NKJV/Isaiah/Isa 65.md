# Isaiah 65

***


###### 1 
"I was sought by _those who_ did not ask _for Me;_ I was found by _those who_ did not seek Me. I said, 'Here I am, here I am,' To a nation _that_ was not called by My name. 

###### 2 
I have stretched out My hands all day long to a rebellious people, Who walk in a way _that is_ not good, According to their own thoughts; 

###### 3 
A people who provoke Me to anger continually to My face; Who sacrifice in gardens, And burn incense on altars of brick; 

###### 4 
Who sit among the graves, And spend the night in the tombs; Who eat swine's flesh, And the broth of [^a]abominable things is _in_ their vessels; 

###### 5 
Who say, 'Keep to yourself, Do not come near me, For I am holier than you!' These [^b]_are_ smoke in My nostrils, A fire that burns all the day. 

###### 6 
"Behold, _it is_ written before Me: I will not keep silence, but will repay-- Even repay into their bosom-- 

###### 7 
Your iniquities and the iniquities of your fathers together," Says the Lord, "Who have burned incense on the mountains And blasphemed Me on the hills; Therefore I will measure their former work into their bosom." 

###### 8 
Thus says the Lord: "As the new wine is found in the cluster, And _one_ says, 'Do not destroy it, For a blessing _is_ in it,' So will I do for My servants' sake, That I may not destroy them all. 

###### 9 
I will bring forth descendants from Jacob, And from Judah an heir of My mountains; My elect shall inherit it, And My servants shall dwell there. 

###### 10 
Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, And the Valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down, For My people who have sought Me. 

###### 11 
"But you _are_ those who forsake the Lord, Who forget My holy mountain, Who prepare a table for [^c]Gad, And who furnish a drink offering for [^d]Meni. 

###### 12 
Therefore I will number you for the sword, And you shall all bow down to the slaughter; Because, when I called, you did not answer; When I spoke, you did not hear, But did evil before My eyes, And chose _that_ in which I do not delight." 

###### 13 
Therefore thus says the Lord God: "Behold, My servants shall eat, But you shall be hungry; Behold, My servants shall drink, But you shall be thirsty; Behold, My servants shall rejoice, But you shall be ashamed; 

###### 14 
Behold, My servants shall sing for joy of heart, But you shall cry for sorrow of heart, And wail for [^e]grief of spirit. 

###### 15 
You shall leave your name as a curse to My chosen; For the Lord God will slay you, And call His servants by another name; 

###### 16 
So that he who blesses himself in the earth Shall bless himself in the God of truth; And he who swears in the earth Shall swear by the God of truth; Because the former troubles are forgotten, And because they are hidden from My eyes. ## The Glorious New Creation 

###### 17 
"For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; And the former shall not be remembered or [^f]come to mind. 

###### 18 
But be glad and rejoice forever in what I create; For behold, I create Jerusalem _as_ a rejoicing, And her people a joy. 

###### 19 
I will rejoice in Jerusalem, And joy in My people; The voice of weeping shall no longer be heard in her, Nor the voice of crying. 

###### 20 
"No more shall an infant from there _live but a few_ days, Nor an old man who has not fulfilled his days; For the child shall die one hundred years old, But the sinner _being_ one hundred years old shall be accursed. 

###### 21 
They shall build houses and inhabit _them;_ They shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit. 

###### 22 
They shall not build and another inhabit; They shall not plant and another eat; For as the days of a tree, _so shall be_ the days of My people, And My elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands. 

###### 23 
They shall not labor in vain, Nor bring forth children for trouble; For they _shall be_ the descendants of the blessed of the Lord, And their offspring with them. 

###### 24 
"It shall come to pass That before they call, I will answer; And while they are still speaking, I will hear. 

###### 25 
The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, The lion shall eat straw like the ox, And dust _shall be_ the serpent's food. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain," Says the Lord. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

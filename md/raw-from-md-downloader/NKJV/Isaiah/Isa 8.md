# Isaiah 8

***


###### 1 
Moreover the Lord said to me, "Take a large scroll, and write on it with a man's pen concerning [^a]Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz. 

###### 2 
And I will take for Myself faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah." 

###### 3 
Then I went to the prophetess, and she conceived and bore a son. Then the Lord said to me, "Call his name Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz; 

###### 4 
for before the child [^b]shall have knowledge to cry 'My father' and 'My mother,' the riches of Damascus and the [^c]spoil of Samaria will be taken away before the king of Assyria." 

###### 5 
The Lord also spoke to me again, saying: 

###### 6 
"Inasmuch as these people refused The waters of Shiloah that flow softly, And rejoice in Rezin and in Remaliah's son; 

###### 7 
Now therefore, behold, the Lord brings up over them The waters of [^d]the River, strong and mighty-- The king of Assyria and all his glory; He will [^e]go up over all his channels And go over all his banks. 

###### 8 
He will pass through Judah, He will overflow and pass over, He will reach up to the neck; And the stretching out of his wings Will [^f]fill the breadth of Your land, O Immanuel.[^g] 

###### 9 
"Be shattered, O you peoples, and be broken in pieces! Give ear, all you from far countries. Gird yourselves, but be broken in pieces; Gird yourselves, but be broken in pieces. 

###### 10 
Take counsel together, but it will come to nothing; Speak the word, but it will not stand, For [^h]God _is_ with us." ## Fear God, Heed His Word 

###### 11 
For the Lord spoke thus to me with [^i]a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying: 

###### 12 
"Do not say, 'A conspiracy,' Concerning all that this people call a conspiracy, Nor be afraid of their [^j]threats, nor be [^k]troubled. 

###### 13 
The Lord of hosts, Him you shall hallow; _Let_ Him _be_ your fear, And _let_ Him _be_ your dread. 

###### 14 
He will be as a [^l]sanctuary, But a stone of stumbling and a rock of [^m]offense To both the houses of Israel, As a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 

###### 15 
And many among them shall stumble; They shall fall and be broken, Be snared and [^n]taken." 

###### 16 
Bind up the testimony, Seal the law among my disciples. 

###### 17 
And I will wait on the Lord, Who hides His face from the house of Jacob; And I will hope in Him. 

###### 18 
Here am I and the children whom the Lord has given me! _We_ are for signs and wonders in Israel From the Lord of hosts, Who dwells in Mount Zion. 

###### 19 
And when they say to you, "Seek those who are mediums and wizards, who whisper and mutter," should not a people seek their God? _Should they_ _seek_ the dead on behalf of the living? 

###### 20 
To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, _it is_ because _there_[^o] _is_ no light in them. 

###### 21 
They will pass through it hard-pressed and hungry; and it shall happen, when they are hungry, that they will be enraged and curse [^p]their king and their God, and look upward. 

###### 22 
Then they will look to the earth, and see trouble and darkness, gloom of anguish; and _they will be_ driven into darkness. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

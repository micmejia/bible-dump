# James 1

***


###### 1 
James, a bondservant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, To the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad: Greetings. ## Profiting from Trials 

###### 2 
My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials, 

###### 3 
knowing that the testing of your faith produces [^a]patience. 

###### 4 
But let patience have _its_ perfect work, that you may be [^b]perfect and complete, lacking nothing. 

###### 5 
If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him. 

###### 6 
But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven and tossed by the wind. 

###### 7 
For let not that man suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord; 

###### 8 
_he is_ a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways. ## The Perspective of Rich and Poor 

###### 9 
Let the lowly brother glory in his exaltation, 

###### 10 
but the rich in his humiliation, because as a flower of the field he will pass away. 

###### 11 
For no sooner has the sun risen with a burning heat than it withers the grass; its flower falls, and its beautiful appearance perishes. So the rich man also will fade away in his pursuits. ## Loving God Under Trials 

###### 12 
Blessed _is_ the man who endures temptation; for when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him. 

###### 13 
Let no one say when he is tempted, "I am tempted by God"; for God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He Himself tempt anyone. 

###### 14 
But each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires and enticed. 

###### 15 
Then, when desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, brings forth death. 

###### 16 
Do not be deceived, my beloved brethren. 

###### 17 
Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow of turning. 

###### 18 
Of His own will He brought us forth by the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures. ## Qualities Needed in Trials 

###### 19 
[^c]So then, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath; 

###### 20 
for the wrath of man does not produce the righteousness of God. ## Doers--Not Hearers Only 

###### 21 
Therefore lay aside all filthiness and [^d]overflow of wickedness, and receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls. 

###### 22 
But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. 

###### 23 
For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man observing his natural face in a mirror; 

###### 24 
for he observes himself, goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man he was. 

###### 25 
But he who looks into the perfect law of liberty and continues _in it,_ and is not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work, this one will be blessed in what he does. 

###### 26 
If anyone [^e]among you thinks he is religious, and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his own heart, this one's religion _is_ useless. 

###### 27 
Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their trouble, _and_ to keep oneself unspotted from the world. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

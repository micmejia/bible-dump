# James 3

***


###### 1 
My brethren, let not many of you become teachers, knowing that we shall receive a stricter judgment. 

###### 2 
For we all stumble in many things. If anyone does not stumble in word, he _is_ a [^a]perfect man, able also to bridle the whole body. 

###### 3 
[^b]Indeed, we put bits in horses' mouths that they may obey us, and we turn their whole body. 

###### 4 
Look also at ships: although they are so large and are driven by fierce winds, they are turned by a very small rudder wherever the pilot desires. 

###### 5 
Even so the tongue is a little member and boasts great things. See how great a forest a little fire kindles! 

###### 6 
And the tongue _is_ a fire, a world of [^c]iniquity. The tongue is so set among our members that it defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of [^d]nature; and it is set on fire by [^e]hell. 

###### 7 
For every kind of beast and bird, of reptile and creature of the sea, is tamed and has been tamed by mankind. 

###### 8 
But no man can tame the tongue. _It is_ an unruly evil, full of deadly poison. 

###### 9 
With it we bless our God and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in the [^f]similitude of God. 

###### 10 
Out of the same mouth proceed blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not to be so. 

###### 11 
Does a spring send forth fresh _water_ and bitter from the same opening? 

###### 12 
Can a fig tree, my brethren, bear olives, or a grapevine bear figs? [^g]Thus no spring yields both salt water and fresh. ## Heavenly Versus Demonic Wisdom 

###### 13 
Who _is_ wise and understanding among you? Let him show by good conduct _that_ his works _are done_ in the meekness of wisdom. 

###### 14 
But if you have bitter envy and [^h]self-seeking in your hearts, do not boast and lie against the truth. 

###### 15 
This wisdom does not descend from above, but _is_ earthly, sensual, demonic. 

###### 16 
For where envy and self-seeking _exist,_ confusion and every evil thing _are_ there. 

###### 17 
But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, willing to yield, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy. 

###### 18 
Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

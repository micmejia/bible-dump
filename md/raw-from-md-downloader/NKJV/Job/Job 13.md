# Job 13

***


###### 1 
"Behold, my eye has seen all _this,_ My ear has heard and understood it. 

###### 2 
What you know, I also know; I _am_ not inferior to you. 

###### 3 
But I would speak to the Almighty, And I desire to reason with God. 

###### 4 
But you forgers of lies, You _are_ all worthless physicians. 

###### 5 
Oh, that you would be silent, And it would be your wisdom! 

###### 6 
Now hear my reasoning, And heed the pleadings of my lips. 

###### 7 
Will you speak [^a]wickedly for God, And talk deceitfully for Him? 

###### 8 
Will you show partiality for Him? Will you contend for God? 

###### 9 
Will it be well when He searches you out? Or can you mock Him as one mocks a man? 

###### 10 
He will surely rebuke you If you secretly show partiality. 

###### 11 
Will not His [^b]excellence make you afraid, And the dread of Him fall upon you? 

###### 12 
Your platitudes _are_ proverbs of ashes, Your defenses are defenses of clay. 

###### 13 
"Hold[^c] your peace with me, and let me speak, Then let come on me what _may!_ 

###### 14 
Why do I take my flesh in my teeth, And put my life in my hands? 

###### 15 
Though He slay me, yet will I trust Him. Even so, I will defend my own ways before Him. 

###### 16 
He also _shall_ be my salvation, For a hypocrite could not come before Him. 

###### 17 
Listen carefully to my speech, And to my declaration with your ears. 

###### 18 
See now, I have prepared _my_ case, I know that I shall be vindicated. 

###### 19 
Who _is_ he _who_ will contend with me? If now I hold my tongue, I perish. ## Job's Despondent Prayer 

###### 20 
"Only two _things_ do not do to me, Then I will not hide myself from You: 

###### 21 
Withdraw Your hand far from me, And let not the dread of You make me afraid. 

###### 22 
Then call, and I will answer; Or let me speak, then You respond to me. 

###### 23 
How many _are_ my iniquities and sins? Make me know my transgression and my sin. 

###### 24 
Why do You hide Your face, And regard me as Your enemy? 

###### 25 
Will You frighten a leaf driven to and fro? And will You pursue dry stubble? 

###### 26 
For You write bitter things against me, And make me inherit the iniquities of my youth. 

###### 27 
You put my feet in the stocks, And watch closely all my paths. You [^d]set a limit for the [^e]soles of my feet. 

###### 28

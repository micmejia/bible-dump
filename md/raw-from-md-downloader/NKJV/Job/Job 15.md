# Job 15

***


###### 1 
Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said: 

###### 2 
"Should a wise man answer with empty knowledge, And fill [^a]himself with the east wind? 

###### 3 
Should he reason with unprofitable talk, Or by speeches with which he can do no good? 

###### 4 
Yes, you cast off fear, And restrain [^b]prayer before God. 

###### 5 
For your iniquity teaches your mouth, And you choose the tongue of the crafty. 

###### 6 
Your own mouth condemns you, and not I; Yes, your own lips testify against you. 

###### 7 
"_Are_ you the first man _who_ was born? Or were you made before the hills? 

###### 8 
Have you heard the counsel of God? Do you limit wisdom to yourself? 

###### 9 
What do you know that we do not know? _What_ do you understand that _is_ not in us? 

###### 10 
Both the gray-haired and the aged _are_ among us, Much older than your father. 

###### 11 
_Are_ the consolations of God too small for you, And the word _spoken_ [^c]gently with you? 

###### 12 
Why does your heart carry you away, And [^d]what do your eyes wink at, 

###### 13 
That you turn your spirit against God, And let _such_ words go out of your mouth? 

###### 14 
"What _is_ man, that he could be pure? And _he who is_ born of a woman, that he could be righteous? 

###### 15 
If _God_ puts no trust in His saints, And the heavens are not pure in His sight, 

###### 16 
How much less man, _who is_ abominable and filthy, Who drinks iniquity like water! 

###### 17 
"I will tell you, hear me; What I have seen I will declare, 

###### 18 
What wise men have told, Not hiding _anything received_ from their fathers, 

###### 19 
To whom alone the [^e]land was given, And no alien passed among them: 

###### 20 
The wicked man writhes with pain all _his_ days, And the number of years is hidden from the oppressor. 

###### 21 
[^f]Dreadful sounds _are_ in his ears; In prosperity the destroyer comes upon him. 

###### 22 
He does not believe that he will return from darkness, For a sword is waiting for him. 

###### 23 
He wanders about for bread, _saying,_ 'Where _is it?_' He knows that a day of darkness is ready at his hand. 

###### 24 
Trouble and anguish make him afraid; They overpower him, like a king ready for [^g]battle. 

###### 25 
For he stretches out his hand against God, And acts defiantly against the Almighty, 

###### 26 
Running stubbornly against Him With his strong, embossed shield. 

###### 27 
"Though he has covered his face with his fatness, And made _his_ waist heavy with fat, 

###### 28 
He dwells in desolate cities, In houses which no one inhabits, Which are destined to become ruins. 

###### 29 
He will not be rich, Nor will his wealth continue, Nor will his possessions overspread the earth. 

###### 30 
He will not depart from darkness; The flame will dry out his branches, And by the breath of His mouth he will go away. 

###### 31 
Let him not trust in futile _things,_ deceiving himself, For futility will be his reward. 

###### 32 
It will be accomplished before his time, And his branch will not be green. 

###### 33 
He will shake off his unripe grape like a vine, And cast off his blossom like an olive tree. 

###### 34 
For the company of hypocrites _will be_ barren, And fire will consume the tents of bribery. 

###### 35 
They conceive trouble and bring forth futility; Their womb prepares deceit." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

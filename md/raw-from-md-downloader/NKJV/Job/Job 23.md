# Job 23

***


###### 1 
Then Job answered and said: 

###### 2 
"Even today my complaint is bitter; [^a]My hand is listless because of my groaning. 

###### 3 
Oh, that I knew where I might find Him, _That_ I might come to His seat! 

###### 4 
I would present _my_ case before Him, And fill my mouth with arguments. 

###### 5 
I would know the words _which_ He would answer me, And understand what He would say to me. 

###### 6 
Would He contend with me in His great power? No! But He would take _note_ of me. 

###### 7 
There the upright could reason with Him, And I would be delivered forever from my Judge. 

###### 8 
"Look, I go forward, but He is not _there,_ And backward, but I cannot perceive Him; 

###### 9 
When He works on the left hand, I cannot behold _Him;_ When He turns to the right hand, I cannot see _Him._ 

###### 10 
But He knows the way that I take; _When_ He has tested me, I shall come forth as gold. 

###### 11 
My foot has held fast to His steps; I have kept His way and not turned aside. 

###### 12 
I have not departed from the commandment of His lips; I have treasured the words of His mouth More than my [^b]necessary _food._ 

###### 13 
"But He _is_ unique, and who can make Him change? And _whatever_ His soul desires, _that_ He does. 

###### 14 
For He performs _what is_ appointed for me, And many such _things are_ with Him. 

###### 15 
Therefore I am terrified at His presence; When I consider _this,_ I am afraid of Him. 

###### 16 
For God made my heart weak, And the Almighty terrifies me; 

###### 17 
Because I was not cut off [^c]from the presence of darkness, And He did _not_ hide deep darkness from my face. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

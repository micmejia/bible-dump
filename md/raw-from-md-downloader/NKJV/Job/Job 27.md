# Job 27

***


###### 1 
Moreover Job continued his discourse, and said: 

###### 2 
"_As_ God lives, _who_ has taken away my justice, And the Almighty, _who_ has made my soul bitter, 

###### 3 
As long as my breath _is_ in me, And the breath of God in my nostrils, 

###### 4 
My lips will not speak wickedness, Nor my tongue utter deceit. 

###### 5 
Far be it from me That I should say you are right; Till I die I will not put away my integrity from me. 

###### 6 
My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go; My heart shall not [^a]reproach _me_ as long as I live. 

###### 7 
"May my enemy be like the wicked, And he who rises up against me like the unrighteous. 

###### 8 
For what is the hope of the hypocrite, Though he may gain _much,_ If God takes away his life? 

###### 9 
Will God hear his cry When trouble comes upon him? 

###### 10 
Will he delight himself in the Almighty? Will he always call on God? 

###### 11 
"I will teach you [^b]about the hand of God; What _is_ with the Almighty I will not conceal. 

###### 12 
Surely all of you have seen _it;_ Why then do you behave with complete nonsense? 

###### 13 
"This is the portion of a wicked man with God, And the heritage of oppressors, received from the Almighty: 

###### 14 
If his children are multiplied, _it is_ for the sword; And his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread. 

###### 15 
Those who survive him shall be buried in death, And their[^c] widows shall not weep, 

###### 16 
Though he heaps up silver like dust, And piles up clothing like clay-- 

###### 17 
He may pile _it_ up, but the just will wear _it,_ And the innocent will divide the silver. 

###### 18 
He builds his house like a [^d]moth, Like a [^e]booth _which_ a watchman makes. 

###### 19 
The rich man will lie down, [^f]But not be gathered _up;_ He opens his eyes, And he _is_ no more. 

###### 20 
Terrors overtake him like a flood; A tempest steals him away in the night. 

###### 21 
The east wind carries him away, and he is gone; It sweeps him out of his place. 

###### 22 
It hurls against him and does not spare; He flees desperately from its [^g]power. 

###### 23 
_Men_ shall clap their hands at him, And shall hiss him out of his place. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

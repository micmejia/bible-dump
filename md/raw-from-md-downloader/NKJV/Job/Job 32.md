# Job 32

***


###### 1 
So these three men ceased answering Job, because he _was_ righteous in his own eyes. 

###### 2 
Then the wrath of Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, was aroused against Job; his wrath was aroused because he justified himself rather than God. 

###### 3 
Also against his three friends his wrath was aroused, because they had found no answer, and _yet_ had condemned Job. 

###### 4 
Now because they _were_ years older than he, Elihu had waited [^a]to speak to Job. 

###### 5 
When Elihu saw that _there was_ no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was aroused. 

###### 6 
So Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, answered and said: "I _am_ young in years, and you _are_ very old; Therefore I was afraid, And dared not declare my opinion to you. 

###### 7 
I said, [^b]'Age should speak, And multitude of years should teach wisdom.' 

###### 8 
But _there is_ a spirit in man, And the breath of the Almighty gives him understanding. 

###### 9 
Great[^c] men are not _always_ wise, Nor do the aged _always_ understand justice. 

###### 10 
"Therefore I say, 'Listen to me, I also will declare my opinion.' 

###### 11 
Indeed I waited for your words, I listened to your reasonings, while you searched out what to say. 

###### 12 
I paid close attention to you; And surely not one of you convinced Job, _Or_ answered his words-- 

###### 13 
Lest you say, 'We have found wisdom'; God will vanquish him, not man. 

###### 14 
Now he has not [^d]directed _his_ words against me; So I will not answer him with your words. 

###### 15 
"They are dismayed and answer no more; Words escape them. 

###### 16 
And I have waited, because they did not speak, Because they stood still _and_ answered no more. 

###### 17 
I also will answer my part, I too will declare my opinion. 

###### 18 
For I am full of words; The spirit within me compels me. 

###### 19 
Indeed my [^e]belly _is_ like wine _that_ has no [^f]vent; It is ready to burst like new wineskins. 

###### 20 
I will speak, that I may find relief; I must open my lips and answer. 

###### 21 
Let me not, I pray, show partiality to anyone; Nor let me flatter any man. 

###### 22 
For I do not know how to flatter, _Else_ my Maker would soon take me away. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

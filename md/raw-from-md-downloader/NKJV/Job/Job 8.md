# Job 8

***


###### 1 
Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said: 

###### 2 
"How long will you speak these _things,_ And the words of your mouth _be like_ a strong wind? 

###### 3 
Does God subvert judgment? Or does the Almighty pervert justice? 

###### 4 
If your sons have sinned against Him, He has cast them away [^a]for their transgression. 

###### 5 
If you would earnestly seek God And make your supplication to the Almighty, 

###### 6 
If you _were_ pure and upright, Surely now He would [^b]awake for you, And prosper your rightful dwelling place. 

###### 7 
Though your beginning was small, Yet your latter end would increase abundantly. 

###### 8 
"For inquire, please, of the former age, And consider the things discovered by their fathers; 

###### 9 
For we _were born_ yesterday, and know [^c]nothing, Because our days on earth _are_ a shadow. 

###### 10 
Will they not teach you and tell you, And utter words from their heart? 

###### 11 
"Can the papyrus grow up without a marsh? Can the reeds flourish without water? 

###### 12 
While it _is_ yet green _and_ not cut down, It withers before any _other_ plant. 

###### 13 
So _are_ the paths of all who forget God; And the hope of the hypocrite shall perish, 

###### 14 
Whose confidence shall be cut off, And whose trust _is_ [^d]a spider's web. 

###### 15 
He leans on his house, but it does not stand. He holds it fast, but it does not endure. 

###### 16 
He grows green in the sun, And his branches spread out in his garden. 

###### 17 
His roots wrap around the rock heap, _And_ look for a place in the stones. 

###### 18 
If he is destroyed from his place, Then _it_ will deny him, _saying,_ 'I have not seen you.' 

###### 19 
"Behold, this is the joy of His way, And out of the earth others will grow. 

###### 20 
Behold, God will not [^e]cast away the blameless, Nor will He uphold the evildoers. 

###### 21 
He will yet fill your mouth with laughing, And your lips with [^f]rejoicing. 

###### 22 
Those who hate you will be clothed with shame, And the dwelling place of the wicked [^g]will come to nothing." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

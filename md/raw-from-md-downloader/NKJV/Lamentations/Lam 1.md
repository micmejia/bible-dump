# Lamentations 1

***


###### 1 
How lonely sits the city _That was_ full of people! _How_ like a widow is she, Who _was_ great among the nations! The princess among the provinces Has become a [^a]slave! 

###### 2 
She weeps bitterly in the night, Her tears _are_ on her cheeks; Among all her lovers She has none to comfort _her._ All her friends have dealt treacherously with her; They have become her enemies. 

###### 3 
Judah has gone into captivity, Under affliction and hard servitude; She dwells among the [^b]nations, She finds no rest; All her persecutors overtake her in dire straits. 

###### 4 
The roads to Zion mourn Because no one comes to the [^c]set feasts. All her gates are desolate; Her priests sigh, Her virgins are afflicted, And she _is_ in bitterness. 

###### 5 
Her adversaries have become [^d]the master, Her enemies prosper; For the Lord has afflicted her Because of the multitude of her transgressions. Her children have gone into captivity before the enemy. 

###### 6 
And from the daughter of Zion All her splendor has departed. Her princes have become like deer _That_ find no pasture, That [^e]flee without strength Before the pursuer. 

###### 7 
In the days of her affliction and roaming, Jerusalem remembers all her pleasant things That she had in the days of old. When her people fell into the hand of the enemy, With no one to help her, The adversaries saw her _And_ mocked at her [^f]downfall. 

###### 8 
Jerusalem has sinned gravely, Therefore she has become [^g]vile. All who honored her despise her Because they have seen her nakedness; Yes, she sighs and turns away. 

###### 9 
Her uncleanness _is_ in her skirts; She did not consider her destiny; Therefore her collapse was awesome; She had no comforter. "O Lord, behold my affliction, For _the_ enemy is exalted!" 

###### 10 
The adversary has spread his hand Over all her [^h]pleasant things; For she has seen the nations enter her [^i]sanctuary, Those whom You commanded Not to enter Your assembly. 

###### 11 
All her people sigh, They [^j]seek bread; They have given their [^k]valuables for food to restore life. "See, O Lord, and consider, For I am scorned." 

###### 12 
"_Is it_ nothing to you, all you who [^l]pass by? Behold and see If there is any sorrow like my sorrow, Which has been brought on me, Which the Lord has inflicted In the day of His fierce anger. 

###### 13 
"From above He has sent fire into my bones, And it overpowered them; He has spread a net for my feet And turned me back; He has made me desolate _And_ faint all the day. 

###### 14 
"The yoke of my transgressions was [^m]bound; They were woven together by His hands, _And_ thrust upon my neck. He made my strength fail; The Lord delivered me into the hands of _those whom_ I am not able to withstand. 

###### 15 
"The Lord has trampled underfoot all my mighty _men_ in my midst; He has called an assembly against me To crush my young men; The Lord trampled _as_ in a winepress The virgin daughter of Judah. 

###### 16 
"For these _things_ I weep; My eye, my eye overflows with water; Because the comforter, who should restore my life, Is far from me. My children are desolate Because the enemy prevailed." 

###### 17 
Zion [^n]spreads out her hands, _But_ no one comforts her; The Lord has commanded concerning Jacob _That_ those around him _become_ his adversaries; Jerusalem has become an unclean thing among them. 

###### 18 
"The Lord is righteous, For I rebelled against His [^o]commandment. Hear now, all peoples, And behold my sorrow; My virgins and my young men Have gone into captivity. 

###### 19 
"I called for my lovers, _But_ they deceived me; My priests and my elders Breathed their last in the city, While they sought food To restore their life. 

###### 20 
"See, O Lord, that I _am_ in distress; My soul[^p] is troubled; My heart is overturned within me, For I have been very rebellious. Outside the sword bereaves, At home _it is_ like death. 

###### 21 
"They have heard that I sigh, _But_ no one comforts me. All my enemies have heard of my trouble; They are glad that You have done _it._ Bring on the day You have [^q]announced, That they may become like me. 

###### 22 
"Let all their wickedness come before You, And do to them as You have done to me For all my transgressions; For my sighs _are_ many, And my heart _is_ faint." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

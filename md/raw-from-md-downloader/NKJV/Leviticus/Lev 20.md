# Leviticus 20

***


###### 1 
Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 

###### 2 
"Again, you shall say to the children of Israel: 'Whoever of the children of Israel, or of the strangers who [^a]dwell in Israel, who gives _any_ of his descendants to Molech, he shall surely be put to death. The people of the land shall stone him with stones. 

###### 3 
I will set My face against that man, and will [^b]cut him off from his people, because he has given _some_ of his descendants to Molech, to defile My sanctuary and profane My holy name. 

###### 4 
And if the people of the land should in any way [^c]hide their eyes from the man, when he gives _some_ of his descendants to Molech, and they do not kill him, 

###### 5 
then I will set My face against that man and against his family; and I will cut him off from his people, and all who prostitute themselves with him to commit harlotry with Molech. 

###### 6 
'And the person who turns to mediums and familiar spirits, to prostitute himself with them, I will set My face against that person and cut him off from his people. 

###### 7 
Consecrate[^d] yourselves therefore, and be holy, for I _am_ the Lord your God. 

###### 8 
And you shall keep My statutes, and perform them: I _am_ the Lord who [^e]sanctifies you. 

###### 9 
'For everyone who curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death. He has cursed his father or his mother. His blood _shall be_ upon him. 

###### 10 
'The man who commits adultery with _another_ man's wife, _he_ who commits adultery with his neighbor's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress, shall surely be put to death. 

###### 11 
The man who lies with his father's wife has uncovered his father's nakedness; both of them shall surely be put to death. Their blood _shall be_ upon them. 

###### 12 
If a man lies with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall surely be put to death. They have committed perversion. Their blood _shall be_ upon them. 

###### 13 
If a man lies with a male as he lies with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination. They shall surely be put to death. Their blood _shall be_ upon them. 

###### 14 
If a man marries a woman and her mother, it _is_ wickedness. They shall be burned with fire, both he and they, that there may be no wickedness among you. 

###### 15 
If a man mates with an animal, he shall surely be put to death, and you shall kill the animal. 

###### 16 
If a woman approaches any animal and mates with it, you shall kill the woman and the animal. They shall surely be put to death. Their blood _is_ upon them. 

###### 17 
'If a man takes his sister, his father's daughter or his mother's daughter, and sees her nakedness and she sees his nakedness, it _is_ a wicked thing. And they shall be [^f]cut off in the sight of their people. He has uncovered his sister's nakedness. He shall bear his [^g]guilt. 

###### 18 
If a man lies with a woman during her [^h]sickness and uncovers her nakedness, he has [^i]exposed her flow, and she has uncovered the flow of her blood. Both of them shall be [^j]cut off from their people. 

###### 19 
'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother's sister nor of your father's sister, for that would uncover his near of kin. They shall bear their guilt. 

###### 20 
If a man lies with his uncle's wife, he has uncovered his uncle's nakedness. They shall bear their sin; they shall die childless. 

###### 21 
If a man takes his brother's wife, it _is_ an [^k]unclean thing. He has uncovered his brother's nakedness. They shall be childless. 

###### 22 
'You shall therefore keep all My statutes and all My judgments, and perform them, that the land where I am bringing you to dwell may not vomit you out. 

###### 23 
And you shall not walk in the statutes of the nation which I am casting out before you; for they commit all these things, and therefore I abhor them. 

###### 24 
But I have said to you, "You shall inherit their land, and I will give it to you to possess, a land flowing with milk and honey." I _am_ the Lord your God, who has separated you from the peoples. 

###### 25 
You shall therefore distinguish between clean animals and unclean, between unclean birds and clean, and you shall not make yourselves [^l]abominable by beast or by bird, or by any kind of living thing that creeps on the ground, which I have separated from you as [^m]unclean. 

###### 26 
And you shall be holy to Me, for I the Lord _am_ holy, and have separated you from the peoples, that you should be Mine. 

###### 27 
'A man or a woman who is a medium, or who has familiar spirits, shall surely be put to death; they shall stone them with stones. Their blood _shall be_ upon them.'

# Mark 15

***


###### 1 
Immediately, in the morning, the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council; and they bound Jesus, led _Him_ away, and delivered _Him_ to Pilate. 

###### 2 
Then Pilate asked Him, "Are You the King of the Jews?" He answered and said to him, "_It is as_ you say." 

###### 3 
And the chief priests accused Him of many things, but He answered nothing. 

###### 4 
Then Pilate asked Him again, saying, "Do You answer nothing? See how many things [^a]they testify against You!" 

###### 5 
But Jesus still answered nothing, so that Pilate marveled. ## Taking the Place of Barabbas 

###### 6 
Now at the feast he was accustomed to releasing one prisoner to them, whomever they requested. 

###### 7 
And there was one named Barabbas, _who was_ chained with his fellow rebels; they had committed murder in the rebellion. 

###### 8 
Then the multitude, [^b]crying aloud, began to ask _him to do_ just as he had always done for them. 

###### 9 
But Pilate answered them, saying, "Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?" 

###### 10 
For he knew that the chief priests had handed Him over because of envy. 

###### 11 
But the chief priests stirred up the crowd, so that he should rather release Barabbas to them. 

###### 12 
Pilate answered and said to them again, "What then do you want me to do _with Him_ whom you call the King of the Jews?" 

###### 13 
So they cried out again, "Crucify Him!" 

###### 14 
Then Pilate said to them, "Why, what evil has He done?" But they cried out all the more, "Crucify Him!" 

###### 15 
So Pilate, wanting to gratify the crowd, released Barabbas to them; and he delivered Jesus, after he had scourged _Him,_ to be crucified. ## The Soldiers Mock Jesus 

###### 16 
Then the soldiers led Him away into the hall called [^c]Praetorium, and they called together the whole garrison. 

###### 17 
And they clothed Him with purple; and they twisted a crown of thorns, put it on His _head,_ 

###### 18 
and began to salute Him, "Hail, King of the Jews!" 

###### 19 
Then they struck Him on the head with a reed and spat on Him; and bowing the knee, they worshiped Him. 

###### 20 
And when they had mocked Him, they took the purple off Him, put His own clothes on Him, and led Him out to crucify Him. ## The King on a Cross 

###### 21 
Then they compelled a certain man, Simon a Cyrenian, the father of Alexander and Rufus, as he was coming out of the country and passing by, to bear His cross. 

###### 22 
And they brought Him to the place Golgotha, which is translated, Place of a Skull. 

###### 23 
Then they gave Him wine mingled with myrrh to drink, but He did not take _it._ 

###### 24 
And when they crucified Him, they divided His garments, casting lots for them _to determine_ what every man should take. 

###### 25 
Now it was the third hour, and they crucified Him. 

###### 26 
And the inscription of His [^d]accusation was written above: THE KING OF THE JEWS. 

###### 27 
With Him they also crucified two robbers, one on His right and the other on His left. 

###### 28 
[^e]So the Scripture was fulfilled which says, "And He was numbered with the transgressors." 

###### 29 
And those who passed by blasphemed Him, wagging their heads and saying, "Aha! _You_ who destroy the temple and build _it_ in three days, 

###### 30 
save Yourself, and come down from the cross!" 

###### 31 
Likewise the chief priests also, mocking among themselves with the scribes, said, "He saved others; Himself He cannot save. 

###### 32 
Let the Christ, the King of Israel, descend now from the cross, that we may see and [^f]believe." Even those who were crucified with Him reviled Him. ## Jesus Dies on the Cross 

###### 33 
Now when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. 

###### 34 
And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" which is translated, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" 

###### 35 
Some of those who stood by, when they heard _that,_ said, "Look, He is calling for Elijah!" 

###### 36 
Then someone ran and filled a sponge full of sour wine, put _it_ on a reed, and offered _it_ to Him to drink, saying, "Let Him alone; let us see if Elijah will come to take Him down." 

###### 37 
And Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and breathed His last. 

###### 38 
Then the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. 

###### 39 
So when the centurion, who stood opposite Him, saw that [^g]He cried out like this and breathed His last, he said, "Truly this Man was the Son of God!" 

###### 40 
There were also women looking on from afar, among whom were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the Less and of Joses, and Salome, 

###### 41 
who also followed Him and ministered to Him when He was in Galilee, and many other women who came up with Him to Jerusalem. ## Jesus Buried in Joseph's Tomb 

###### 42 
Now when evening had come, because it was the Preparation Day, that is, the day before the Sabbath, 

###### 43 
Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent council member, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, coming and taking courage, went in to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. 

###### 44 
Pilate marveled that He was already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him if He had been dead for some time. 

###### 45 
So when he found out from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph. 

###### 46 
Then he bought fine linen, took Him down, and wrapped Him in the linen. And he laid Him in a tomb which had been hewn out of the rock, and rolled a stone against the door of the tomb. 

###### 47 
And Mary Magdalene and Mary _the mother_ of Joses observed where He was laid. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

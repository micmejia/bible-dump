# Micah 3

***


###### 1 
And I said: "Hear now, O heads of Jacob, And you rulers of the house of Israel: _Is it_ not for you to know justice? 

###### 2 
You who hate good and love evil; Who strip the skin from [^a]My people, And the flesh from their bones; 

###### 3 
Who also eat the flesh of My people, Flay their skin from them, Break their bones, And chop _them_ in pieces Like _meat_ for the pot, Like flesh in the caldron." 

###### 4 
Then they will cry to the Lord, But He will not hear them; He will even hide His face from them at that time, Because they have been evil in their deeds. 

###### 5 
Thus says the Lord concerning the prophets Who make my people stray; Who chant [^b]"Peace" [^c]While they chew with their teeth, But who prepare war against him Who puts nothing into their mouths: 

###### 6 
"Therefore you shall have night without [^d]vision, And you shall have darkness without divination; The sun shall go down on the prophets, And the day shall be dark for them. 

###### 7 
So the seers shall be ashamed, And the diviners abashed; Indeed they shall all cover their lips; For _there is_ no answer from God." 

###### 8 
But truly I am full of power by the Spirit of the Lord, And of justice and might, To declare to Jacob his transgression And to Israel his sin. 

###### 9 
Now hear this, You heads of the house of Jacob And rulers of the house of Israel, Who abhor justice And [^e]pervert all equity, 

###### 10 
Who build up Zion with bloodshed And Jerusalem with iniquity: 

###### 11 
Her heads judge for a bribe, Her priests teach for pay, And her prophets divine for [^f]money. Yet they lean on the Lord, and say, "Is not the Lord among us? No harm can come upon us." 

###### 12 
Therefore because of you Zion shall be plowed _like_ a field, Jerusalem shall become heaps of ruins, And the mountain of the [^g]temple Like the bare hills of the forest. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

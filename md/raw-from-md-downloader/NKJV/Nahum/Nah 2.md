# Nahum 2

***


###### 1 
He[^a] who scatters has come up before your face. Man the fort! Watch the road! Strengthen _your_ flanks! Fortify _your_ power mightily. 

###### 2 
For the Lord will restore the excellence of Jacob Like the excellence of Israel, For the emptiers have emptied them out And ruined their vine branches. 

###### 3 
The shields of his mighty men _are_ made red, The valiant men _are_ in scarlet. The chariots _come_ with flaming torches In the day of his preparation, And [^b]the spears are brandished. 

###### 4 
The chariots rage in the streets, They jostle one another in the broad roads; They seem like torches, They run like lightning. 

###### 5 
He remembers his nobles; They stumble in their walk; They make haste to her walls, And the defense is prepared. 

###### 6 
The gates of the rivers are opened, And the palace is dissolved. 

###### 7 
[^c]It is decreed: She shall be led away captive, She shall be brought up; And her maidservants shall lead _her_ as with the voice of doves, Beating their breasts. 

###### 8 
Though Nineveh of old _was_ like a pool of water, Now they flee away. [^d]"Halt! Halt!" _they cry;_ But no one turns back. 

###### 9 
[^e]Take spoil of silver! Take spoil of gold! _There is_ no end of treasure, Or wealth of every desirable prize. 

###### 10 
She is empty, desolate, and waste! The heart melts, and the knees shake; Much pain _is_ in every side, And all their faces [^f]are drained of color. 

###### 11 
Where _is_ the dwelling of the lions, And the feeding place of the young lions, Where the lion walked, the lioness _and_ lion's cub, And no one made _them_ afraid? 

###### 12 
The lion tore in pieces enough for his cubs, [^g]Killed for his lionesses, Filled his caves with prey, And his dens with [^h]flesh. 

###### 13 
"Behold, I _am_ against you," says the Lord of hosts, "I will burn [^i]your chariots in smoke, and the sword shall devour your young lions; I will cut off your prey from the earth, and the voice of your messengers shall be heard no more." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

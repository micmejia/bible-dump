###### 28 
Now the rest of the people--the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, the Nethinim, and all those who had separated themselves from the peoples of the lands to the Law of God, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, everyone who had knowledge and understanding-- 

###### 29 
these joined with their brethren, their nobles, and entered into a curse and an oath to walk in God's Law, which was given by Moses the servant of God, and to observe and do all the commandments of the Lord our Lord, and His ordinances and His statutes: 

###### 30 
We would not give our daughters as wives to the peoples of the land, nor take their daughters for our sons; 

###### 31 
_if_ the peoples of the land brought [^b]wares or any grain to sell on the Sabbath day, we would not buy it from them on the Sabbath, or on a holy day; and we would forego the seventh year's _produce_ and the exacting[^c] of every debt. 

###### 32 
Also we made ordinances for ourselves, to exact from ourselves yearly one-third of a shekel for the service of the house of our God: 

###### 33 
for the showbread, for the regular grain offering, for the regular burnt offering of the Sabbaths, the New Moons, and the set feasts; for the holy things, for the sin offerings to make atonement for Israel, and all the work of the house of our God. 

###### 34 
We cast lots among the priests, the Levites, and the people, for bringing the wood offering into the house of our God, according to our fathers' houses, at the appointed times year by year, to burn on the altar of the Lord our God as _it is_ written in the Law. 

###### 35 
And _we made ordinances_ to bring the firstfruits of our ground and the firstfruits of all fruit of all trees, year by year, to the house of the Lord; 

###### 36 
to bring the firstborn of our sons and our cattle, as _it is_ written in the Law, and the firstborn of our herds and our flocks, to the house of our God, to the priests who minister in the house of our God; 

###### 37 
to bring the firstfruits of our dough, our offerings, the fruit from all kinds of trees, _the_ new wine and oil, to the priests, to the storerooms of the [^d]house of our God; and to bring the tithes of our land to the Levites, for the Levites should receive the tithes in all our farming communities. 

###### 38 
And the priest, the descendant of Aaron, shall be with the Levites when the Levites receive tithes; and the Levites shall bring up a tenth of the tithes to the house of our God, to the rooms of the storehouse. 

###### 39 
For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring the offering of the grain, of the new wine and the oil, to the storerooms where the articles of the sanctuary _are, where_ the priests who minister and the gatekeepers and the singers _are;_ and we will not neglect the house of our God. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

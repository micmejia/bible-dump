# Numbers 12

***


###### 1 
Then Miriam and Aaron [^a]spoke against Moses because of the [^b]Ethiopian woman whom he had married; for he had married an Ethiopian woman. 

###### 2 
So they said, "Has the Lord indeed spoken only through Moses? Has He not spoken through us also?" And the Lord heard _it._ 

###### 3 
(Now the man Moses _was_ very humble, more than all men who _were_ on the face of the earth.) 

###### 4 
Suddenly the Lord said to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, "Come out, you three, to the tabernacle of meeting!" So the three came out. 

###### 5 
Then the Lord came down in the pillar of cloud and stood _in_ the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam. And they both went forward. 

###### 6 
Then He said, "Hear now My words: If there is a prophet among you, _I_, the Lord, make Myself known to him in a vision; I speak to him in a dream. 

###### 7 
Not so with My servant Moses; He _is_ faithful in all My house. 

###### 8 
I speak with him face to face, Even plainly,[^c] and not in [^d]dark sayings; And he sees the form of the Lord. Why then were you not afraid To speak against My servant Moses?" 

###### 9 
So the anger of the Lord was aroused against them, and He departed. 

###### 10 
And when the cloud departed from above the tabernacle, suddenly Miriam _became_ leprous, as _white as_ snow. Then Aaron turned toward Miriam, and there she was, a leper. 

###### 11 
So Aaron said to Moses, "Oh, my lord! Please do not lay [^e]_this_ sin on us, in which we have done foolishly and in which we have sinned. 

###### 12 
Please do not let her be as one dead, whose flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother's womb!" 

###### 13 
So Moses cried out to the Lord, saying, "Please heal her, O God, I pray!" 

###### 14 
Then the Lord said to Moses, "If her father had but spit in her face, would she not be shamed seven days? Let her be shut[^f] out of the camp seven days, and afterward she may be received _again._" 

###### 15 
So Miriam was shut out of the camp seven days, and the people did not journey till Miriam was brought in _again._ 

###### 16 
And afterward the people moved from Hazeroth and camped in the Wilderness of Paran. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Obadiah 1

***


###### 1 
The vision of Obadiah. Thus says the Lord God concerning Edom (We have heard a report from the Lord, And a messenger has been sent among the nations, _saying,_ "Arise, and let us rise up against her for battle"): 

###### 2 
"Behold, I will make you small among the nations; You shall be greatly despised. 

###### 3 
The pride of your heart has deceived you, _You_ who dwell in the clefts of the rock, Whose habitation is high; _You_ who say in your heart, 'Who will bring me down to the ground?' 

###### 4 
Though you ascend _as_ high as the eagle, And though you set your nest among the stars, From there I will bring you down," says the Lord. 

###### 5 
"If thieves had come to you, If robbers by night-- Oh, how you will be cut off!-- Would they not have stolen till they had enough? If grape-gatherers had come to you, Would they not have left _some_ gleanings? 

###### 6 
"Oh, how Esau shall be searched out! _How_ his hidden treasures shall be sought after! 

###### 7 
All the men in your confederacy Shall force you to the border; The men at peace with you Shall deceive you _and_ prevail against you. _Those who eat_ your bread shall lay a [^a]trap for you. No[^b] one is aware of it. 

###### 8 
"Will I not in that day," says the Lord, "Even destroy the wise _men_ from Edom, And understanding from the mountains of Esau? 

###### 9 
Then your mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed, To the end that everyone from the mountains of Esau May be cut off by slaughter. ## Edom Mistreated His Brother 

###### 10 
"For violence against your brother Jacob, Shame shall cover you, And you shall be cut off forever. 

###### 11 
In the day that you stood on the other side-- In the day that strangers carried captive his forces, When foreigners entered his gates And cast lots for Jerusalem-- Even you _were_ as one of them. 

###### 12 
"But you should not have gazed[^c] on the day of your brother [^d]In the day of his captivity; Nor should you have rejoiced over the children of Judah In the day of their destruction; Nor should you have spoken proudly In the day of distress. 

###### 13 
You should not have entered the gate of My people In the day of their calamity. Indeed, you should not have [^e]gazed on their affliction In the day of their calamity, Nor laid _hands_ on their substance In the day of their calamity. 

###### 14 
You should not have stood at the crossroads To cut off those among them who escaped; Nor should you have [^f]delivered up those among them who remained In the day of distress. 

###### 15 
"For the day of the Lord upon all the nations _is_ near; As you have done, it shall be done to you; Your [^g]reprisal shall return upon your own head. 

###### 16 
For as you drank on My holy mountain, _So_ shall all the nations drink continually; Yes, they shall drink, and swallow, And they shall be as though they had never been. ## Israel's Final Triumph 

###### 17 
"But on Mount Zion there shall be [^h]deliverance, And there shall be holiness; The house of Jacob shall possess their possessions. 

###### 18 
The house of Jacob shall be a fire, And the house of Joseph a flame; But the house of Esau _shall be_ stubble; They shall kindle them and devour them, And no survivor shall _remain_ of the house of Esau," For the Lord has spoken. 

###### 19 
The [^i]South shall possess the mountains of Esau, And the Lowland shall possess Philistia. They shall possess the fields of Ephraim And the fields of Samaria. Benjamin _shall possess_ Gilead. 

###### 20 
And the captives of this host of the children of Israel _Shall possess the land_ of the Canaanites As far as Zarephath. The captives of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad Shall possess the cities of the [^j]South. 

###### 21 
Then saviors[^k] shall come to Mount Zion To judge the mountains of Esau, And the kingdom shall be the Lord's. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Philemon 1

***


###### 1 
Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy _our_ brother, To Philemon our beloved _friend_ and fellow laborer, 

###### 2 
to [^a]the beloved Apphia, Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house: 

###### 3 
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. ## Philemon's Love and Faith 

###### 4 
I thank my God, making mention of you always in my prayers, 

###### 5 
hearing of your love and faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints, 

###### 6 
that the sharing of your faith may become effective by the acknowledgment of every good thing which is in [^b]you in Christ Jesus. 

###### 7 
For we [^c]have great [^d]joy and [^e]consolation in your love, because the [^f]hearts of the saints have been refreshed by you, brother. ## The Plea for Onesimus 

###### 8 
Therefore, though I might be very bold in Christ to command you what is fitting, 

###### 9 
_yet_ for love's sake I rather appeal _to you_--being such a one as Paul, the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ-- 

###### 10 
I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten _while_ in my chains, 

###### 11 
who once was unprofitable to you, but now is profitable to you and to me. 

###### 12 
I am sending him [^g]back. You therefore receive him, that is, my own [^h]heart, 

###### 13 
whom I wished to keep with me, that on your behalf he might minister to me in my chains for the gospel. 

###### 14 
But without your consent I wanted to do nothing, that your good deed might not be by compulsion, as it were, but voluntary. 

###### 15 
For perhaps he departed for a while for this _purpose,_ that you might receive him forever, 

###### 16 
no longer as a slave but more than a slave--a beloved brother, especially to me but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord. ## Philemon's Obedience Encouraged 

###### 17 
If then you count me as a partner, receive him as _you would_ me. 

###### 18 
But if he has wronged you or owes anything, put that on my account. 

###### 19 
I, Paul, am writing with my own hand. I will repay--not to mention to you that you owe me even your own self besides. 

###### 20 
Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in the Lord. 

###### 21 
Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say. 

###### 22 
But, meanwhile, also prepare a guest room for me, for I trust that through your prayers I shall be granted to you. ## Farewell 

###### 23 
Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you, 

###### 24 
_as do_ Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow laborers. 

###### 25 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ _be_ with your spirit. Amen. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

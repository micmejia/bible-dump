# Proverbs 1

***


###### 1 
The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel: 

###### 2 
To know wisdom and instruction, To [^a]perceive the words of understanding, 

###### 3 
To receive the instruction of wisdom, Justice, judgment, and equity; 

###### 4 
To give prudence to the simple, To the young man knowledge and discretion-- 

###### 5 
A wise _man_ will hear and increase learning, And a man of understanding will [^b]attain wise counsel, 

###### 6 
To understand a proverb and an enigma, The words of the wise and their riddles. 

###### 7 
The fear of the Lord _is_ the beginning of knowledge, _But_ fools despise wisdom and instruction. ## Shun Evil Counsel 

###### 8 
My son, hear the instruction of your father, And do not forsake the law of your mother; 

###### 9 
For they _will be_ a graceful ornament on your head, And chains about your neck. 

###### 10 
My son, if sinners entice you, Do not consent. 

###### 11 
If they say, "Come with us, Let us lie in wait to _shed_ blood; Let us lurk secretly for the innocent without cause; 

###### 12 
Let us swallow them alive like [^c]Sheol, And whole, like those who go down to the Pit; 

###### 13 
We shall find all _kinds_ of precious [^d]possessions, We shall fill our houses with [^e]spoil; 

###### 14 
Cast in your lot among us, Let us all have one purse"-- 

###### 15 
My son, do not walk in the way with them, Keep your foot from their path; 

###### 16 
For their feet run to evil, And they make haste to shed blood. 

###### 17 
Surely, in [^f]vain the net is spread In the sight of any [^g]bird; 

###### 18 
But they lie in wait for their _own_ blood, They lurk secretly for their _own_ lives. 

###### 19 
So _are_ the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain; It takes away the life of its owners. ## The Call of Wisdom 

###### 20 
Wisdom calls aloud [^h]outside; She raises her voice in the open squares. 

###### 21 
She cries out in the [^i]chief concourses, At the openings of the gates in the city She speaks her words: 

###### 22 
"How long, you [^j]simple ones, will you love [^k]simplicity? For scorners delight in their scorning, And fools hate knowledge. 

###### 23 
Turn at my rebuke; Surely I will pour out my spirit on you; I will make my words known to you. 

###### 24 
Because I have called and you refused, I have stretched out my hand and no one regarded, 

###### 25 
Because you disdained all my counsel, And would have none of my rebuke, 

###### 26 
I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your terror comes, 

###### 27 
When your terror comes like a storm, And your destruction comes like a whirlwind, When distress and anguish come upon you. 

###### 28 
"Then they will call on me, but I will not answer; They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me. 

###### 29 
Because they hated knowledge And did not choose the fear of the Lord, 

###### 30 
They would have none of my counsel _And_ despised my every rebuke. 

###### 31 
Therefore they shall eat the fruit of their own way, And be filled to the full with their own fancies. 

###### 32 
For the [^l]turning away of the simple will slay them, And the complacency of fools will destroy them; 

###### 33 
But whoever listens to me will dwell safely, And will be [^m]secure, without fear of evil." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

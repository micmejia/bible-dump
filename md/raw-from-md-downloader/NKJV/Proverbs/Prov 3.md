# Proverbs 3

***


###### 1 
My son, do not forget my law, But let your heart keep my commands; 

###### 2 
For length of days and long life And peace they will add to you. 

###### 3 
Let not mercy and truth forsake you; Bind them around your neck, Write them on the tablet of your heart, 

###### 4 
_And_ so find favor and [^a]high esteem In the sight of God and man. 

###### 5 
Trust in the Lord with all your heart, And lean not on your own understanding; 

###### 6 
In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He shall [^b]direct your paths. 

###### 7 
Do not be wise in your own eyes; Fear the Lord and depart from evil. 

###### 8 
It will be health to your [^c]flesh, And strength[^d] to your bones. 

###### 9 
Honor the Lord with your possessions, And with the firstfruits of all your increase; 

###### 10 
So your barns will be filled with plenty, And your vats will overflow with new wine. 

###### 11 
My son, do not despise the chastening of the Lord, Nor detest His correction; 

###### 12 
For whom the Lord loves He corrects, Just as a father the son _in whom_ he delights. 

###### 13 
Happy _is_ the man _who_ finds wisdom, And the man _who_ gains understanding; 

###### 14 
For her proceeds _are_ better than the profits of silver, And her gain than fine gold. 

###### 15 
She _is_ more precious than rubies, And all the things you may desire cannot compare with her. 

###### 16 
Length of days _is_ in her right hand, In her left hand riches and honor. 

###### 17 
Her ways _are_ ways of pleasantness, And all her paths _are_ peace. 

###### 18 
She _is_ a tree of life to those who take hold of her, And happy _are all_ who [^e]retain her. 

###### 19 
The Lord by wisdom founded the earth; By understanding He established the heavens; 

###### 20 
By His knowledge the depths were broken up, And clouds drop down the dew. 

###### 21 
My son, let them not depart from your eyes-- Keep sound wisdom and discretion; 

###### 22 
So they will be life to your soul And grace to your neck. 

###### 23 
Then you will walk safely in your way, And your foot will not stumble. 

###### 24 
When you lie down, you will not be afraid; Yes, you will lie down and your sleep will be sweet. 

###### 25 
Do not be afraid of sudden terror, Nor of trouble from the wicked when it comes; 

###### 26 
For the Lord will be your confidence, And will keep your foot from being caught. 

###### 27 
Do not withhold good from [^f]those to whom it is due, When it is in the power of your hand to do _so._ 

###### 28 
Do not say to your neighbor, "Go, and come back, And tomorrow I will give _it,_" When you have it with you. 

###### 29 
Do not devise evil against your neighbor, For he dwells by you for safety's sake. 

###### 30 
Do not strive with a man without cause, If he has done you no harm. 

###### 31 
Do not envy the oppressor, And choose none of his ways; 

###### 32 
For the perverse _person is_ an abomination to the Lord, But His secret counsel _is_ with the upright. 

###### 33 
The curse of the Lord _is_ on the house of the wicked, But He blesses the home of the just. 

###### 34 
Surely He scorns the scornful, But gives grace to the humble. 

###### 35 
The wise shall inherit glory, But shame shall be the legacy of fools. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

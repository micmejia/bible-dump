# Proverbs 30

***


###### 1 
The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, _his_ utterance. This man declared to Ithiel--to Ithiel and Ucal: 

###### 2 
Surely I _am_ more stupid than _any_ man, And do not have the understanding of a man. 

###### 3 
I neither learned wisdom Nor have knowledge of the Holy One. 

###### 4 
Who has ascended into heaven, or descended? Who has gathered the wind in His fists? Who has bound the waters in a garment? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What _is_ His name, and what _is_ His Son's name, If you know? 

###### 5 
Every word of God _is_ [^a]pure; He _is_ a shield to those who put their trust in Him. 

###### 6 
Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar. 

###### 7 
Two _things_ I request of You (Deprive me not before I die): 

###### 8 
Remove falsehood and lies far from me; Give me neither poverty nor riches-- Feed me with the food allotted to me; 

###### 9 
Lest I be full and deny _You,_ And say, "Who _is_ the Lord?" Or lest I be poor and steal, And profane the name of my God. 

###### 10 
Do not malign a servant to his master, Lest he curse you, and you be found guilty. 

###### 11 
_There is_ a generation _that_ curses its father, And does not bless its mother. 

###### 12 
_There is_ a generation _that is_ pure in its own eyes, _Yet_ is not washed from its filthiness. 

###### 13 
_There is_ a generation--oh, how lofty are their eyes! And their eyelids are [^b]lifted up. 

###### 14 
_There is_ a generation whose teeth _are like_ swords, And whose fangs _are like_ knives, To devour the poor from off the earth, And the needy from _among_ men. 

###### 15 
The leech has two daughters-- Give _and_ Give! There are three _things that_ are never satisfied, Four never say, "Enough!": 

###### 16 
The[^c] grave, The barren womb, The earth _that_ is not satisfied with water-- And the fire never says, "Enough!" 

###### 17 
The eye _that_ mocks _his_ father, And scorns obedience to _his_ mother, The ravens of the valley will pick it out, And the young eagles will eat it. 

###### 18 
There are three _things which_ are too wonderful for me, Yes, four _which_ I do not understand: 

###### 19 
The way of an eagle in the air, The way of a serpent on a rock, The way of a ship in the [^d]midst of the sea, And the way of a man with a virgin. 

###### 20 
This _is_ the way of an adulterous woman: She eats and wipes her mouth, And says, "I have done no wickedness." 

###### 21 
For three _things_ the earth is perturbed, Yes, for four it cannot bear up: 

###### 22 
For a servant when he reigns, A fool when he is filled with food, 

###### 23 
A [^e]hateful _woman_ when she is married, And a maidservant who succeeds her mistress. 

###### 24 
There are four _things which_ are little on the earth, But they _are_ exceedingly wise: 

###### 25 
The ants _are_ a people not strong, Yet they prepare their food in the summer; 

###### 26 
The [^f]rock badgers are a feeble folk, Yet they make their homes in the crags; 

###### 27 
The locusts have no king, Yet they all advance in ranks; 

###### 28 
The [^g]spider skillfully grasps with its hands, And it is in kings' palaces. 

###### 29 
There are three _things which_ are majestic in pace, Yes, four _which_ are stately in walk: 

###### 30 
A lion, _which is_ mighty among beasts And does not turn away from any; 

###### 31 
A [^h]greyhound, A male goat also, And [^i]a king _whose_ troops _are_ with him. 

###### 32 
If you have been foolish in exalting yourself, Or if you have devised evil, _put your_ hand on _your_ mouth. 

###### 33 
For _as_ the churning of milk produces butter, And wringing the nose produces blood, So the forcing of wrath produces strife. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Proverbs 4

***


###### 1 
Hear, _my_ children, the instruction of a father, And give attention to know understanding; 

###### 2 
For I give you good doctrine: Do not forsake my law. 

###### 3 
When I was my father's son, Tender and the only one in the sight of my mother, 

###### 4 
He also taught me, and said to me: "Let your heart retain my words; Keep my commands, and live. 

###### 5 
Get wisdom! Get understanding! Do not forget, nor turn away from the words of my mouth. 

###### 6 
Do not forsake her, and she will preserve you; Love her, and she will keep you. 

###### 7 
Wisdom _is_ the principal thing; _Therefore_ get wisdom. And in all your getting, get understanding. 

###### 8 
Exalt her, and she will promote you; She will bring you honor, when you embrace her. 

###### 9 
She will place on your head an ornament of grace; A crown of glory she will deliver to you." 

###### 10 
Hear, my son, and receive my sayings, And the years of your life will be many. 

###### 11 
I have taught you in the way of wisdom; I have led you in right paths. 

###### 12 
When you walk, your steps will not be hindered, And when you run, you will not stumble. 

###### 13 
Take firm hold of instruction, do not let go; Keep her, for she _is_ your life. 

###### 14 
Do not enter the path of the wicked, And do not walk in the way of evil. 

###### 15 
Avoid it, do not travel on it; Turn away from it and pass on. 

###### 16 
For they do not sleep unless they have done evil; And their sleep is [^a]taken away unless they make _someone_ fall. 

###### 17 
For they eat the bread of wickedness, And drink the wine of violence. 

###### 18 
But the path of the just _is_ like the shining [^b]sun, That shines ever brighter unto the perfect day. 

###### 19 
The way of the wicked _is_ like darkness; They do not know what makes them stumble. 

###### 20 
My son, give attention to my words; Incline your ear to my sayings. 

###### 21 
Do not let them depart from your eyes; Keep them in the midst of your heart; 

###### 22 
For they _are_ life to those who find them, And health to all their flesh. 

###### 23 
Keep your heart with all diligence, For out of it _spring_ the issues of life. 

###### 24 
Put away from you a [^c]deceitful mouth, And put perverse lips far from you. 

###### 25 
Let your eyes look straight ahead, And your eyelids look right before you. 

###### 26 
Ponder the path of your feet, And let all your ways be established. 

###### 27 
Do not turn to the right or the left; Remove your foot from evil. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Proverbs 7

***


###### 1 
My son, keep my words, And treasure my commands within you. 

###### 2 
Keep my commands and live, And my law as the apple of your eye. 

###### 3 
Bind them on your fingers; Write them on the tablet of your heart. 

###### 4 
Say to wisdom, "You _are_ my sister," And call understanding _your_ nearest kin, 

###### 5 
That they may keep you from the immoral woman, From the seductress _who_ flatters with her words. ## The Crafty Harlot 

###### 6 
For at the window of my house I looked through my lattice, 

###### 7 
And saw among the simple, I perceived among the [^a]youths, A young man devoid[^b] of understanding, 

###### 8 
Passing along the street near her corner; And he took the path to her house 

###### 9 
In the twilight, in the evening, In the black and dark night. 

###### 10 
And there a woman met him, _With_ the attire of a harlot, and a crafty heart. 

###### 11 
She _was_ loud and rebellious, Her feet would not stay at home. 

###### 12 
At times _she was_ outside, at times in the open square, Lurking at every corner. 

###### 13 
So she caught him and kissed him; With an [^c]impudent face she said to him: 

###### 14 
"_I have_ peace offerings with me; Today I have paid my vows. 

###### 15 
So I came out to meet you, Diligently to seek your face, And I have found you. 

###### 16 
I have spread my bed with tapestry, Colored coverings of Egyptian linen. 

###### 17 
I have perfumed my bed With myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 

###### 18 
Come, let us take our fill of love until morning; Let us delight ourselves with love. 

###### 19 
For [^d]my husband _is_ not at home; He has gone on a long journey; 

###### 20 
He has taken a bag of money [^e]with him, _And_ will come home [^f]on the appointed day." 

###### 21 
[^g]With her enticing speech she caused him to yield, With her flattering lips she [^h]seduced him. 

###### 22 
Immediately he went after her, as an ox goes to the slaughter, Or [^i]as a fool to the correction of the [^j]stocks, 

###### 23 
Till an arrow struck his liver. As a bird hastens to the snare, He did not know it [^k]_would cost_ his life. 

###### 24 
Now therefore, listen to me, _my_ children; Pay attention to the words of my mouth: 

###### 25 
Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways, Do not stray into her paths; 

###### 26 
For she has cast down many wounded, And all who were slain by her were strong _men._ 

###### 27 
Her house _is_ the way to [^l]hell, Descending to the chambers of death. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Psalms 114

***


###### 1 
When Israel went out of Egypt, The house of Jacob from a people [^a]of strange language, 

###### 2 
Judah became His sanctuary, _And_ Israel His dominion. 

###### 3 
The sea saw _it_ and fled; Jordan turned back. 

###### 4 
The mountains skipped like rams, The little hills like lambs. 

###### 5 
What ails you, O sea, that you fled? O Jordan, _that_ you turned back? 

###### 6 
O mountains, _that_ you skipped like rams? O little hills, like lambs? 

###### 7 
Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord, At the presence of the God of Jacob, 

###### 8 
Who turned the rock _into_ a pool of water, The flint into a fountain of waters. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Psalms 122

***


###### 1 
I was glad when they said to me, "Let us go into the house of the Lord." 

###### 2 
Our feet have been standing Within your gates, O Jerusalem! 

###### 3 
Jerusalem is built As a city that is compact together, 

###### 4 
Where the tribes go up, The tribes of the Lord, [^a]To the Testimony of Israel, To give thanks to the name of the Lord. 

###### 5 
For thrones are set there for judgment, The thrones of the house of David. 

###### 6 
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: "May they prosper who love you. 

###### 7 
Peace be within your walls, Prosperity within your palaces." 

###### 8 
For the sake of my brethren and companions, I will now say, "Peace _be_ within you." 

###### 9 
Because of the house of the Lord our God I will seek your good. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

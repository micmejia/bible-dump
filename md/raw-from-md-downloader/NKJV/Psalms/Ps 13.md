# Psalms 13

***


###### 1 
How long, O Lord? Will You forget me forever? How long will You hide Your face from me? 

###### 2 
How long shall I take counsel in my soul, _Having_ sorrow in my heart daily? How long will my enemy be exalted over me? 

###### 3 
Consider _and_ hear me, O Lord my God; Enlighten my eyes, Lest I sleep the _sleep of_ death; 

###### 4 
Lest my enemy say, "I have prevailed against him"; _Lest_ those who trouble me rejoice when I am moved. 

###### 5 
But I have trusted in Your mercy; My heart shall rejoice in Your salvation. 

###### 6 
I will sing to the Lord, Because He has dealt bountifully with me. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

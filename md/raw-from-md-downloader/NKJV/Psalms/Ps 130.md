# Psalms 130

***


###### 1 
Out of the depths I have cried to You, O Lord; 

###### 2 
Lord, hear my voice! Let Your ears be attentive To the voice of my supplications. 

###### 3 
If You, Lord, should [^a]mark iniquities, O Lord, who could stand? 

###### 4 
But _there is_ forgiveness with You, That You may be feared. 

###### 5 
I wait for the Lord, my soul waits, And in His word I do hope. 

###### 6 
My soul _waits_ for the Lord More than those who watch for the morning-- _Yes, more than_ those who watch for the morning. 

###### 7 
O Israel, hope in the Lord; For with the Lord _there is_ mercy, And with Him _is_ abundant redemption. 

###### 8 
And He shall redeem Israel From all his iniquities. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

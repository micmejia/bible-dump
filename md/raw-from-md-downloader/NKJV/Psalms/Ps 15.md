# Psalms 15

***


###### 1 
Lord, who may [^a]abide in Your tabernacle? Who may dwell in Your holy hill? 

###### 2 
He who walks uprightly, And works righteousness, And speaks the truth in his heart; 

###### 3 
He _who_ does not backbite with his tongue, Nor does evil to his neighbor, Nor does he [^b]take up a reproach against his friend; 

###### 4 
In whose eyes a vile person is despised, But he honors those who fear the Lord; He _who_ swears to his own hurt and does not change; 

###### 5 
He _who_ does not put out his money at usury, Nor does he take a bribe against the innocent. He who does these _things_ shall never be moved. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Psalms 47

***


###### 1 
Oh, clap your hands, all you peoples! Shout to God with the voice of triumph! 

###### 2 
For the Lord Most High _is_ awesome; _He is_ a great King over all the earth. 

###### 3 
He will subdue the peoples under us, And the nations under our feet. 

###### 4 
He will choose our inheritance for us, The excellence of Jacob whom He loves. <i class="selah">Selah_ 

###### 5 
God has gone up with a shout, The Lord with the sound of a trumpet. 

###### 6 
Sing praises to God, sing praises! Sing praises to our King, sing praises! 

###### 7 
For God _is_ the King of all the earth; Sing praises with understanding. 

###### 8 
God reigns over the nations; God sits on His holy throne. 

###### 9 
The princes of the people have gathered together, The people of the God of Abraham. For the shields of the earth _belong_ to God; He is greatly exalted. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

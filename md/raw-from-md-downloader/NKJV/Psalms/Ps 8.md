# Psalms 8

***


###### 1 
O Lord, our Lord, How excellent _is_ Your name in all the earth, Who have set Your glory above the heavens! 

###### 2 
Out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants You have [^b]ordained strength, Because of Your enemies, That You may silence the enemy and the avenger. 

###### 3 
When I consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, The moon and the stars, which You have ordained, 

###### 4 
What is man that You are mindful of him, And the son of man that You visit[^c] him? 

###### 5 
For You have made him a little lower than [^d]the angels, And You have crowned him with glory and honor. 

###### 6 
You have made him to have dominion over the works of Your hands; You have put all _things_ under his feet, 

###### 7 
All sheep and oxen-- Even the beasts of the field, 

###### 8 
The birds of the air, And the fish of the sea That pass through the paths of the seas. 

###### 9

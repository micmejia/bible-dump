# Revelation 14

***


###### 1 
Then I looked, and behold, [^a]a Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with Him one hundred _and_ forty-four thousand, [^b]having His Father's name written on their foreheads. 

###### 2 
And I heard a voice from heaven, like the voice of many waters, and like the voice of loud thunder. And I heard the sound of harpists playing their harps. 

###### 3 
They sang as it were a new song before the throne, before the four living creatures, and the elders; and no one could learn that song except the hundred _and_ forty-four thousand who were redeemed from the earth. 

###### 4 
These are the ones who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins. These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These were [^c]redeemed from _among_ men, _being_ firstfruits to God and to the Lamb. 

###### 5 
And in their mouth was found no [^d]deceit, for they are without fault [^e]before the throne of God. ## The Proclamations of Three Angels 

###### 6 
Then I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth--to every nation, tribe, tongue, and people-- 

###### 7 
saying with a loud voice, "Fear God and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment has come; and worship Him who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water." 

###### 8 
And another angel followed, saying, "Babylon[^f] is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she has made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication." 

###### 9 
Then a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, "If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives _his_ mark on his forehead or on his hand, 

###### 10 
he himself shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His indignation. He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. 

###### 11 
And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; and they have no rest day or night, who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name." 

###### 12 
Here is the [^g]patience of the saints; here[^h] _are_ those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. 

###### 13 
Then I heard a voice from heaven saying [^i]to me, "Write: 'Blessed _are_ the dead who die in the Lord from now on.' " "Yes," says the Spirit, "that they may rest from their labors, and their works follow them." ## Reaping the Earth's Harvest 

###### 14 
Then I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and on the cloud sat _One_ like the Son of Man, having on His head a golden crown, and in His hand a sharp sickle. 

###### 15 
And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to Him who sat on the cloud, "Thrust in Your sickle and reap, for the time has come [^j]for You to reap, for the harvest of the earth is ripe." 

###### 16 
So He who sat on the cloud thrust in His sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped. ## Reaping the Grapes of Wrath 

###### 17 
Then another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle. 

###### 18 
And another angel came out from the altar, who had power over fire, and he cried with a loud cry to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, "Thrust in your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for her grapes are fully ripe." 

###### 19 
So the angel thrust his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth, and threw _it_ into the great winepress of the wrath of God. 

###### 20 
And the winepress was trampled outside the city, and blood came out of the winepress, up to the horses' bridles, for one thousand six hundred [^k]furlongs. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

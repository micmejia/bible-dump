# Revelation 6

***


###### 1 
Now I saw when the Lamb opened one of the [^a]seals; and I heard one of the four living creatures saying with a voice like thunder, "Come and see." 

###### 2 
And I looked, and behold, a white horse. He who sat on it had a bow; and a crown was given to him, and he went out conquering and to conquer. ## Second Seal: Conflict on Earth 

###### 3 
When He opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, "Come [^b]and see." 

###### 4 
Another horse, fiery red, went out. And it was granted to the one who sat on it to take peace from the earth, and that _people_ should kill one another; and there was given to him a great sword. ## Third Seal: Scarcity on Earth 

###### 5 
When He opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, "Come and see." So I looked, and behold, a black horse, and he who sat on it had a pair of scales[^c] in his hand. 

###### 6 
And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, "A [^d]quart of wheat for a [^e]denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius; and do not harm the oil and the wine." ## Fourth Seal: Widespread Death on Earth 

###### 7 
When He opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, "Come and see." 

###### 8 
So I looked, and behold, a pale horse. And the name of him who sat on it was Death, and Hades followed with him. And [^f]power was given to them over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword, with hunger, with death, and by the beasts of the earth. ## Fifth Seal: The Cry of the Martyrs 

###### 9 
When He opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held. 

###### 10 
And they cried with a loud voice, saying, "How long, O Lord, holy and true, until You judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?" 

###### 11 
Then a white robe was given to each of them; and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, until both _the number of_ their fellow servants and their brethren, who would be killed as they _were,_ was completed. ## Sixth Seal: Cosmic Disturbances 

###### 12 
I looked when He opened the sixth seal, and [^g]behold, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the [^h]moon became like blood. 

###### 13 
And the stars of heaven fell to the earth, as a fig tree drops its late figs when it is shaken by a mighty wind. 

###### 14 
Then the sky [^i]receded as a scroll when it is rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved out of its place. 

###### 15 
And the kings of the earth, the great men, [^j]the rich men, the commanders, the mighty men, every slave and every free man, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains, 

###### 16 
and said to the mountains and rocks, "Fall on us and hide us from the face of Him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb! 

###### 17 
For the great day of His wrath has come, and who is able to stand?" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

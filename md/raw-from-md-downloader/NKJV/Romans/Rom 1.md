# Romans 1

***


###### 1 
Paul, a bondservant of Jesus Christ, called _to be_ an apostle, separated to the gospel of God 

###### 2 
which He promised before through His prophets in the Holy Scriptures, 

###### 3 
concerning His Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who [^a]was born of the seed of David according to the flesh, 

###### 4 
_and_ declared _to be_ the Son of God with power according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead. 

###### 5 
Through Him we have received grace and apostleship for obedience to the faith among all nations for His name, 

###### 6 
among whom you also are the called of Jesus Christ; 

###### 7 
To all who are in Rome, beloved of God, called _to be_ saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. ## Desire to Visit Rome 

###### 8 
First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world. 

###### 9 
For God is my witness, whom I serve [^b]with my spirit in the gospel of His Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers, 

###### 10 
making request if, by some means, now at last I may find a way in the will of God to come to you. 

###### 11 
For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, so that you may be established-- 

###### 12 
that is, that I may be encouraged together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me. 

###### 13 
Now I do not want you to be unaware, brethren, that I often planned to come to you (but was hindered until now), that I might have some fruit among you also, just as among the other Gentiles. 

###### 14 
I am a debtor both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to wise and to unwise. 

###### 15 
So, as much as is in me, _I am_ ready to preach the gospel to you who are in Rome also. ## The Just Live by Faith 

###### 16 
For I am not ashamed of the gospel [^c]of Christ, for it is the power of God to salvation for everyone who believes, for the Jew first and also for the Greek. 

###### 17 
For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith; as it is written, "The just shall live by faith." ## God's Wrath on Unrighteousness 

###### 18 
For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who [^d]suppress the truth in unrighteousness, 

###### 19 
because what may be known of God is [^e]manifest [^f]in them, for God has shown _it_ to them. 

###### 20 
For since the creation of the world His invisible _attributes_ are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, _even_ His eternal power and [^g]Godhead, so that they are without excuse, 

###### 21 
because, although they knew God, they did not glorify _Him_ as God, nor were thankful, but became futile in their thoughts, and their foolish hearts were darkened. 

###### 22 
Professing to be wise, they became fools, 

###### 23 
and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like [^h]corruptible man--and birds and four-footed animals and creeping things. 

###### 24 
Therefore God also gave them up to uncleanness, in the lusts of their hearts, to dishonor their bodies among themselves, 

###### 25 
who exchanged the truth of God for the lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen. 

###### 26 
For this reason God gave them up to vile passions. For even their [^i]women exchanged the natural use for what is against nature. 

###### 27 
Likewise also the [^j]men, leaving the natural use of the [^k]woman, burned in their lust for one another, men with men committing what is shameful, and receiving in themselves the penalty of their error which was due. 

###### 28 
And even as they did not like to retain God in _their_ knowledge, God gave them over to a debased mind, to do those things which are not fitting; 

###### 29 
being filled with all unrighteousness, [^l]sexual immorality, wickedness, [^m]covetousness, [^n]maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil-mindedness; _they are_ whisperers, 

###### 30 
backbiters, haters of God, violent, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, 

###### 31 
[^o]undiscerning, untrustworthy, unloving, [^p]unforgiving, unmerciful; 

###### 32 
who, knowing the righteous judgment of God, that those who practice such things are deserving of death, not only do the same but also approve of those who practice them. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

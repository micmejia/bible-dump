# Song of Solomon 4

***


###### 1 
Behold, you _are_ fair, my love! Behold, you _are_ fair! You _have_ dove's eyes behind your veil. Your hair _is_ like a flock of goats, Going down from Mount Gilead. 

###### 2 
Your teeth _are_ like a flock of shorn _sheep_ Which have come up from the washing, Every one of which bears twins, And none _is_ [^a]barren among them. 

###### 3 
Your lips _are_ like a strand of scarlet, And your mouth is lovely. Your temples behind your veil _Are_ like a piece of pomegranate. 

###### 4 
Your neck _is_ like the tower of David, Built for an armory, On which hang a thousand [^b]bucklers, All shields of mighty men. 

###### 5 
Your two breasts _are_ like two fawns, Twins of a gazelle, Which feed among the lilies. 

###### 6 
Until the day breaks And the shadows flee away, I will go my way to the mountain of myrrh And to the hill of frankincense. 

###### 7 
You _are_ all fair, my love, And _there is_ no spot in you. 

###### 8 
Come with me from Lebanon, _my_ spouse, With me from Lebanon. Look from the top of Amana, From the top of Senir and Hermon, From the lions' dens, From the mountains of the leopards. 

###### 9 
You have ravished my heart, My sister, _my_ spouse; You have ravished my heart With one _look_ of your eyes, With one link of your necklace. 

###### 10 
How fair is your love, My sister, _my_ spouse! How much better than wine is your love, And the [^c]scent of your perfumes Than all spices! 

###### 11 
Your lips, O _my_ spouse, Drip as the honeycomb; Honey and milk _are_ under your tongue; And the fragrance of your garments _Is_ like the fragrance of Lebanon. 

###### 12 
A garden [^d]enclosed _Is_ my sister, _my_ spouse, A spring shut up, A fountain sealed. 

###### 13 
Your plants _are_ an orchard of pomegranates With pleasant fruits, Fragrant henna with spikenard, 

###### 14 
Spikenard and saffron, Calamus and cinnamon, With all trees of frankincense, Myrrh and aloes, With all the chief spices-- 

###### 15 
A fountain of gardens, A well of living waters, And streams from Lebanon. 

###### 16 
Awake, O north _wind,_ And come, O south! Blow upon my garden, _That_ its spices may flow out. Let my beloved come to his garden And eat its pleasant fruits. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

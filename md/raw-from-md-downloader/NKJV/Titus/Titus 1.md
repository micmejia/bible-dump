# Titus 1

***


###### 1 
Paul, a bondservant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect and the acknowledgment of the truth which accords with godliness, 

###### 2 
in hope of eternal life which God, who cannot lie, promised before time began, 

###### 3 
but has in due time manifested His word through preaching, which was committed to me according to the commandment of God our Savior; 

###### 4 
To Titus, a true son in _our_ common faith: Grace, mercy, _and_ peace from God the Father and [^a]the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior. ## Qualified Elders 

###### 5 
For this reason I left you in Crete, that you should set in order the things that are lacking, and appoint elders in every city as I commanded you-- 

###### 6 
if a man is blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of [^b]dissipation or insubordination. 

###### 7 
For a [^c]bishop must be blameless, as a steward of God, not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for money, 

###### 8 
but hospitable, a lover of what is good, sober-minded, just, holy, self-controlled, 

###### 9 
holding fast the faithful word as he has been taught, that he may be able, by sound doctrine, both to exhort and convict those who contradict. ## The Elders' Task 

###### 10 
For there are many insubordinate, both idle talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision, 

###### 11 
whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole households, teaching things which they ought not, for the sake of dishonest gain. 

###### 12 
One of them, a prophet of their own, said, "Cretans _are_ always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons." 

###### 13 
This testimony is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith, 

###### 14 
not giving heed to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn from the truth. 

###### 15 
To the pure all things are pure, but to those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure; but even their mind and conscience are defiled. 

###### 16 
They profess to know God, but in works they deny _Him,_ being [^d]abominable, disobedient, and disqualified for every good work. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Zechariah 4

***


###### 1 
Now the angel who talked with me came back and wakened me, as a man who is wakened out of his sleep. 

###### 2 
And he said to me, "What do you see?" So I said, "I am looking, and there _is_ a lampstand of solid gold with a bowl on top of it, and on the _stand_ seven lamps with seven pipes to the seven lamps. 

###### 3 
Two olive trees _are_ by it, one at the right of the bowl and the other at its left." 

###### 4 
So I answered and spoke to the angel who talked with me, saying, "What _are_ these, my lord?" 

###### 5 
Then the angel who talked with me answered and said to me, "Do you not know what these are?" And I said, "No, my lord." 

###### 6 
So he answered and said to me: "This _is_ the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel: 'Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,' Says the Lord of hosts. 

###### 7 
'Who _are_ you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel _you shall become_ a plain! And he shall bring forth the capstone With shouts of "Grace, grace to it!" ' " 

###### 8 
Moreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying: 

###### 9 
"The hands of Zerubbabel Have laid the foundation of this [^a]temple; His hands shall also finish _it._ Then you will know That the Lord of hosts has sent Me to you. 

###### 10 
For who has despised the day of small things? For these seven rejoice to see The [^b]plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel. They are the eyes of the Lord, Which scan to and fro throughout the whole earth." 

###### 11 
Then I answered and said to him, "What _are_ these two olive trees--at the right of the lampstand and at its left?" 

###### 12 
And I further answered and said to him, "What _are these_ two olive branches that _drip_ [^c]into the receptacles of the two gold pipes from which the golden _oil_ drains?" 

###### 13 
Then he answered me and said, "Do you not know what these _are?_" And I said, "No, my lord." 

###### 14 
So he said, "These _are_ the two [^d]anointed ones, who stand beside the Lord of the whole earth." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

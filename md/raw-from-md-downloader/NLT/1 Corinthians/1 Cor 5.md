# 1 Corinthians 5

***




###### 1 

I can hardly believe the report about the sexual immorality going on among you--something that even pagans don't do. I am told that a man in your church is living in sin with his stepmother.[^a] 



###### 2 

You are so proud of yourselves, but you should be mourning in sorrow and shame. And you should remove this man from your fellowship. 



###### 3 

Even though I am not with you in person, I am with you in the Spirit.[^b] And as though I were there, I have already passed judgment on this man 



###### 4 

in the name of the Lord Jesus. You must call a meeting of the church.[^c] I will be present with you in spirit, and so will the power of our Lord Jesus. 



###### 5 

Then you must throw this man out and hand him over to Satan so that his sinful nature will be destroyed[^d] and he himself[^e] will be saved on the day the Lord[^f] returns. 



###### 6 

Your boasting about this is terrible. Don't you realize that this sin is like a little yeast that spreads through the whole batch of dough? 



###### 7 

Get rid of the old "yeast" by removing this wicked person from among you. Then you will be like a fresh batch of dough made without yeast, which is what you really are. Christ, our Passover Lamb, has been sacrificed for us.[^g] 



###### 8 

So let us celebrate the festival, not with the old bread[^h] of wickedness and evil, but with the new bread[^i] of sincerity and truth. 



###### 9 

When I wrote to you before, I told you not to associate with people who indulge in sexual sin. 



###### 10 

But I wasn't talking about unbelievers who indulge in sexual sin, or are greedy, or cheat people, or worship idols. You would have to leave this world to avoid people like that. 



###### 11 

I meant that you are not to associate with anyone who claims to be a believer[^j] yet indulges in sexual sin, or is greedy, or worships idols, or is abusive, or is a drunkard, or cheats people. Don't even eat with such people. 



###### 12 

It isn't my responsibility to judge outsiders, but it certainly is your responsibility to judge those inside the church who are sinning. 



###### 13 

God will judge those on the outside; but as the Scriptures say, "You must remove the evil person from among you."[^k] ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

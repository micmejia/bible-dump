# 1 Samuel 3

***




###### 1 

Meanwhile, the boy Samuel served the LORD by assisting Eli. Now in those days messages from the LORD were very rare, and visions were quite uncommon. 



###### 2 

One night Eli, who was almost blind by now, had gone to bed. 



###### 3 

The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was sleeping in the Tabernacle[^a] near the Ark of God. 



###### 4 

Suddenly the LORD called out, "Samuel!" "Yes?" Samuel replied. "What is it?" 



###### 5 

He got up and ran to Eli. "Here I am. Did you call me?" "I didn't call you," Eli replied. "Go back to bed." So he did. 



###### 6 

Then the LORD called out again, "Samuel!" Again Samuel got up and went to Eli. "Here I am. Did you call me?" "I didn't call you, my son," Eli said. "Go back to bed." 



###### 7 

Samuel did not yet know the LORD because he had never had a message from the LORD before. 



###### 8 

So the LORD called a third time, and once more Samuel got up and went to Eli. "Here I am. Did you call me?" Then Eli realized it was the LORD who was calling the boy. 



###### 9 

So he said to Samuel, "Go and lie down again, and if someone calls again, say, 'Speak, LORD, your servant is listening.'" So Samuel went back to bed. 



###### 10 

And the LORD came and called as before, "Samuel! Samuel!" And Samuel replied, "Speak, your servant is listening." 



###### 11 

Then the LORD said to Samuel, "I am about to do a shocking thing in Israel. 



###### 12 

I am going to carry out all my threats against Eli and his family, from beginning to end. 



###### 13 

I have warned him that judgment is coming upon his family forever, because his sons are blaspheming God[^b] and he hasn't disciplined them. 



###### 14 

So I have vowed that the sins of Eli and his sons will never be forgiven by sacrifices or offerings." ## Samuel Speaks for the LORD 



###### 15 

Samuel stayed in bed until morning, then got up and opened the doors of the Tabernacle[^c] as usual. He was afraid to tell Eli what the LORD had said to him. 



###### 16 

But Eli called out to him, "Samuel, my son." "Here I am," Samuel replied. 



###### 17 

"What did the LORD say to you? Tell me everything. And may God strike you and even kill you if you hide anything from me!" 



###### 18 

So Samuel told Eli everything; he didn't hold anything back. "It is the LORD's will," Eli replied. "Let him do what he thinks best." 



###### 19 

As Samuel grew up, the LORD was with him, and everything Samuel said proved to be reliable. 



###### 20 

And all Israel, from Dan in the north to Beersheba in the south, knew that Samuel was confirmed as a prophet of the LORD. 



###### 21 

The LORD continued to appear at Shiloh and gave messages to Samuel there at the Tabernacle. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# 1 Timothy 2

***




###### 1 

I urge you, first of all, to pray for all people. Ask God to help them; intercede on their behalf, and give thanks for them. 



###### 2 

Pray this way for kings and all who are in authority so that we can live peaceful and quiet lives marked by godliness and dignity. 



###### 3 

This is good and pleases God our Savior, 



###### 4 

who wants everyone to be saved and to understand the truth. 



###### 5 

For, There is one God and one Mediator who can reconcile God and humanity--the man Christ Jesus. 



###### 6 

He gave his life to purchase freedom for everyone. This is the message God gave to the world at just the right time. 



###### 7 

And I have been chosen as a preacher and apostle to teach the Gentiles this message about faith and truth. I'm not exaggerating--just telling the truth. 



###### 8 

In every place of worship, I want men to pray with holy hands lifted up to God, free from anger and controversy. 



###### 9 

And I want women to be modest in their appearance.[^a] They should wear decent and appropriate clothing and not draw attention to themselves by the way they fix their hair or by wearing gold or pearls or expensive clothes. 



###### 10 

For women who claim to be devoted to God should make themselves attractive by the good things they do. 



###### 11 

Women should learn quietly and submissively. 



###### 12 

I do not let women teach men or have authority over them.[^b] Let them listen quietly. 



###### 13 

For God made Adam first, and afterward he made Eve. 



###### 14 

And it was not Adam who was deceived by Satan. The woman was deceived, and sin was the result. 



###### 15 

But women will be saved through childbearing,[^c] assuming they continue to live in faith, love, holiness, and modesty. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

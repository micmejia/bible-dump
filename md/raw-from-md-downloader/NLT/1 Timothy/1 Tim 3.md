# 1 Timothy 3

***




###### 1 

This is a trustworthy saying: "If someone aspires to be a church leader,[^a] he desires an honorable position." 



###### 2 

So a church leader must be a man whose life is above reproach. He must be faithful to his wife.[^b] He must exercise self-control, live wisely, and have a good reputation. He must enjoy having guests in his home, and he must be able to teach. 



###### 3 

He must not be a heavy drinker[^c] or be violent. He must be gentle, not quarrelsome, and not love money. 



###### 4 

He must manage his own family well, having children who respect and obey him. 



###### 5 

For if a man cannot manage his own household, how can he take care of God's church? 



###### 6 

A church leader must not be a new believer, because he might become proud, and the devil would cause him to fall.[^d] 



###### 7 

Also, people outside the church must speak well of him so that he will not be disgraced and fall into the devil's trap. 



###### 8 

In the same way, deacons must be well respected and have integrity. They must not be heavy drinkers or dishonest with money. 



###### 9 

They must be committed to the mystery of the faith now revealed and must live with a clear conscience. 



###### 10 

Before they are appointed as deacons, let them be closely examined. If they pass the test, then let them serve as deacons. 



###### 11 

In the same way, their wives[^e] must be respected and must not slander others. They must exercise self-control and be faithful in everything they do. 



###### 12 

A deacon must be faithful to his wife, and he must manage his children and household well. 



###### 13 

Those who do well as deacons will be rewarded with respect from others and will have increased confidence in their faith in Christ Jesus. ## The Truths of Our Faith 



###### 14 

I am writing these things to you now, even though I hope to be with you soon, 



###### 15 

so that if I am delayed, you will know how people must conduct themselves in the household of God. This is the church of the living God, which is the pillar and foundation of the truth. 



###### 16 

Without question, this is the great mystery of our faith[^f]: Christ[^g] was revealed in a human body and vindicated by the Spirit.[^h] He was seen by angels and announced to the nations. He was believed in throughout the world and taken to heaven in glory. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

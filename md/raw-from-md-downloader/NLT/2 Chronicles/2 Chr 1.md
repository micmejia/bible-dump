# 2 Chronicles 1

***




###### 1 

Solomon son of David took firm control of his kingdom, for the LORD his God was with him and made him very powerful. 



###### 2 

Solomon called together all the leaders of Israel--the generals and captains of the army,[^a] the judges, and all the political and clan leaders. 



###### 3 

Then he led the entire assembly to the place of worship in Gibeon, for God's Tabernacle[^b] was located there. (This was the Tabernacle that Moses, the LORD's servant, had made in the wilderness.) 



###### 4 

David had already moved the Ark of God from Kiriath-jearim to the tent he had prepared for it in Jerusalem. 



###### 5 

But the bronze altar made by Bezalel son of Uri and grandson of Hur was there[^c] at Gibeon in front of the Tabernacle of the LORD. So Solomon and the people gathered in front of it to consult the LORD.[^d] 



###### 6 

There in front of the Tabernacle, Solomon went up to the bronze altar in the LORD's presence and sacrificed 1,000 burnt offerings on it. 



###### 7 

That night God appeared to Solomon and said, "What do you want? Ask, and I will give it to you!" 



###### 8 

Solomon replied to God, "You showed great and faithful love to David, my father, and now you have made me king in his place. 



###### 9 

O LORD God, please continue to keep your promise to David my father, for you have made me king over a people as numerous as the dust of the earth! 



###### 10 

Give me the wisdom and knowledge to lead them properly,[^e] for who could possibly govern this great people of yours?" 



###### 11 

God said to Solomon, "Because your greatest desire is to help your people, and you did not ask for wealth, riches, fame, or even the death of your enemies or a long life, but rather you asked for wisdom and knowledge to properly govern my people-- 



###### 12 

I will certainly give you the wisdom and knowledge you requested. But I will also give you wealth, riches, and fame such as no other king has had before you or will ever have in the future!" 



###### 13 

Then Solomon returned to Jerusalem from the Tabernacle at the place of worship in Gibeon, and he reigned over Israel. 



###### 14 

Solomon built up a huge force of chariots and horses.[^f] He had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horses. He stationed some of them in the chariot cities and some near him in Jerusalem. 



###### 15 

The king made silver and gold as plentiful in Jerusalem as stone. And valuable cedar timber was as common as the sycamore-fig trees that grow in the foothills of Judah.[^g] 



###### 16 

Solomon's horses were imported from Egypt[^h] and from Cilicia[^i]; the king's traders acquired them from Cilicia at the standard price. 



###### 17 

At that time chariots from Egypt could be purchased for 600 pieces of silver,[^j] and horses for 150 pieces of silver.[^k] They were then exported to the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Aram. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

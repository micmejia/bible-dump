# 2 Thessalonians 3

***




###### 1 

Finally, dear brothers and sisters,[^a] we ask you to pray for us. Pray that the Lord's message will spread rapidly and be honored wherever it goes, just as when it came to you. 



###### 2 

Pray, too, that we will be rescued from wicked and evil people, for not everyone is a believer. 



###### 3 

But the Lord is faithful; he will strengthen you and guard you from the evil one.[^b] 



###### 4 

And we are confident in the Lord that you are doing and will continue to do the things we commanded you. 



###### 5 

May the Lord lead your hearts into a full understanding and expression of the love of God and the patient endurance that comes from Christ. ## An Exhortation to Proper Living 



###### 6 

And now, dear brothers and sisters, we give you this command in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ: Stay away from all believers[^c] who live idle lives and don't follow the tradition they received[^d] from us. 



###### 7 

For you know that you ought to imitate us. We were not idle when we were with you. 



###### 8 

We never accepted food from anyone without paying for it. We worked hard day and night so we would not be a burden to any of you. 



###### 9 

We certainly had the right to ask you to feed us, but we wanted to give you an example to follow. 



###### 10 

Even while we were with you, we gave you this command: "Those unwilling to work will not get to eat." 



###### 11 

Yet we hear that some of you are living idle lives, refusing to work and meddling in other people's business. 



###### 12 

We command such people and urge them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to settle down and work to earn their own living. 



###### 13 

As for the rest of you, dear brothers and sisters, never get tired of doing good. 



###### 14 

Take note of those who refuse to obey what we say in this letter. Stay away from them so they will be ashamed. 



###### 15 

Don't think of them as enemies, but warn them as you would a brother or sister.[^e] ## Paul's Final Greetings 



###### 16 

Now may the Lord of peace himself give you his peace at all times and in every situation. The Lord be with you all. 



###### 17 

HERE IS MY GREETING IN MY OWN HANDWRITING--PAUL. I DO THIS IN ALL MY LETTERS TO PROVE THEY ARE FROM ME. 



###### 18 

May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

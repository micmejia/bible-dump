# Acts 22

***




###### 1 

"Brothers and esteemed fathers," Paul said, "listen to me as I offer my defense." 



###### 2 

When they heard him speaking in their own language,[^a] the silence was even greater. 



###### 3 

Then Paul said, "I am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, and I was brought up and educated here in Jerusalem under Gamaliel. As his student, I was carefully trained in our Jewish laws and customs. I became very zealous to honor God in everything I did, just like all of you today. 



###### 4 

And I persecuted the followers of the Way, hounding some to death, arresting both men and women and throwing them in prison. 



###### 5 

The high priest and the whole council of elders can testify that this is so. For I received letters from them to our Jewish brothers in Damascus, authorizing me to bring the followers of the Way from there to Jerusalem, in chains, to be punished. 



###### 6 

"As I was on the road, approaching Damascus about noon, a very bright light from heaven suddenly shone down around me. 



###### 7 

I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?' 



###### 8 

"'Who are you, lord?' I asked. "And the voice replied, 'I am Jesus the Nazarene,[^b] the one you are persecuting.' 



###### 9 

The people with me saw the light but didn't understand the voice speaking to me. 



###### 10 

"I asked, 'What should I do, Lord?' "And the Lord told me, 'Get up and go into Damascus, and there you will be told everything you are to do.' 



###### 11 

"I was blinded by the intense light and had to be led by the hand to Damascus by my companions. 



###### 12 

A man named Ananias lived there. He was a godly man, deeply devoted to the law, and well regarded by all the Jews of Damascus. 



###### 13 

He came and stood beside me and said, 'Brother Saul, regain your sight.' And that very moment I could see him! 



###### 14 

"Then he told me, 'The God of our ancestors has chosen you to know his will and to see the Righteous One and hear him speak. 



###### 15 

For you are to be his witness, telling everyone what you have seen and heard. 



###### 16 

What are you waiting for? Get up and be baptized. Have your sins washed away by calling on the name of the Lord.' 



###### 17 

"After I returned to Jerusalem, I was praying in the Temple and fell into a trance. 



###### 18 

I saw a vision of Jesus[^c] saying to me, 'Hurry! Leave Jerusalem, for the people here won't accept your testimony about me.' 



###### 19 

"'But Lord,' I argued, 'they certainly know that in every synagogue I imprisoned and beat those who believed in you. 



###### 20 

And I was in complete agreement when your witness Stephen was killed. I stood by and kept the coats they took off when they stoned him.' 



###### 21 

"But the Lord said to me, 'Go, for I will send you far away to the Gentiles!'" 



###### 22 

The crowd listened until Paul said that word. Then they all began to shout, "Away with such a fellow! He isn't fit to live!" 



###### 23 

They yelled, threw off their coats, and tossed handfuls of dust into the air. ## Paul Reveals His Roman Citizenship 



###### 24 

The commander brought Paul inside and ordered him lashed with whips to make him confess his crime. He wanted to find out why the crowd had become so furious. 



###### 25 

When they tied Paul down to lash him, Paul said to the officer[^d] standing there, "Is it legal for you to whip a Roman citizen who hasn't even been tried?" 



###### 26 

When the officer heard this, he went to the commander and asked, "What are you doing? This man is a Roman citizen!" 



###### 27 

So the commander went over and asked Paul, "Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?" "Yes, I certainly am," Paul replied. 



###### 28 

"I am, too," the commander muttered, "and it cost me plenty!" Paul answered, "But I am a citizen by birth!" 



###### 29 

The soldiers who were about to interrogate Paul quickly withdrew when they heard he was a Roman citizen, and the commander was frightened because he had ordered him bound and whipped. ## Paul before the High Council 



###### 30 

The next day the commander ordered the leading priests into session with the Jewish high council.[^e] He wanted to find out what the trouble was all about, so he released Paul to have him stand before them. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Deuteronomy 34

***




###### 1 

Then Moses went up to Mount Nebo from the plains of Moab and climbed Pisgah Peak, which is across from Jericho. And the LORD showed him the whole land, from Gilead as far as Dan; 



###### 2 

all the land of Naphtali; the land of Ephraim and Manasseh; all the land of Judah, extending to the Mediterranean Sea[^a]; 



###### 3 

the Negev; the Jordan Valley with Jericho--the city of palms--as far as Zoar. 



###### 4 

Then the LORD said to Moses, "This is the land I promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob when I said, 'I will give it to your descendants.' I have now allowed you to see it with your own eyes, but you will not enter the land." 



###### 5 

So Moses, the servant of the LORD, died there in the land of Moab, just as the LORD had said. 



###### 6 

The LORD buried him[^b] in a valley near Beth-peor in Moab, but to this day no one knows the exact place. 



###### 7 

Moses was 120 years old when he died, yet his eyesight was clear, and he was as strong as ever. 



###### 8 

The people of Israel mourned for Moses on the plains of Moab for thirty days, until the customary period of mourning was over. 



###### 9 

Now Joshua son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands on him. So the people of Israel obeyed him, doing just as the LORD had commanded Moses. 



###### 10 

There has never been another prophet in Israel like Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face. 



###### 11 

The LORD sent him to perform all the miraculous signs and wonders in the land of Egypt against Pharaoh, and all his servants, and his entire land. 



###### 12 

With mighty power, Moses performed terrifying acts in the sight of all Israel. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Ecclesiastes 4

***




###### 1 

Again, I observed all the oppression that takes place under the sun. I saw the tears of the oppressed, with no one to comfort them. The oppressors have great power, and their victims are helpless. 



###### 2 

So I concluded that the dead are better off than the living. 



###### 3 

But most fortunate of all are those who are not yet born. For they have not seen all the evil that is done under the sun. 



###### 4 

Then I observed that most people are motivated to success because they envy their neighbors. But this, too, is meaningless--like chasing the wind. 



###### 5 

"Fools fold their idle hands, leading them to ruin." 



###### 6 

And yet, "Better to have one handful with quietness than two handfuls with hard work and chasing the wind." ## The Advantages of Companionship 



###### 7 

I observed yet another example of something meaningless under the sun. 



###### 8 

This is the case of a man who is all alone, without a child or a brother, yet who works hard to gain as much wealth as he can. But then he asks himself, "Who am I working for? Why am I giving up so much pleasure now?" It is all so meaningless and depressing. 



###### 9 

Two people are better off than one, for they can help each other succeed. 



###### 10 

If one person falls, the other can reach out and help. But someone who falls alone is in real trouble. 



###### 11 

Likewise, two people lying close together can keep each other warm. But how can one be warm alone? 



###### 12 

A person standing alone can be attacked and defeated, but two can stand back-to-back and conquer. Three are even better, for a triple-braided cord is not easily broken. ## The Futility of Political Power 



###### 13 

It is better to be a poor but wise youth than an old and foolish king who refuses all advice. 



###### 14 

Such a youth could rise from poverty and succeed. He might even become king, though he has been in prison. 



###### 15 

But then everyone rushes to the side of yet another youth[^a] who replaces him. 



###### 16 

Endless crowds stand around him,[^b] but then another generation grows up and rejects him, too. So it is all meaningless--like chasing the wind. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

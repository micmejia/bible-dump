# Exodus 6

***




###### 1 

Then the LORD told Moses, "Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh. When he feels the force of my strong hand, he will let the people go. In fact, he will force them to leave his land!" 



###### 2 

And God said to Moses, "I am Yahweh--'the LORD.'[^a] 



###### 3 

I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as El-Shaddai--'God Almighty'[^b]--but I did not reveal my name, Yahweh, to them. 



###### 4 

And I reaffirmed my covenant with them. Under its terms, I promised to give them the land of Canaan, where they were living as foreigners. 



###### 5 

You can be sure that I have heard the groans of the people of Israel, who are now slaves to the Egyptians. And I am well aware of my covenant with them. 



###### 6 

"Therefore, say to the people of Israel: 'I am the LORD. I will free you from your oppression and will rescue you from your slavery in Egypt. I will redeem you with a powerful arm and great acts of judgment. 



###### 7 

I will claim you as my own people, and I will be your God. Then you will know that I am the LORD your God who has freed you from your oppression in Egypt. 



###### 8 

I will bring you into the land I swore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I will give it to you as your very own possession. I am the LORD!'" 



###### 9 

So Moses told the people of Israel what the LORD had said, but they refused to listen anymore. They had become too discouraged by the brutality of their slavery. 



###### 10 

Then the LORD said to Moses, 



###### 11 

"Go back to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and tell him to let the people of Israel leave his country." 



###### 12 

"But LORD!" Moses objected. "My own people won't listen to me anymore. How can I expect Pharaoh to listen? I'm such a clumsy speaker![^c]" 



###### 13 

But the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron and gave them orders for the Israelites and for Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. The LORD commanded Moses and Aaron to lead the people of Israel out of Egypt. ## The Ancestors of Moses and Aaron

The descendants of Gershon included Libni and Shimei, each of whom became the ancestor of a clan.

The Aaron and Moses named in this list are the same ones to whom the LORD said, "Lead the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt like an army."

It was Moses and Aaron who spoke to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, about leading the people of Israel out of Egypt.

he said to him, "I am the LORD! Tell Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, everything I am telling you." 



###### 30 

But Moses argued with the LORD, saying, "I can't do it! I'm such a clumsy speaker! Why should Pharaoh listen to me?" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

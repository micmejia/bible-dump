# Ezekiel 15

***




###### 1 

Then this message came to me from the LORD: 



###### 2 

"Son of man, how does a grapevine compare to a tree? Is a vine's wood as useful as the wood of a tree? 



###### 3 

Can its wood be used for making things, like pegs to hang up pots and pans? 



###### 4 

No, it can only be used for fuel, and even as fuel, it burns too quickly. 



###### 5 

Vines are useless both before and after being put into the fire! 



###### 6 

"And this is what the Sovereign LORD says: The people of Jerusalem are like grapevines growing among the trees of the forest. Since they are useless, I have thrown them on the fire to be burned. 



###### 7 

And I will see to it that if they escape from one fire, they will fall into another. When I turn against them, you will know that I am the LORD. 



###### 8 

And I will make the land desolate because my people have been unfaithful to me. I, the Sovereign LORD, have spoken!" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

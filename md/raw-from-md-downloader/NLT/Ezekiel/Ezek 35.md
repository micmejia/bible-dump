# Ezekiel 35

***




###### 1 

Again a message came to me from the LORD: 



###### 2 

"Son of man, turn and face Mount Seir, and prophesy against its people. 



###### 3 

Give them this message from the Sovereign LORD: "I am your enemy, O Mount Seir, and I will raise my fist against you to destroy you completely. 



###### 4 

I will demolish your cities and make you desolate. Then you will know that I am the LORD. 



###### 5 

"Your eternal hatred for the people of Israel led you to butcher them when they were helpless, when I had already punished them for all their sins. 



###### 6 

As surely as I live, says the Sovereign LORD, since you show no distaste for blood, I will give you a bloodbath of your own. Your turn has come! 



###### 7 

I will make Mount Seir utterly desolate, killing off all who try to escape and any who return. 



###### 8 

I will fill your mountains with the dead. Your hills, your valleys, and your ravines will be filled with people slaughtered by the sword. 



###### 9 

I will make you desolate forever. Your cities will never be rebuilt. Then you will know that I am the LORD. 



###### 10 

"For you said, 'The lands of Israel and Judah will be ours. We will take possession of them. What do we care that the LORD is there!' 



###### 11 

Therefore, as surely as I live, says the Sovereign LORD, I will pay back your angry deeds with my own. I will punish you for all your acts of anger, envy, and hatred. And I will make myself known to Israel[^a] by what I do to you. 



###### 12 

Then you will know that I, the LORD, have heard every contemptuous word you spoke against the mountains of Israel. For you said, 'They are desolate; they have been given to us as food to eat!' 



###### 13 

In saying that, you boasted proudly against me, and I have heard it all! 



###### 14 

"This is what the Sovereign LORD says: The whole world will rejoice when I make you desolate. 



###### 15 

You rejoiced at the desolation of Israel's territory. Now I will rejoice at yours! You will be wiped out, you people of Mount Seir and all who live in Edom! Then you will know that I am the LORD. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

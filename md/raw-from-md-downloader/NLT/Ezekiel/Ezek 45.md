# Ezekiel 45

***




###### 1 

"When you divide the land among the tribes of Israel, you must set aside a section for the LORD as his holy portion. This piece of land will be 8 1⁄3 miles long and 6 2⁄3 miles wide.[^a] The entire area will be holy. 



###### 2 

A section of this land, measuring 875 feet by 875 feet,[^b] will be set aside for the Temple. An additional strip of land 87 1⁄2 feet[^c] wide is to be left empty all around it. 



###### 3 

Within the larger sacred area, measure out a portion of land 8 1⁄3 miles long and 3 1⁄3 miles wide.[^d] Within it the sanctuary of the Most Holy Place will be located. 



###### 4 

This area will be holy, set aside for the priests who minister to the LORD in the sanctuary. They will use it for their homes, and my Temple will be located within it. 



###### 5 

The strip of sacred land next to it, also 8 1⁄3 miles long and 3 1⁄3 miles wide, will be a living area for the Levites who work at the Temple. It will be their possession and a place for their towns.[^e] 



###### 6 

"Adjacent to the larger sacred area will be a section of land 8 1⁄3 miles long and 1 2⁄3 miles wide.[^f] This will be set aside for a city where anyone in Israel can live. 



###### 7 

"Two special sections of land will be set apart for the prince. One section will share a border with the east side of the sacred lands and city, and the second section will share a border on the west side. Then the far eastern and western borders of the prince's lands will line up with the eastern and western boundaries of the tribal areas. 



###### 8 

These sections of land will be the prince's allotment. Then my princes will no longer oppress and rob my people; they will assign the rest of the land to the people, giving an allotment to each tribe. ## Rules for the Princes 



###### 9 

"For this is what the Sovereign LORD says: Enough, you princes of Israel! Stop your violence and oppression and do what is just and right. Quit robbing and cheating my people out of their land. Stop expelling them from their homes, says the Sovereign LORD. 



###### 10 

Use only honest weights and scales and honest measures, both dry and liquid.[^g] 



###### 11 

The homer[^h] will be your standard unit for measuring volume. The ephah and the bath[^i] will each measure one-tenth of a homer. 



###### 12 

The standard unit for weight will be the silver shekel.[^j] One shekel will consist of twenty gerahs, and sixty shekels will be equal to one mina.[^k] ## Special Offerings and Celebrations 



###### 13 

"You must give this tax to the prince: one bushel of wheat or barley for every 60[^l] you harvest, 



###### 14 

one percent of your olive oil,[^m] 



###### 15 

and one sheep or goat for every 200 in your flocks in Israel. These will be the grain offerings, burnt offerings, and peace offerings that will make atonement for the people who bring them, says the Sovereign LORD. 



###### 16 

All the people of Israel must join in bringing these offerings to the prince. 



###### 17 

The prince will be required to provide offerings that are given at the religious festivals, the new moon celebrations, the Sabbath days, and all other similar occasions. He will provide the sin offerings, burnt offerings, grain offerings, liquid offerings, and peace offerings to purify the people of Israel, making them right with the LORD.[^n] 



###### 18 

"This is what the Sovereign LORD says: In early spring, on the first day of each new year,[^o] sacrifice a young bull with no defects to purify the Temple. 



###### 19 

The priest will take blood from this sin offering and put it on the doorposts of the Temple, the four corners of the upper ledge of the altar, and the gateposts at the entrance to the inner courtyard. 



###### 20 

Do this also on the seventh day of the new year for anyone who has sinned through error or ignorance. In this way, you will purify[^p] the Temple. 



###### 21 

"On the fourteenth day of the first month,[^q] you must celebrate the Passover. This festival will last for seven days. The bread you eat during that time must be made without yeast. 



###### 22 

On the day of Passover the prince will provide a young bull as a sin offering for himself and the people of Israel. 



###### 23 

On each of the seven days of the feast he will prepare a burnt offering to the LORD, consisting of seven young bulls and seven rams without defects. A male goat will also be given each day for a sin offering. 



###### 24 

The prince will provide a basket of flour as a grain offering and a gallon of olive oil[^r] with each young bull and ram. 



###### 25 

"During the seven days of the Festival of Shelters, which occurs every year in early autumn,[^s] the prince will provide these same sacrifices for the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the grain offering, along with the required olive oil. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

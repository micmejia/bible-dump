# Ezra 3

***




###### 1 

In early autumn,[^a] when the Israelites had settled in their towns, all the people assembled in Jerusalem with a unified purpose. 



###### 2 

Then Jeshua son of Jehozadak[^b] joined his fellow priests and Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel with his family in rebuilding the altar of the God of Israel. They wanted to sacrifice burnt offerings on it, as instructed in the Law of Moses, the man of God. 



###### 3 

Even though the people were afraid of the local residents, they rebuilt the altar at its old site. Then they began to sacrifice burnt offerings on the altar to the LORD each morning and evening. 



###### 4 

They celebrated the Festival of Shelters as prescribed in the Law, sacrificing the number of burnt offerings specified for each day of the festival. 



###### 5 

They also offered the regular burnt offerings and the offerings required for the new moon celebrations and the annual festivals as prescribed by the LORD. The people also gave voluntary offerings to the LORD. 



###### 6 

Fifteen days before the Festival of Shelters began,[^c] the priests had begun to sacrifice burnt offerings to the LORD. This was even before they had started to lay the foundation of the LORD's Temple. ## The People Begin to Rebuild the Temple 



###### 7 

Then the people hired masons and carpenters and bought cedar logs from the people of Tyre and Sidon, paying them with food, wine, and olive oil. The logs were brought down from the Lebanon mountains and floated along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea[^d] to Joppa, for King Cyrus had given permission for this. 



###### 8 

The construction of the Temple of God began in midspring,[^e] during the second year after they arrived in Jerusalem. The work force was made up of everyone who had returned from exile, including Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, Jeshua son of Jehozadak and his fellow priests, and all the Levites. The Levites who were twenty years old or older were put in charge of rebuilding the LORD's Temple. 



###### 9 

The workers at the Temple of God were supervised by Jeshua with his sons and relatives, and Kadmiel and his sons, all descendants of Hodaviah.[^f] They were helped in this task by the Levites of the family of Henadad. 



###### 10 

When the builders completed the foundation of the LORD's Temple, the priests put on their robes and took their places to blow their trumpets. And the Levites, descendants of Asaph, clashed their cymbals to praise the LORD, just as King David had prescribed. 



###### 11 

With praise and thanks, they sang this song to the LORD: "He is so good! His faithful love for Israel endures forever!" Then all the people gave a great shout, praising the LORD because the foundation of the LORD's Temple had been laid. 



###### 12 

But many of the older priests, Levites, and other leaders who had seen the first Temple wept aloud when they saw the new Temple's foundation. The others, however, were shouting for joy. 



###### 13 

The joyful shouting and weeping mingled together in a loud noise that could be heard far in the distance. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

The seventh month of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred within the months of September/October 538 B.c. and October/November 537 B.c. [^b]: 3:2 Hebrew _Jozadak,_ a variant spelling of Jehozadak; also in [3:8]. [^c]: 3:6 Hebrew _On the first day of the seventh month._ This day in the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred in September or October. The Festival of Shelters began on the fifteenth day of the seventh month. [^d]: 3:7 Hebrew _the sea._ [^e]: 3:8 Hebrew _in the second month._ This month in the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred within the months of April and May 536 B.c.

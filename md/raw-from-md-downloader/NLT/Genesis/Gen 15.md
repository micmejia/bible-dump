# Genesis 15

***




###### 1 

Some time later, the LORD spoke to Abram in a vision and said to him, "Do not be afraid, Abram, for I will protect you, and your reward will be great." 



###### 2 

But Abram replied, "O Sovereign LORD, what good are all your blessings when I don't even have a son? Since you've given me no children, Eliezer of Damascus, a servant in my household, will inherit all my wealth. 



###### 3 

You have given me no descendants of my own, so one of my servants will be my heir." 



###### 4 

Then the LORD said to him, "No, your servant will not be your heir, for you will have a son of your own who will be your heir." 



###### 5 

Then the LORD took Abram outside and said to him, "Look up into the sky and count the stars if you can. That's how many descendants you will have!" 



###### 6 

And Abram believed the LORD, and the LORD counted him as righteous because of his faith. 



###### 7 

Then the LORD told him, "I am the LORD who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land as your possession." 



###### 8 

But Abram replied, "O Sovereign LORD, how can I be sure that I will actually possess it?" 



###### 9 

The LORD told him, "Bring me a three-year-old heifer, a three-year-old female goat, a three-year-old ram, a turtledove, and a young pigeon." 



###### 10 

So Abram presented all these to him and killed them. Then he cut each animal down the middle and laid the halves side by side; he did not, however, cut the birds in half. 



###### 11 

Some vultures swooped down to eat the carcasses, but Abram chased them away. 



###### 12 

As the sun was going down, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and a terrifying darkness came down over him. 



###### 13 

Then the LORD said to Abram, "You can be sure that your descendants will be strangers in a foreign land, where they will be oppressed as slaves for 400 years. 



###### 14 

But I will punish the nation that enslaves them, and in the end they will come away with great wealth. 



###### 15 

(As for you, you will die in peace and be buried at a ripe old age.) 



###### 16 

After four generations your descendants will return here to this land, for the sins of the Amorites do not yet warrant their destruction." 



###### 17 

After the sun went down and darkness fell, Abram saw a smoking firepot and a flaming torch pass between the halves of the carcasses. 



###### 18 

So the LORD made a covenant with Abram that day and said, "I have given this land to your descendants, all the way from the border of Egypt[^a] to the great Euphrates River-- 



###### 19 

the land now occupied by the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites, 



###### 20 

Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites, 



###### 21 

Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites, and Jebusites." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

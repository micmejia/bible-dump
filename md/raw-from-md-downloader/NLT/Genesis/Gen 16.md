# Genesis 16

***




###### 1 

Now Sarai, Abram's wife, had not been able to bear children for him. But she had an Egyptian servant named Hagar. 



###### 2 

So Sarai said to Abram, "The LORD has prevented me from having children. Go and sleep with my servant. Perhaps I can have children through her." And Abram agreed with Sarai's proposal. 



###### 3 

So Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar the Egyptian servant and gave her to Abram as a wife. (This happened ten years after Abram had settled in the land of Canaan.) 



###### 4 

So Abram had sexual relations with Hagar, and she became pregnant. But when Hagar knew she was pregnant, she began to treat her mistress, Sarai, with contempt. 



###### 5 

Then Sarai said to Abram, "This is all your fault! I put my servant into your arms, but now that she's pregnant she treats me with contempt. The LORD will show who's wrong--you or me!" 



###### 6 

Abram replied, "Look, she is your servant, so deal with her as you see fit." Then Sarai treated Hagar so harshly that she finally ran away. 



###### 7 

The angel of the LORD found Hagar beside a spring of water in the wilderness, along the road to Shur. 



###### 8 

The angel said to her, "Hagar, Sarai's servant, where have you come from, and where are you going?" "I'm running away from my mistress, Sarai," she replied. 



###### 9 

The angel of the LORD said to her, "Return to your mistress, and submit to her authority." 



###### 10 

Then he added, "I will give you more descendants than you can count." 



###### 11 

And the angel also said, "You are now pregnant and will give birth to a son. You are to name him Ishmael (which means 'God hears'), for the LORD has heard your cry of distress. 



###### 12 

This son of yours will be a wild man, as untamed as a wild donkey! He will raise his fist against everyone, and everyone will be against him. Yes, he will live in open hostility against all his relatives." 



###### 13 

Thereafter, Hagar used another name to refer to the LORD, who had spoken to her. She said, "You are the God who sees me."[^a] She also said, "Have I truly seen the One who sees me?" 



###### 14 

So that well was named Beer-lahai-roi (which means "well of the Living One who sees me"). It can still be found between Kadesh and Bered. 



###### 15 

So Hagar gave Abram a son, and Abram named him Ishmael. 



###### 16 

Abram was eighty-six years old when Ishmael was born. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Hebrews 3

***




###### 1 

And so, dear brothers and sisters who belong to God and[^a] are partners with those called to heaven, think carefully about this Jesus whom we declare to be God's messenger[^b] and High Priest. 



###### 2 

For he was faithful to God, who appointed him, just as Moses served faithfully when he was entrusted with God's entire[^c] house. 



###### 3 

But Jesus deserves far more glory than Moses, just as a person who builds a house deserves more praise than the house itself. 



###### 4 

For every house has a builder, but the one who built everything is God. 



###### 5 

Moses was certainly faithful in God's house as a servant. His work was an illustration of the truths God would reveal later. 



###### 6 

But Christ, as the Son, is in charge of God's entire house. And we are God's house, if we keep our courage and remain confident in our hope in Christ.[^d] 



###### 7 

That is why the Holy Spirit says, "Today when you hear his voice, 



###### 8 

don't harden your hearts as Israel did when they rebelled, when they tested me in the wilderness. 



###### 9 

There your ancestors tested and tried my patience, even though they saw my miracles for forty years. 



###### 10 

So I was angry with them, and I said, 'Their hearts always turn away from me. They refuse to do what I tell them.' 



###### 11 

So in my anger I took an oath: 'They will never enter my place of rest.'"[^e] 



###### 12 

Be careful then, dear brothers and sisters.[^f] Make sure that your own hearts are not evil and unbelieving, turning you away from the living God. 



###### 13 

You must warn each other every day, while it is still "today," so that none of you will be deceived by sin and hardened against God. 



###### 14 

For if we are faithful to the end, trusting God just as firmly as when we first believed, we will share in all that belongs to Christ. 



###### 15 

Remember what it says: "Today when you hear his voice, don't harden your hearts as Israel did when they rebelled."[^g] 



###### 16 

And who was it who rebelled against God, even though they heard his voice? Wasn't it the people Moses led out of Egypt? 



###### 17 

And who made God angry for forty years? Wasn't it the people who sinned, whose corpses lay in the wilderness? 



###### 18 

And to whom was God speaking when he took an oath that they would never enter his rest? Wasn't it the people who disobeyed him? 



###### 19 

So we see that because of their unbelief they were not able to enter his rest. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Hebrews 8

***




###### 1 

Here is the main point: We have a High Priest who sat down in the place of honor beside the throne of the majestic God in heaven. 



###### 2 

There he ministers in the heavenly Tabernacle,[^a] the true place of worship that was built by the Lord and not by human hands. 



###### 3 

And since every high priest is required to offer gifts and sacrifices, our High Priest must make an offering, too. 



###### 4 

If he were here on earth, he would not even be a priest, since there already are priests who offer the gifts required by the law. 



###### 5 

They serve in a system of worship that is only a copy, a shadow of the real one in heaven. For when Moses was getting ready to build the Tabernacle, God gave him this warning: "Be sure that you make everything according to the pattern I have shown you here on the mountain."[^b] 



###### 6 

But now Jesus, our High Priest, has been given a ministry that is far superior to the old priesthood, for he is the one who mediates for us a far better covenant with God, based on better promises. 



###### 7 

If the first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no need for a second covenant to replace it. 



###### 8 

But when God found fault with the people, he said: "The day is coming, says the LORD, when I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and Judah. 



###### 9 

This covenant will not be like the one I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand and led them out of the land of Egypt. They did not remain faithful to my covenant, so I turned my back on them, says the LORD. 



###### 10 

But this is the new covenant I will make with the people of Israel on that day,[^c] says the LORD: I will put my laws in their minds, and I will write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people. 



###### 11 

And they will not need to teach their neighbors, nor will they need to teach their relatives,[^d] saying, 'You should know the LORD.' For everyone, from the least to the greatest, will know me already. 



###### 12 

And I will forgive their wickedness, and I will never again remember their sins."[^e] 



###### 13 

When God speaks of a "new" covenant, it means he has made the first one obsolete. It is now out of date and will soon disappear. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

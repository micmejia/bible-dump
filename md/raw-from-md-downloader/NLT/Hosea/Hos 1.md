# Hosea 1

***




###### 1 

The LORD gave this message to Hosea son of Beeri during the years when Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah were kings of Judah, and Jeroboam son of Jehoash[^a] was king of Israel. ## Hosea's Wife and Children 



###### 2 

When the LORD first began speaking to Israel through Hosea, he said to him, "Go and marry a prostitute,[^b] so that some of her children will be conceived in prostitution. This will illustrate how Israel has acted like a prostitute by turning against the LORD and worshiping other gods." 



###### 3 

So Hosea married Gomer, the daughter of Diblaim, and she became pregnant and gave Hosea a son. 



###### 4 

And the LORD said, "Name the child Jezreel, for I am about to punish King Jehu's dynasty to avenge the murders he committed at Jezreel. In fact, I will bring an end to Israel's independence. 



###### 5 

I will break its military power in the Jezreel Valley." 



###### 6 

Soon Gomer became pregnant again and gave birth to a daughter. And the LORD said to Hosea, "Name your daughter Lo-ruhamah--'Not loved'--for I will no longer show love to the people of Israel or forgive them. 



###### 7 

But I will show love to the people of Judah. I will free them from their enemies--not with weapons and armies or horses and charioteers, but by my power as the LORD their God." 



###### 8 

After Gomer had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she again became pregnant and gave birth to a second son. 



###### 9 

And the LORD said, "Name him Lo-ammi--'Not my people'--for Israel is not my people, and I am not their God. 



###### 10 

[^c]"Yet the time will come when Israel's people will be like the sands of the seashore--too many to count! Then, at the place where they were told, 'You are not my people,' it will be said, 'You are children of the living God.' 



###### 11 

Then the people of Judah and Israel will unite together. They will choose one leader for themselves, and they will return from exile together. What a day that will be--the day of Jezreel[^d]--when God will again plant his people in his land. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

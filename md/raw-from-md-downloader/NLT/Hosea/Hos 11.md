# Hosea 11

***




###### 1 

"When Israel was a child, I loved him, and I called my son out of Egypt. 



###### 2 

But the more I called to him, the farther he moved from me,[^a] offering sacrifices to the images of Baal and burning incense to idols. 



###### 3 

I myself taught Israel[^b] how to walk, leading him along by the hand. But he doesn't know or even care that it was I who took care of him. 



###### 4 

I led Israel along with my ropes of kindness and love. I lifted the yoke from his neck, and I myself stooped to feed him. 



###### 5 

"But since my people refuse to return to me, they will return to Egypt and will be forced to serve Assyria. 



###### 6 

War will swirl through their cities; their enemies will crash through their gates. They will destroy them, trapping them in their own evil plans. 



###### 7 

For my people are determined to desert me. They call me the Most High, but they don't truly honor me. 



###### 8 

"Oh, how can I give you up, Israel? How can I let you go? How can I destroy you like Admah or demolish you like Zeboiim? My heart is torn within me, and my compassion overflows. 



###### 9 

No, I will not unleash my fierce anger. I will not completely destroy Israel, for I am God and not a mere mortal. I am the Holy One living among you, and I will not come to destroy. 



###### 10 

For someday the people will follow me. I, the LORD, will roar like a lion. And when I roar, my people will return trembling from the west. 



###### 11 

Like a flock of birds, they will come from Egypt. Trembling like doves, they will return from Assyria. And I will bring them home again," says the LORD. ## Charges against Israel and Judah 



###### 12 

[^c]Israel surrounds me with lies and deceit, but Judah still obeys God and is faithful to the Holy One.[^d] ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

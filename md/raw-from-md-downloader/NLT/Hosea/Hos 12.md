# Hosea 12

***




###### 1 

[^a]The people of Israel[^b] feed on the wind; they chase after the east wind all day long. They pile up lies and violence; they are making an alliance with Assyria while sending olive oil to buy support from Egypt. 



###### 2 

Now the LORD is bringing charges against Judah. He is about to punish Jacob[^c] for all his deceitful ways, and pay him back for all he has done. 



###### 3 

Even in the womb, Jacob struggled with his brother; when he became a man, he even fought with God. 



###### 4 

Yes, he wrestled with the angel and won. He wept and pleaded for a blessing from him. There at Bethel he met God face to face, and God spoke to him[^d]-- 



###### 5 

the LORD God of Heaven's Armies, the LORD is his name! 



###### 6 

So now, come back to your God. Act with love and justice, and always depend on him. 



###### 7 

But no, the people are like crafty merchants selling from dishonest scales-- they love to cheat. 



###### 8 

Israel boasts, "I am rich! I've made a fortune all by myself! No one has caught me cheating! My record is spotless!" 



###### 9 

"But I am the LORD your God, who rescued you from slavery in Egypt. And I will make you live in tents again, as you do each year at the Festival of Shelters.[^e] 



###### 10 

I sent my prophets to warn you with many visions and parables." 



###### 11 

But the people of Gilead are worthless because of their idol worship. And in Gilgal, too, they sacrifice bulls; their altars are lined up like the heaps of stone along the edges of a plowed field. 



###### 12 

Jacob fled to the land of Aram, and there he[^f] earned a wife by tending sheep. 



###### 13 

Then by a prophet the LORD brought Jacob's descendants[^g] out of Egypt; and by that prophet they were protected. 



###### 14 

But the people of Israel have bitterly provoked the LORD, so their Lord will now sentence them to death in payment for their sins. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Isaiah 4

***




###### 1 

In that day so few men will be left that seven women will fight for each man, saying, "Let us all marry you! We will provide our own food and clothing. Only let us take your name so we won't be mocked as old maids." ## A Promise of Restoration 



###### 2 

But in that day, the branch[^a] of the LORD will be beautiful and glorious; the fruit of the land will be the pride and glory of all who survive in Israel. 



###### 3 

All who remain in Zion will be a holy people-- those who survive the destruction of Jerusalem and are recorded among the living. 



###### 4 

The Lord will wash the filth from beautiful Zion[^b] and cleanse Jerusalem of its bloodstains with the hot breath of fiery judgment. 



###### 5 

Then the LORD will provide shade for Mount Zion and all who assemble there. He will provide a canopy of cloud during the day and smoke and flaming fire at night, covering the glorious land. 



###### 6 

It will be a shelter from daytime heat and a hiding place from storms and rain. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

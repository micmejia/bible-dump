# Isaiah 62

***




###### 1 

Because I love Zion, I will not keep still. Because my heart yearns for Jerusalem, I cannot remain silent. I will not stop praying for her until her righteousness shines like the dawn, and her salvation blazes like a burning torch. 



###### 2 

The nations will see your righteousness. World leaders will be blinded by your glory. And you will be given a new name by the LORD's own mouth. 



###### 3 

The LORD will hold you in his hand for all to see-- a splendid crown in the hand of God. 



###### 4 

Never again will you be called "The Forsaken City"[^a] or "The Desolate Land."[^b] Your new name will be "The City of God's Delight"[^c] and "The Bride of God,"[^d] for the LORD delights in you and will claim you as his bride. 



###### 5 

Your children will commit themselves to you, O Jerusalem, just as a young man commits himself to his bride. Then God will rejoice over you as a bridegroom rejoices over his bride. 



###### 6 

O Jerusalem, I have posted watchmen on your walls; they will pray day and night, continually. Take no rest, all you who pray to the LORD. 



###### 7 

Give the LORD no rest until he completes his work, until he makes Jerusalem the pride of the earth. 



###### 8 

The LORD has sworn to Jerusalem by his own strength: "I will never again hand you over to your enemies. Never again will foreign warriors come and take away your grain and new wine. 



###### 9 

You raised the grain, and you will eat it, praising the LORD. Within the courtyards of the Temple, you yourselves will drink the wine you have pressed." 



###### 10 

Go out through the gates! Prepare the highway for my people to return! Smooth out the road; pull out the boulders; raise a flag for all the nations to see. 



###### 11 

The LORD has sent this message to every land: "Tell the people of Israel,[^e] 'Look, your Savior is coming. See, he brings his reward with him as he comes.'" 



###### 12 

They will be called "The Holy People" and "The People Redeemed by the LORD." And Jerusalem will be known as "The Desirable Place" and "The City No Longer Forsaken." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

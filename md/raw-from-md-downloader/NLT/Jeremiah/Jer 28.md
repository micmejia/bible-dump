# Jeremiah 28

***




###### 1 

One day in late summer[^a] of that same year--the fourth year of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah--Hananiah son of Azzur, a prophet from Gibeon, addressed me publicly in the Temple while all the priests and people listened. He said, 



###### 2 

"This is what the LORD of Heaven's Armies, the God of Israel, says: 'I will remove the yoke of the king of Babylon from your necks. 



###### 3 

Within two years I will bring back all the Temple treasures that King Nebuchadnezzar carried off to Babylon. 



###### 4 

And I will bring back Jehoiachin[^b] son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and all the other captives that were taken to Babylon. I will surely break the yoke that the king of Babylon has put on your necks. I, the LORD, have spoken!'" 



###### 5 

Jeremiah responded to Hananiah as they stood in front of all the priests and people at the Temple. 



###### 6 

He said, "Amen! May your prophecies come true! I hope the LORD does everything you say. I hope he does bring back from Babylon the treasures of this Temple and all the captives. 



###### 7 

But listen now to the solemn words I speak to you in the presence of all these people. 



###### 8 

The ancient prophets who preceded you and me spoke against many nations, always warning of war, disaster, and disease. 



###### 9 

So a prophet who predicts peace must show he is right. Only when his predictions come true can we know that he is really from the LORD." 



###### 10 

Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke off Jeremiah's neck and broke it in pieces. 



###### 11 

And Hananiah said again to the crowd that had gathered, "This is what the LORD says: 'Just as this yoke has been broken, within two years I will break the yoke of oppression from all the nations now subject to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon.'" With that, Jeremiah left the Temple area. 



###### 12 

Soon after this confrontation with Hananiah, the LORD gave this message to Jeremiah: 



###### 13 

"Go and tell Hananiah, 'This is what the LORD says: You have broken a wooden yoke, but you have replaced it with a yoke of iron. 



###### 14 

The LORD of Heaven's Armies, the God of Israel, says: I have put a yoke of iron on the necks of all these nations, forcing them into slavery under King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. I have put everything, even the wild animals, under his control.'" 



###### 15 

Then Jeremiah the prophet said to Hananiah, "Listen, Hananiah! The LORD has not sent you, but the people believe your lies. 



###### 16 

Therefore, this is what the LORD says: 'You must die. Your life will end this very year because you have rebelled against the LORD.'" 



###### 17 

Two months later[^c] the prophet Hananiah died. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

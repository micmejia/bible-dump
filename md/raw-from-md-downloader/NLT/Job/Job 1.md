# Job 1

***




###### 1 

There once was a man named Job who lived in the land of Uz. He was blameless--a man of complete integrity. He feared God and stayed away from evil. 



###### 2 

He had seven sons and three daughters. 



###### 3 

He owned 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 teams of oxen, and 500 female donkeys. He also had many servants. He was, in fact, the richest person in that entire area. 



###### 4 

Job's sons would take turns preparing feasts in their homes, and they would also invite their three sisters to celebrate with them. 



###### 5 

When these celebrations ended--sometimes after several days--Job would purify his children. He would get up early in the morning and offer a burnt offering for each of them. For Job said to himself, "Perhaps my children have sinned and have cursed God in their hearts." This was Job's regular practice. ## Job's First Test 



###### 6 

One day the members of the heavenly court[^a] came to present themselves before the LORD, and the Accuser, Satan,[^b] came with them. 



###### 7 

"Where have you come from?" the LORD asked Satan. Satan answered the LORD, "I have been patrolling the earth, watching everything that's going on." 



###### 8 

Then the LORD asked Satan, "Have you noticed my servant Job? He is the finest man in all the earth. He is blameless--a man of complete integrity. He fears God and stays away from evil." 



###### 9 

Satan replied to the LORD, "Yes, but Job has good reason to fear God. 



###### 10 

You have always put a wall of protection around him and his home and his property. You have made him prosper in everything he does. Look how rich he is! 



###### 11 

But reach out and take away everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face!" 



###### 12 

"All right, you may test him," the LORD said to Satan. "Do whatever you want with everything he possesses, but don't harm him physically." So Satan left the LORD's presence. 



###### 13 

One day when Job's sons and daughters were feasting at the oldest brother's house, 



###### 14 

a messenger arrived at Job's home with this news: "Your oxen were plowing, with the donkeys feeding beside them, 



###### 15 

when the Sabeans raided us. They stole all the animals and killed all the farmhands. I am the only one who escaped to tell you." 



###### 16 

While he was still speaking, another messenger arrived with this news: "The fire of God has fallen from heaven and burned up your sheep and all the shepherds. I am the only one who escaped to tell you." 



###### 17 

While he was still speaking, a third messenger arrived with this news: "Three bands of Chaldean raiders have stolen your camels and killed your servants. I am the only one who escaped to tell you." 



###### 18 

While he was still speaking, another messenger arrived with this news: "Your sons and daughters were feasting in their oldest brother's home. 



###### 19 

Suddenly, a powerful wind swept in from the wilderness and hit the house on all sides. The house collapsed, and all your children are dead. I am the only one who escaped to tell you." 



###### 20 

Job stood up and tore his robe in grief. Then he shaved his head and fell to the ground to worship. 



###### 21 

He said, "I came naked from my mother's womb, and I will be naked when I leave. The LORD gave me what I had, and the LORD has taken it away. Praise the name of the LORD!" 



###### 22 

In all of this, Job did not sin by blaming God. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

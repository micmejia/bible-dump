# Job 25

***




###### 1 

Then Bildad the Shuhite replied: 



###### 2 

"God is powerful and dreadful. He enforces peace in the heavens. 



###### 3 

Who is able to count his heavenly army? Doesn't his light shine on all the earth? 



###### 4 

How can a mortal be innocent before God? Can anyone born of a woman be pure? 



###### 5 

God is more glorious than the moon; he shines brighter than the stars. 



###### 6 

In comparison, people are maggots; we mortals are mere worms." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

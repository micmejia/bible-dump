# Job 26

***




###### 1 

Then Job spoke again: 



###### 2 

"How you have helped the powerless! How you have saved the weak! 



###### 3 

How you have enlightened my stupidity! What wise advice you have offered! 



###### 4 

Where have you gotten all these wise sayings? Whose spirit speaks through you? 



###### 5 

"The dead tremble-- those who live beneath the waters. 



###### 6 

The underworld[^a] is naked in God's presence. The place of destruction[^b] is uncovered. 



###### 7 

God stretches the northern sky over empty space and hangs the earth on nothing. 



###### 8 

He wraps the rain in his thick clouds, and the clouds don't burst with the weight. 



###### 9 

He covers the face of the moon,[^c] shrouding it with his clouds. 



###### 10 

He created the horizon when he separated the waters; he set the boundary between day and night. 



###### 11 

The foundations of heaven tremble; they shudder at his rebuke. 



###### 12 

By his power the sea grew calm. By his skill he crushed the great sea monster.[^d] 



###### 13 

His Spirit made the heavens beautiful, and his power pierced the gliding serpent. 



###### 14 

These are just the beginning of all that he does, merely a whisper of his power. Who, then, can comprehend the thunder of his power?" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

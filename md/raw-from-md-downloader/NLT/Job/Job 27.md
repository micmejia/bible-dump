# Job 27

***




###### 1 

Job continued speaking: 



###### 2 

"I vow by the living God, who has taken away my rights, by the Almighty who has embittered my soul-- 



###### 3 

As long as I live, while I have breath from God, 



###### 4 

my lips will speak no evil, and my tongue will speak no lies. 



###### 5 

I will never concede that you are right; I will defend my integrity until I die. 



###### 6 

I will maintain my innocence without wavering. My conscience is clear for as long as I live. 



###### 7 

"May my enemy be punished like the wicked, my adversary like those who do evil. 



###### 8 

For what hope do the godless have when God cuts them off and takes away their life? 



###### 9 

Will God listen to their cry when trouble comes upon them? 



###### 10 

Can they take delight in the Almighty? Can they call to God at any time? 



###### 11 

I will teach you about God's power. I will not conceal anything concerning the Almighty. 



###### 12 

But you have seen all this, yet you say all these useless things to me. 



###### 13 

"This is what the wicked will receive from God; this is their inheritance from the Almighty. 



###### 14 

They may have many children, but the children will die in war or starve to death. 



###### 15 

Those who survive will die of a plague, and not even their widows will mourn them. 



###### 16 

"Evil people may have piles of money and may store away mounds of clothing. 



###### 17 

But the righteous will wear that clothing, and the innocent will divide that money. 



###### 18 

The wicked build houses as fragile as a spider's web,[^a] as flimsy as a shelter made of branches. 



###### 19 

The wicked go to bed rich but wake to find that all their wealth is gone. 



###### 20 

Terror overwhelms them like a flood, and they are blown away in the storms of the night. 



###### 21 

The east wind carries them away, and they are gone. It sweeps them away. 



###### 22 

It whirls down on them without mercy. They struggle to flee from its power. 



###### 23 

But everyone jeers at them and mocks them. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

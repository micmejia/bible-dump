# Job 3

***




###### 1 

At last Job spoke, and he cursed the day of his birth. 



###### 2 

He said: 



###### 3 

"Let the day of my birth be erased, and the night I was conceived. 



###### 4 

Let that day be turned to darkness. Let it be lost even to God on high, and let no light shine on it. 



###### 5 

Let the darkness and utter gloom claim that day for its own. Let a black cloud overshadow it, and let the darkness terrify it. 



###### 6 

Let that night be blotted off the calendar, never again to be counted among the days of the year, never again to appear among the months. 



###### 7 

Let that night be childless. Let it have no joy. 



###### 8 

Let those who are experts at cursing-- whose cursing could rouse Leviathan[^a]-- curse that day. 



###### 9 

Let its morning stars remain dark. Let it hope for light, but in vain; may it never see the morning light. 



###### 10 

Curse that day for failing to shut my mother's womb, for letting me be born to see all this trouble. 



###### 11 

"Why wasn't I born dead? Why didn't I die as I came from the womb? 



###### 12 

Why was I laid on my mother's lap? Why did she nurse me at her breasts? 



###### 13 

Had I died at birth, I would now be at peace. I would be asleep and at rest. 



###### 14 

I would rest with the world's kings and prime ministers, whose great buildings now lie in ruins. 



###### 15 

I would rest with princes, rich in gold, whose palaces were filled with silver. 



###### 16 

Why wasn't I buried like a stillborn child, like a baby who never lives to see the light? 



###### 17 

For in death the wicked cause no trouble, and the weary are at rest. 



###### 18 

Even captives are at ease in death, with no guards to curse them. 



###### 19 

Rich and poor are both there, and the slave is free from his master. 



###### 20 

"Oh, why give light to those in misery, and life to those who are bitter? 



###### 21 

They long for death, and it won't come. They search for death more eagerly than for hidden treasure. 



###### 22 

They're filled with joy when they finally die, and rejoice when they find the grave. 



###### 23 

Why is life given to those with no future, those God has surrounded with difficulties? 



###### 24 

I cannot eat for sighing; my groans pour out like water. 



###### 25 

What I always feared has happened to me. What I dreaded has come true. 



###### 26 

I have no peace, no quietness. I have no rest; only trouble comes." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

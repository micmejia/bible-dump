# Job 35

***




###### 1 

Then Elihu said: 



###### 2 

"Do you think it is right for you to claim, 'I am righteous before God'? 



###### 3 

For you also ask, 'What's in it for me? What's the use of living a righteous life?' 



###### 4 

"I will answer you and all your friends, too. 



###### 5 

Look up into the sky, and see the clouds high above you. 



###### 6 

If you sin, how does that affect God? Even if you sin again and again, what effect will it have on him? 



###### 7 

If you are good, is this some great gift to him? What could you possibly give him? 



###### 8 

No, your sins affect only people like yourself, and your good deeds also affect only humans. 



###### 9 

"People cry out when they are oppressed. They groan beneath the power of the mighty. 



###### 10 

Yet they don't ask, 'Where is God my Creator, the one who gives songs in the night? 



###### 11 

Where is the one who makes us smarter than the animals and wiser than the birds of the sky?' 



###### 12 

And when they cry out, God does not answer because of their pride. 



###### 13 

But it is wrong to say God doesn't listen, to say the Almighty isn't concerned. 



###### 14 

You say you can't see him, but he will bring justice if you will only wait.[^a] 



###### 15 

You say he does not respond to sinners with anger and is not greatly concerned about wickedness.[^b] 



###### 16 

But you are talking nonsense, Job. You have spoken like a fool." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

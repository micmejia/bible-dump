# Job 8

***




###### 1 

Then Bildad the Shuhite replied to Job: 



###### 2 

"How long will you go on like this? You sound like a blustering wind. 



###### 3 

Does God twist justice? Does the Almighty twist what is right? 



###### 4 

Your children must have sinned against him, so their punishment was well deserved. 



###### 5 

But if you pray to God and seek the favor of the Almighty, 



###### 6 

and if you are pure and live with integrity, he will surely rise up and restore your happy home. 



###### 7 

And though you started with little, you will end with much. 



###### 8 

"Just ask the previous generation. Pay attention to the experience of our ancestors. 



###### 9 

For we were born but yesterday and know nothing. Our days on earth are as fleeting as a shadow. 



###### 10 

But those who came before us will teach you. They will teach you the wisdom of old. 



###### 11 

"Can papyrus reeds grow tall without a marsh? Can marsh grass flourish without water? 



###### 12 

While they are still flowering, not ready to be cut, they begin to wither more quickly than grass. 



###### 13 

The same happens to all who forget God. The hopes of the godless evaporate. 



###### 14 

Their confidence hangs by a thread. They are leaning on a spider's web. 



###### 15 

They cling to their home for security, but it won't last. They try to hold it tight, but it will not endure. 



###### 16 

The godless seem like a lush plant growing in the sunshine, its branches spreading across the garden. 



###### 17 

Its roots grow down through a pile of stones; it takes hold on a bed of rocks. 



###### 18 

But when it is uprooted, it's as though it never existed! 



###### 19 

That's the end of its life, and others spring up from the earth to replace it. 



###### 20 

"But look, God will not reject a person of integrity, nor will he lend a hand to the wicked. 



###### 21 

He will once again fill your mouth with laughter and your lips with shouts of joy. 



###### 22 

Those who hate you will be clothed with shame, and the home of the wicked will be destroyed." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Joel 3

***




###### 1 

[^a]"At the time of those events," says the LORD, "when I restore the prosperity of Judah and Jerusalem, 



###### 2 

I will gather the armies of the world into the valley of Jehoshaphat.[^b] There I will judge them for harming my people, my special possession, for scattering my people among the nations, and for dividing up my land. 



###### 3 

They threw dice[^c] to decide which of my people would be their slaves. They traded boys to obtain prostitutes and sold girls for enough wine to get drunk. 



###### 4 

"What do you have against me, Tyre and Sidon and you cities of Philistia? Are you trying to take revenge on me? If you are, then watch out! I will strike swiftly and pay you back for everything you have done. 



###### 5 

You have taken my silver and gold and all my precious treasures, and have carried them off to your pagan temples. 



###### 6 

You have sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks,[^d] so they could take them far from their homeland. 



###### 7 

"But I will bring them back from all the places to which you sold them, and I will pay you back for everything you have done. 



###### 8 

I will sell your sons and daughters to the people of Judah, and they will sell them to the people of Arabia,[^e] a nation far away. I, the LORD, have spoken!" 



###### 9 

Say to the nations far and wide: "Get ready for war! Call out your best warriors. Let all your fighting men advance for the attack. 



###### 10 

Hammer your plowshares into swords and your pruning hooks into spears. Train even your weaklings to be warriors. 



###### 11 

Come quickly, all you nations everywhere. Gather together in the valley." And now, O LORD, call out your warriors! 



###### 12 

"Let the nations be called to arms. Let them march to the valley of Jehoshaphat. There I, the LORD, will sit to pronounce judgment on them all. 



###### 13 

Swing the sickle, for the harvest is ripe.[^f] Come, tread the grapes, for the winepress is full. The storage vats are overflowing with the wickedness of these people." 



###### 14 

Thousands upon thousands are waiting in the valley of decision. There the day of the LORD will soon arrive. 



###### 15 

The sun and moon will grow dark, and the stars will no longer shine. 



###### 16 

The LORD's voice will roar from Zion and thunder from Jerusalem, and the heavens and the earth will shake. But the LORD will be a refuge for his people, a strong fortress for the people of Israel. ## Blessings for God's People 



###### 17 

"Then you will know that I, the LORD your God, live in Zion, my holy mountain. Jerusalem will be holy forever, and foreign armies will never conquer her again. 



###### 18 

In that day the mountains will drip with sweet wine, and the hills will flow with milk. Water will fill the streambeds of Judah, and a fountain will burst forth from the LORD's Temple, watering the arid valley of acacias.[^g] 



###### 19 

But Egypt will become a wasteland and Edom will become a wilderness, because they attacked the people of Judah and killed innocent people in their land. 



###### 20 

"But Judah will be filled with people forever, and Jerusalem will endure through all generations. 



###### 21 

I will pardon my people's crimes, which I have not yet pardoned; and I, the LORD, will make my home in Jerusalem[^h] with my people." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

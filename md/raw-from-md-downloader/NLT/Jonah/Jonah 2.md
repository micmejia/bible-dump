# Jonah 2

***




###### 1 

[^a]Then Jonah prayed to the LORD his God from inside the fish. 



###### 2 

He said, "I cried out to the LORD in my great trouble, and he answered me. I called to you from the land of the dead,[^b] and LORD, you heard me! 



###### 3 

You threw me into the ocean depths, and I sank down to the heart of the sea. The mighty waters engulfed me; I was buried beneath your wild and stormy waves. 



###### 4 

Then I said, 'O LORD, you have driven me from your presence. Yet I will look once more toward your holy Temple.' 



###### 5 

"I sank beneath the waves, and the waters closed over me. Seaweed wrapped itself around my head. 



###### 6 

I sank down to the very roots of the mountains. I was imprisoned in the earth, whose gates lock shut forever. But you, O LORD my God, snatched me from the jaws of death! 



###### 7 

As my life was slipping away, I remembered the LORD. And my earnest prayer went out to you in your holy Temple. 



###### 8 

Those who worship false gods turn their backs on all God's mercies. 



###### 9 

But I will offer sacrifices to you with songs of praise, and I will fulfill all my vows. For my salvation comes from the LORD alone." 



###### 10 

Then the LORD ordered the fish to spit Jonah out onto the beach. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Jonah 3

***




###### 1 

Then the LORD spoke to Jonah a second time: 



###### 2 

"Get up and go to the great city of Nineveh, and deliver the message I have given you." 



###### 3 

This time Jonah obeyed the LORD's command and went to Nineveh, a city so large that it took three days to see it all.[^a] 



###### 4 

On the day Jonah entered the city, he shouted to the crowds: "Forty days from now Nineveh will be destroyed!" 



###### 5 

The people of Nineveh believed God's message, and from the greatest to the least, they declared a fast and put on burlap to show their sorrow. 



###### 6 

When the king of Nineveh heard what Jonah was saying, he stepped down from his throne and took off his royal robes. He dressed himself in burlap and sat on a heap of ashes. 



###### 7 

Then the king and his nobles sent this decree throughout the city: "No one, not even the animals from your herds and flocks, may eat or drink anything at all. 



###### 8 

People and animals alike must wear garments of mourning, and everyone must pray earnestly to God. They must turn from their evil ways and stop all their violence. 



###### 9 

Who can tell? Perhaps even yet God will change his mind and hold back his fierce anger from destroying us." 



###### 10 

When God saw what they had done and how they had put a stop to their evil ways, he changed his mind and did not carry out the destruction he had threatened. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

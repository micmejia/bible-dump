# Jonah 4

***




###### 1 

This change of plans greatly upset Jonah, and he became very angry. 



###### 2 

So he complained to the LORD about it: "Didn't I say before I left home that you would do this, LORD? That is why I ran away to Tarshish! I knew that you are a merciful and compassionate God, slow to get angry and filled with unfailing love. You are eager to turn back from destroying people. 



###### 3 

Just kill me now, LORD! I'd rather be dead than alive if what I predicted will not happen." 



###### 4 

The LORD replied, "Is it right for you to be angry about this?" 



###### 5 

Then Jonah went out to the east side of the city and made a shelter to sit under as he waited to see what would happen to the city. 



###### 6 

And the LORD God arranged for a leafy plant to grow there, and soon it spread its broad leaves over Jonah's head, shading him from the sun. This eased his discomfort, and Jonah was very grateful for the plant. 



###### 7 

But God also arranged for a worm! The next morning at dawn the worm ate through the stem of the plant so that it withered away. 



###### 8 

And as the sun grew hot, God arranged for a scorching east wind to blow on Jonah. The sun beat down on his head until he grew faint and wished to die. "Death is certainly better than living like this!" he exclaimed. 



###### 9 

Then God said to Jonah, "Is it right for you to be angry because the plant died?" "Yes," Jonah retorted, "even angry enough to die!" 



###### 10 

Then the LORD said, "You feel sorry about the plant, though you did nothing to put it there. It came quickly and died quickly. 



###### 11 

But Nineveh has more than 120,000 people living in spiritual darkness,[^a] not to mention all the animals. Shouldn't I feel sorry for such a great city?" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Lamentations 5

***




###### 1 

LORD, remember what has happened to us. See how we have been disgraced! 



###### 2 

Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, our homes to foreigners. 



###### 3 

We are orphaned and fatherless. Our mothers are widowed. 



###### 4 

We have to pay for water to drink, and even firewood is expensive. 



###### 5 

Those who pursue us are at our heels; we are exhausted but are given no rest. 



###### 6 

We submitted to Egypt and Assyria to get enough food to survive. 



###### 7 

Our ancestors sinned, but they have died-- and we are suffering the punishment they deserved! 



###### 8 

Slaves have now become our masters; there is no one left to rescue us. 



###### 9 

We hunt for food at the risk of our lives, for violence rules the countryside. 



###### 10 

The famine has blackened our skin as though baked in an oven. 



###### 11 

Our enemies rape the women in Jerusalem[^a] and the young girls in all the towns of Judah. 



###### 12 

Our princes are being hanged by their thumbs, and our elders are treated with contempt. 



###### 13 

Young men are led away to work at millstones, and boys stagger under heavy loads of wood. 



###### 14 

The elders no longer sit in the city gates; the young men no longer dance and sing. 



###### 15 

Joy has left our hearts; our dancing has turned to mourning. 



###### 16 

The garlands have[^b] fallen from our heads. Weep for us because we have sinned. 



###### 17 

Our hearts are sick and weary, and our eyes grow dim with tears. 



###### 18 

For Jerusalem[^c] is empty and desolate, a place haunted by jackals. 



###### 19 

But LORD, you remain the same forever! Your throne continues from generation to generation. 



###### 20 

Why do you continue to forget us? Why have you abandoned us for so long? 



###### 21 

Restore us, O LORD, and bring us back to you again! Give us back the joys we once had! 



###### 22 

Or have you utterly rejected us? Are you angry with us still? ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

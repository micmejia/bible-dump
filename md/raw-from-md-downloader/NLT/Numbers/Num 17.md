# Numbers 17

***




###### 1 

[^a]Then the LORD said to Moses, 



###### 2 

"Tell the people of Israel to bring you twelve wooden staffs, one from each leader of Israel's ancestral tribes, and inscribe each leader's name on his staff. 



###### 3 

Inscribe Aaron's name on the staff of the tribe of Levi, for there must be one staff for the leader of each ancestral tribe. 



###### 4 

Place these staffs in the Tabernacle in front of the Ark containing the tablets of the Covenant,[^b] where I meet with you. 



###### 5 

Buds will sprout on the staff belonging to the man I choose. Then I will finally put an end to the people's murmuring and complaining against you." 



###### 6 

So Moses gave the instructions to the people of Israel, and each of the twelve tribal leaders, including Aaron, brought Moses a staff. 



###### 7 

Moses placed the staffs in the LORD's presence in the Tabernacle of the Covenant.[^c] 



###### 8 

When he went into the Tabernacle of the Covenant the next day, he found that Aaron's staff, representing the tribe of Levi, had sprouted, budded, blossomed, and produced ripe almonds! 



###### 9 

When Moses brought all the staffs out from the LORD's presence, he showed them to the people. Each man claimed his own staff. 



###### 10 

And the LORD said to Moses: "Place Aaron's staff permanently before the Ark of the Covenant[^d] to serve as a warning to rebels. This should put an end to their complaints against me and prevent any further deaths." 



###### 11 

So Moses did as the LORD commanded him. 



###### 12 

Then the people of Israel said to Moses, "Look, we are doomed! We are dead! We are ruined! 



###### 13 

Everyone who even comes close to the Tabernacle of the LORD dies. Are we all doomed to die?" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Numbers 24

***




###### 1 

By now Balaam realized that the LORD was determined to bless Israel, so he did not resort to divination as before. Instead, he turned and looked out toward the wilderness, 



###### 2 

where he saw the people of Israel camped, tribe by tribe. Then the Spirit of God came upon him, 



###### 3 

and this is the message he delivered: "This is the message of Balaam son of Beor, the message of the man whose eyes see clearly, 



###### 4 

the message of one who hears the words of God, who sees a vision from the Almighty, who bows down with eyes wide open: 



###### 5 

How beautiful are your tents, O Jacob; how lovely are your homes, O Israel! 



###### 6 

They spread before me like palm groves,[^a] like gardens by the riverside. They are like tall trees planted by the LORD, like cedars beside the waters. 



###### 7 

Water will flow from their buckets; their offspring have all they need. Their king will be greater than Agag; their kingdom will be exalted. 



###### 8 

God brought them out of Egypt; for them he is as strong as a wild ox. He devours all the nations that oppose him, breaking their bones in pieces, shooting them with arrows. 



###### 9 

Like a lion, Israel crouches and lies down; like a lioness, who dares to arouse her? Blessed is everyone who blesses you, O Israel, and cursed is everyone who curses you." 



###### 10 

King Balak flew into a rage against Balaam. He angrily clapped his hands and shouted, "I called you to curse my enemies! Instead, you have blessed them three times. 



###### 11 

Now get out of here! Go back home! I promised to reward you richly, but the LORD has kept you from your reward." 



###### 12 

Balaam told Balak, "Don't you remember what I told your messengers? I said, 



###### 13 

'Even if Balak were to give me his palace filled with silver and gold, I would be powerless to do anything against the will of the LORD.' I told you that I could say only what the LORD says! 



###### 14 

Now I am returning to my own people. But first let me tell you what the Israelites will do to your people in the future." ## Balaam's Final Messages 



###### 15 

This is the message Balaam delivered: "This is the message of Balaam son of Beor, the message of the man whose eyes see clearly, 



###### 16 

the message of one who hears the words of God, who has knowledge from the Most High, who sees a vision from the Almighty, who bows down with eyes wide open: 



###### 17 

I see him, but not here and now. I perceive him, but far in the distant future. A star will rise from Jacob; a scepter will emerge from Israel. It will crush the heads of Moab's people, cracking the skulls[^b] of the people of Sheth. 



###### 18 

Edom will be taken over, and Seir, its enemy, will be conquered, while Israel marches on in triumph. 



###### 19 

A ruler will rise in Jacob who will destroy the survivors of Ir." 



###### 20 

Then Balaam looked over toward the people of Amalek and delivered this message: "Amalek was the greatest of nations, but its destiny is destruction!" 



###### 21 

Then he looked over toward the Kenites and delivered this message: "Your home is secure; your nest is set in the rocks. 



###### 22 

But the Kenites will be destroyed when Assyria[^c] takes you captive." 



###### 23 

Balaam concluded his messages by saying: "Alas, who can survive unless God has willed it? 



###### 24 

Ships will come from the coasts of Cyprus[^d]; they will oppress Assyria and afflict Eber, but they, too, will be utterly destroyed." 



###### 25 

Then Balaam left and returned home, and Balak also went on his way. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

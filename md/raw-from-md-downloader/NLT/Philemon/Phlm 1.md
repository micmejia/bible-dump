# Philemon 1

***




###### 1 

This letter is from Paul, a prisoner for preaching the Good News about Christ Jesus, and from our brother Timothy. I am writing to Philemon, our beloved co-worker, 



###### 2 

and to our sister Apphia, and to our fellow soldier Archippus, and to the church that meets in your[^a] house. 



###### 3 

May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace. ## Paul's Thanksgiving and Prayer 



###### 4 

I always thank my God when I pray for you, Philemon, 



###### 5 

because I keep hearing about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all of God's people. 



###### 6 

And I am praying that you will put into action the generosity that comes from your faith as you understand and experience all the good things we have in Christ. 



###### 7 

Your love has given me much joy and comfort, my brother, for your kindness has often refreshed the hearts of God's people. ## Paul's Appeal for Onesimus 



###### 8 

That is why I am boldly asking a favor of you. I could demand it in the name of Christ because it is the right thing for you to do. 



###### 9 

But because of our love, I prefer simply to ask you. Consider this as a request from me--Paul, an old man and now also a prisoner for the sake of Christ Jesus.[^b] 



###### 10 

I appeal to you to show kindness to my child, Onesimus. I became his father in the faith while here in prison. 



###### 11 

Onesimus[^c] hasn't been of much use to you in the past, but now he is very useful to both of us. 



###### 12 

I am sending him back to you, and with him comes my own heart. 



###### 13 

I wanted to keep him here with me while I am in these chains for preaching the Good News, and he would have helped me on your behalf. 



###### 14 

But I didn't want to do anything without your consent. I wanted you to help because you were willing, not because you were forced. 



###### 15 

It seems you lost Onesimus for a little while so that you could have him back forever. 



###### 16 

He is no longer like a slave to you. He is more than a slave, for he is a beloved brother, especially to me. Now he will mean much more to you, both as a man and as a brother in the Lord. 



###### 17 

So if you consider me your partner, welcome him as you would welcome me. 



###### 18 

If he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything, charge it to me. 



###### 19 

I, PAUL, WRITE THIS WITH MY OWN HAND: I WILL REPAY IT. AND I WON'T MENTION THAT YOU OWE ME YOUR VERY SOUL! 



###### 20 

Yes, my brother, please do me this favor[^d] for the Lord's sake. Give me this encouragement in Christ. 



###### 21 

I am confident as I write this letter that you will do what I ask and even more! 



###### 22 

One more thing--please prepare a guest room for me, for I am hoping that God will answer your prayers and let me return to you soon. ## Paul's Final Greetings 



###### 23 

Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you his greetings. 



###### 24 

So do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my co-workers. 



###### 25 

May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

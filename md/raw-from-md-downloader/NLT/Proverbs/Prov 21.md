# Proverbs 21

***




###### 1 

The king's heart is like a stream of water directed by the LORD; he guides it wherever he pleases. 



###### 2 

People may be right in their own eyes, but the LORD examines their heart. 



###### 3 

The LORD is more pleased when we do what is right and just than when we offer him sacrifices. 



###### 4 

Haughty eyes, a proud heart, and evil actions are all sin. 



###### 5 

Good planning and hard work lead to prosperity, but hasty shortcuts lead to poverty. 



###### 6 

Wealth created by a lying tongue is a vanishing mist and a deadly trap.[^a] 



###### 7 

The violence of the wicked sweeps them away, because they refuse to do what is just. 



###### 8 

The guilty walk a crooked path; the innocent travel a straight road. 



###### 9 

It's better to live alone in the corner of an attic than with a quarrelsome wife in a lovely home. 



###### 10 

Evil people desire evil; their neighbors get no mercy from them. 



###### 11 

If you punish a mocker, the simpleminded become wise; if you instruct the wise, they will be all the wiser. 



###### 12 

The Righteous One[^b] knows what is going on in the homes of the wicked; he will bring disaster on them. 



###### 13 

Those who shut their ears to the cries of the poor will be ignored in their own time of need. 



###### 14 

A secret gift calms anger; a bribe under the table pacifies fury. 



###### 15 

Justice is a joy to the godly, but it terrifies evildoers. 



###### 16 

The person who strays from common sense will end up in the company of the dead. 



###### 17 

Those who love pleasure become poor; those who love wine and luxury will never be rich. 



###### 18 

The wicked are punished in place of the godly, and traitors in place of the honest. 



###### 19 

It's better to live alone in the desert than with a quarrelsome, complaining wife. 



###### 20 

The wise have wealth and luxury, but fools spend whatever they get. 



###### 21 

Whoever pursues righteousness and unfailing love will find life, righteousness, and honor. 



###### 22 

The wise conquer the city of the strong and level the fortress in which they trust. 



###### 23 

Watch your tongue and keep your mouth shut, and you will stay out of trouble. 



###### 24 

Mockers are proud and haughty; they act with boundless arrogance. 



###### 25 

Despite their desires, the lazy will come to ruin, for their hands refuse to work. 



###### 26 

Some people are always greedy for more, but the godly love to give! 



###### 27 

The sacrifice of an evil person is detestable, especially when it is offered with wrong motives. 



###### 28 

A false witness will be cut off, but a credible witness will be allowed to speak. 



###### 29 

The wicked bluff their way through, but the virtuous think before they act. 



###### 30 

No human wisdom or understanding or plan can stand against the LORD. 



###### 31 

The horse is prepared for the day of battle, but the victory belongs to the LORD. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

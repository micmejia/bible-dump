# Proverbs 28

***




###### 1 

The wicked run away when no one is chasing them, but the godly are as bold as lions. 



###### 2 

When there is moral rot within a nation, its government topples easily. But wise and knowledgeable leaders bring stability. 



###### 3 

A poor person who oppresses the poor is like a pounding rain that destroys the crops. 



###### 4 

To reject the law is to praise the wicked; to obey the law is to fight them. 



###### 5 

Evil people don't understand justice, but those who follow the LORD understand completely. 



###### 6 

Better to be poor and honest than to be dishonest and rich. 



###### 7 

Young people who obey the law are wise; those with wild friends bring shame to their parents.[^a] 



###### 8 

Income from charging high interest rates will end up in the pocket of someone who is kind to the poor. 



###### 9 

God detests the prayers of a person who ignores the law. 



###### 10 

Those who lead good people along an evil path will fall into their own trap, but the honest will inherit good things. 



###### 11 

Rich people may think they are wise, but a poor person with discernment can see right through them. 



###### 12 

When the godly succeed, everyone is glad. When the wicked take charge, people go into hiding. 



###### 13 

People who conceal their sins will not prosper, but if they confess and turn from them, they will receive mercy. 



###### 14 

Blessed are those who fear to do wrong,[^b] but the stubborn are headed for serious trouble. 



###### 15 

A wicked ruler is as dangerous to the poor as a roaring lion or an attacking bear. 



###### 16 

A ruler with no understanding will oppress his people, but one who hates corruption will have a long life. 



###### 17 

A murderer's tormented conscience will drive him into the grave. Don't protect him! 



###### 18 

The blameless will be rescued from harm, but the crooked will be suddenly destroyed. 



###### 19 

A hard worker has plenty of food, but a person who chases fantasies ends up in poverty. 



###### 20 

The trustworthy person will get a rich reward, but a person who wants quick riches will get into trouble. 



###### 21 

Showing partiality is never good, yet some will do wrong for a mere piece of bread. 



###### 22 

Greedy people try to get rich quick but don't realize they're headed for poverty. 



###### 23 

In the end, people appreciate honest criticism far more than flattery. 



###### 24 

Anyone who steals from his father and mother and says, "What's wrong with that?" is no better than a murderer. 



###### 25 

Greed causes fighting; trusting the LORD leads to prosperity. 



###### 26 

Those who trust their own insight are foolish, but anyone who walks in wisdom is safe. 



###### 27 

Whoever gives to the poor will lack nothing, but those who close their eyes to poverty will be cursed. 



###### 28 

When the wicked take charge, people go into hiding. When the wicked meet disaster, the godly flourish. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

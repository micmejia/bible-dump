# Psalms 1

***




###### 1 

Oh, the joys of those who do not follow the advice of the wicked, or stand around with sinners, or join in with mockers. 



###### 2 

But they delight in the law of the LORD, meditating on it day and night. 



###### 3 

They are like trees planted along the riverbank, bearing fruit each season. Their leaves never wither, and they prosper in all they do. 



###### 4 

But not the wicked! They are like worthless chaff, scattered by the wind. 



###### 5 

They will be condemned at the time of judgment. Sinners will have no place among the godly. 



###### 6 

For the LORD watches over the path of the godly, but the path of the wicked leads to destruction. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

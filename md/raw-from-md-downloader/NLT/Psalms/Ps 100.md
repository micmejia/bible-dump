# Psalms 100

***




###### 1 

Shout with joy to the LORD, all the earth! 



###### 2 

Worship the LORD with gladness. Come before him, singing with joy. 



###### 3 

Acknowledge that the LORD is God! He made us, and we are his.[^a] We are his people, the sheep of his pasture. 



###### 4 

Enter his gates with thanksgiving; go into his courts with praise. Give thanks to him and praise his name. 



###### 5 

For the LORD is good. His unfailing love continues forever, and his faithfulness continues to each generation. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

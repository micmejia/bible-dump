# Psalms 11

***




###### 1 

I trust in the LORD for protection. So why do you say to me, "Fly like a bird to the mountains for safety! 



###### 2 

The wicked are stringing their bows and fitting their arrows on the bowstrings. They shoot from the shadows at those whose hearts are right. 



###### 3 

The foundations of law and order have collapsed. What can the righteous do?" 



###### 4 

But the LORD is in his holy Temple; the LORD still rules from heaven. He watches everyone closely, examining every person on earth. 



###### 5 

The LORD examines both the righteous and the wicked. He hates those who love violence. 



###### 6 

He will rain down blazing coals and burning sulfur on the wicked, punishing them with scorching winds. 



###### 7 

For the righteous LORD loves justice. The virtuous will see his face. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

Praise the LORD! Yes, give praise, O servants of the LORD. Praise the name of the LORD! 



###### 2 

Blessed be the name of the LORD now and forever. 



###### 3 

Everywhere--from east to west-- praise the name of the LORD. 



###### 4 

For the LORD is high above the nations; his glory is higher than the heavens. 



###### 5 

Who can be compared with the LORD our God, who is enthroned on high? 



###### 6 

He stoops to look down on heaven and on earth. 



###### 7 

He lifts the poor from the dust and the needy from the garbage dump. 



###### 8 

He sets them among princes, even the princes of his own people!

He gives the childless woman a family, making her a happy mother.

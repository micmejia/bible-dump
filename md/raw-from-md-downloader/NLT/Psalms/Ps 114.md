# Psalms 114

***




###### 1 

When the Israelites escaped from Egypt-- when the family of Jacob left that foreign land-- 



###### 2 

the land of Judah became God's sanctuary, and Israel became his kingdom. 



###### 3 

The Red Sea[^a] saw them coming and hurried out of their way! The water of the Jordan River turned away. 



###### 4 

The mountains skipped like rams, the hills like lambs! 



###### 5 

What's wrong, Red Sea, that made you hurry out of their way? What happened, Jordan River, that you turned away? 



###### 6 

Why, mountains, did you skip like rams? Why, hills, like lambs? 



###### 7 

Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob. 



###### 8 

He turned the rock into a pool of water; yes, a spring of water flowed from solid rock. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

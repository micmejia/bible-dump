# Psalms 120

***




###### 1 

I took my troubles to the LORD; I cried out to him, and he answered my prayer. 



###### 2 

Rescue me, O LORD, from liars and from all deceitful people. 



###### 3 

O deceptive tongue, what will God do to you? How will he increase your punishment? 



###### 4 

You will be pierced with sharp arrows and burned with glowing coals. 



###### 5 

How I suffer in far-off Meshech. It pains me to live in distant Kedar. 



###### 6 

I am tired of living among people who hate peace. 



###### 7 

I search for peace; but when I speak of peace, they want war! ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

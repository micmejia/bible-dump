# Psalms 121

***




###### 1 

I look up to the mountains-- does my help come from there? 



###### 2 

My help comes from the LORD, who made heaven and earth! 



###### 3 

He will not let you stumble; the one who watches over you will not slumber. 



###### 4 

Indeed, he who watches over Israel never slumbers or sleeps. 



###### 5 

The LORD himself watches over you! The LORD stands beside you as your protective shade. 



###### 6 

The sun will not harm you by day, nor the moon at night. 



###### 7 

The LORD keeps you from all harm and watches over your life. 



###### 8 

The LORD keeps watch over you as you come and go, both now and forever. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

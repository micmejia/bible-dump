# Psalms 122

***




###### 1 

I was glad when they said to me, "Let us go to the house of the LORD." 



###### 2 

And now here we are, standing inside your gates, O Jerusalem. 



###### 3 

Jerusalem is a well-built city; its seamless walls cannot be breached. 



###### 4 

All the tribes of Israel--the LORD's people-- make their pilgrimage here. They come to give thanks to the name of the LORD, as the law requires of Israel. 



###### 5 

Here stand the thrones where judgment is given, the thrones of the dynasty of David. 



###### 6 

Pray for peace in Jerusalem. May all who love this city prosper. 



###### 7 

O Jerusalem, may there be peace within your walls and prosperity in your palaces. 



###### 8 

For the sake of my family and friends, I will say, "May you have peace." 



###### 9 

For the sake of the house of the LORD our God, I will seek what is best for you, O Jerusalem. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

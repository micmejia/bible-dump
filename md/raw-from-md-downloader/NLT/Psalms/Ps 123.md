# Psalms 123

***




###### 1 

I lift my eyes to you, O God, enthroned in heaven. 



###### 2 

We keep looking to the LORD our God for his mercy, just as servants keep their eyes on their master, as a slave girl watches her mistress for the slightest signal. 



###### 3 

Have mercy on us, LORD, have mercy, for we have had our fill of contempt. 



###### 4 

We have had more than our fill of the scoffing of the proud and the contempt of the arrogant. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

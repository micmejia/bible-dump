# Psalms 124

***




###### 1 

What if the LORD had not been on our side? Let all Israel repeat: 



###### 2 

What if the LORD had not been on our side when people attacked us? 



###### 3 

They would have swallowed us alive in their burning anger. 



###### 4 

The waters would have engulfed us; a torrent would have overwhelmed us. 



###### 5 

Yes, the raging waters of their fury would have overwhelmed our very lives. 



###### 6 

Praise the LORD, who did not let their teeth tear us apart! 



###### 7 

We escaped like a bird from a hunter's trap. The trap is broken, and we are free! 



###### 8 

Our help is from the LORD, who made heaven and earth. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Psalms 125

***




###### 1 

Those who trust in the LORD are as secure as Mount Zion; they will not be defeated but will endure forever. 



###### 2 

Just as the mountains surround Jerusalem, so the LORD surrounds his people, both now and forever. 



###### 3 

The wicked will not rule the land of the godly, for then the godly might be tempted to do wrong. 



###### 4 

O LORD, do good to those who are good, whose hearts are in tune with you. 



###### 5 

But banish those who turn to crooked ways, O LORD. Take them away with those who do evil.

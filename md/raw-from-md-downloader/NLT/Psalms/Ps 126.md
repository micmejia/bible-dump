# Psalms 126

***




###### 1 

When the LORD brought back his exiles to Jerusalem,[^a] it was like a dream! 



###### 2 

We were filled with laughter, and we sang for joy. And the other nations said, "What amazing things the LORD has done for them." 



###### 3 

Yes, the LORD has done amazing things for us! What joy! 



###### 4 

Restore our fortunes, LORD, as streams renew the desert. 



###### 5 

Those who plant in tears will harvest with shouts of joy. 



###### 6 

They weep as they go to plant their seed, but they sing as they return with the harvest. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

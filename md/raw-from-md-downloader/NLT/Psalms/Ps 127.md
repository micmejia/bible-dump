# Psalms 127

***




###### 1 

Unless the LORD builds a house, the work of the builders is wasted. Unless the LORD protects a city, guarding it with sentries will do no good. 



###### 2 

It is useless for you to work so hard from early morning until late at night, anxiously working for food to eat; for God gives rest to his loved ones. 



###### 3 

Children are a gift from the LORD; they are a reward from him. 



###### 4 

Children born to a young man are like arrows in a warrior's hands. 



###### 5 

How joyful is the man whose quiver is full of them! He will not be put to shame when he confronts his accusers at the city gates. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Psalms 128

***




###### 1 

How joyful are those who fear the LORD-- all who follow his ways! 



###### 2 

You will enjoy the fruit of your labor. How joyful and prosperous you will be! 



###### 3 

Your wife will be like a fruitful grapevine, flourishing within your home. Your children will be like vigorous young olive trees as they sit around your table. 



###### 4 

That is the LORD's blessing for those who fear him. 



###### 5 

May the LORD continually bless you from Zion. May you see Jerusalem prosper as long as you live. 



###### 6 

May you live to enjoy your grandchildren. May Israel have peace! ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

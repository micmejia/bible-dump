# Psalms 129

***




###### 1 

From my earliest youth my enemies have persecuted me. Let all Israel repeat this: 



###### 2 

From my earliest youth my enemies have persecuted me, but they have never defeated me. 



###### 3 

My back is covered with cuts, as if a farmer had plowed long furrows. 



###### 4 

But the LORD is good; he has cut me free from the ropes of the ungodly. 



###### 5 

May all who hate Jerusalem[^a] be turned back in shameful defeat. 



###### 6 

May they be as useless as grass on a rooftop, turning yellow when only half grown, 



###### 7 

ignored by the harvester, despised by the binder. 



###### 8 

And may those who pass by refuse to give them this blessing: "The LORD bless you; we bless you in the LORD's name." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

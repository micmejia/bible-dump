# Psalms 13

***




###### 1 

O LORD, how long will you forget me? Forever? How long will you look the other way? 



###### 2 

How long must I struggle with anguish in my soul, with sorrow in my heart every day? How long will my enemy have the upper hand? 



###### 3 

Turn and answer me, O LORD my God! Restore the sparkle to my eyes, or I will die. 



###### 4 

Don't let my enemies gloat, saying, "We have defeated him!" Don't let them rejoice at my downfall. 



###### 5 

But I trust in your unfailing love. I will rejoice because you have rescued me. 



###### 6 

I will sing to the LORD because he is good to me. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

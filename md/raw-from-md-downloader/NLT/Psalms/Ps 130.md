# Psalms 130

***




###### 1 

From the depths of despair, O LORD, I call for your help. 



###### 2 

Hear my cry, O Lord. Pay attention to my prayer. 



###### 3 

LORD, if you kept a record of our sins, who, O Lord, could ever survive? 



###### 4 

But you offer forgiveness, that we might learn to fear you. 



###### 5 

I am counting on the LORD; yes, I am counting on him. I have put my hope in his word. 



###### 6 

I long for the Lord more than sentries long for the dawn, yes, more than sentries long for the dawn. 



###### 7 

O Israel, hope in the LORD; for with the LORD there is unfailing love. His redemption overflows. 



###### 8 

He himself will redeem Israel from every kind of sin. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

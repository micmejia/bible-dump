# Psalms 142

***




###### 1 

I cry out to the LORD; I plead for the LORD's mercy. 



###### 2 

I pour out my complaints before him and tell him all my troubles. 



###### 3 

When I am overwhelmed, you alone know the way I should turn. Wherever I go, my enemies have set traps for me. 



###### 4 

I look for someone to come and help me, but no one gives me a passing thought! No one will help me; no one cares a bit what happens to me. 



###### 5 

Then I pray to you, O LORD. I say, "You are my place of refuge. You are all I really want in life. 



###### 6 

Hear my cry, for I am very low. Rescue me from my persecutors, for they are too strong for me. 



###### 7 

Bring me out of prison so I can thank you. The godly will crowd around me, for you are good to me." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

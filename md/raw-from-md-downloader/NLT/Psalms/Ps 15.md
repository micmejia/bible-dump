# Psalms 15

***




###### 1 

Who may worship in your sanctuary, LORD? Who may enter your presence on your holy hill? 



###### 2 

Those who lead blameless lives and do what is right, speaking the truth from sincere hearts. 



###### 3 

Those who refuse to gossip or harm their neighbors or speak evil of their friends. 



###### 4 

Those who despise flagrant sinners, and honor the faithful followers of the LORD, and keep their promises even when it hurts. 



###### 5 

Those who lend money without charging interest, and who cannot be bribed to lie about the innocent. Such people will stand firm forever. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

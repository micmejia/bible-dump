# Psalms 150

***




###### 1 

Praise the LORD! Praise God in his sanctuary; praise him in his mighty heaven! 



###### 2 

Praise him for his mighty works; praise his unequaled greatness! 



###### 3 

Praise him with a blast of the ram's horn; praise him with the lyre and harp! 



###### 4 

Praise him with the tambourine and dancing; praise him with strings and flutes! 



###### 5 

Praise him with a clash of cymbals; praise him with loud clanging cymbals. 



###### 6 

Let everything that breathes sing praises to the LORD!

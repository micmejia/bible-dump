# Psalms 2

***




###### 1 

Why are the nations so angry? Why do they waste their time with futile plans? 



###### 2 

The kings of the earth prepare for battle; the rulers plot together against the LORD and against his anointed one. 



###### 3 

"Let us break their chains," they cry, "and free ourselves from slavery to God." 



###### 4 

But the one who rules in heaven laughs. The Lord scoffs at them. 



###### 5 

Then in anger he rebukes them, terrifying them with his fierce fury. 



###### 6 

For the Lord declares, "I have placed my chosen king on the throne in Jerusalem,[^a] on my holy mountain." 



###### 7 

The king proclaims the LORD's decree: "The LORD said to me, 'You are my son.[^b] Today I have become your Father.[^c] 



###### 8 

Only ask, and I will give you the nations as your inheritance, the whole earth as your possession. 



###### 9 

You will break[^d] them with an iron rod and smash them like clay pots.'" 



###### 10 

Now then, you kings, act wisely! Be warned, you rulers of the earth! 



###### 11 

Serve the LORD with reverent fear, and rejoice with trembling. 



###### 12 

Submit to God's royal son,[^e] or he will become angry, and you will be destroyed in the midst of all your activities-- for his anger flares up in an instant. But what joy for all who take refuge in him! ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

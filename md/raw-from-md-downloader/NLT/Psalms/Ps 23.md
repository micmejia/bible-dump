# Psalms 23

***




###### 1 

The LORD is my shepherd; I have all that I need. 



###### 2 

He lets me rest in green meadows; he leads me beside peaceful streams. 



###### 3 

He renews my strength. He guides me along right paths, bringing honor to his name. 



###### 4 

Even when I walk through the darkest valley,[^a] I will not be afraid, for you are close beside me. Your rod and your staff protect and comfort me. 



###### 5 

You prepare a feast for me in the presence of my enemies. You honor me by anointing my head with oil. My cup overflows with blessings. 



###### 6 

Surely your goodness and unfailing love will pursue me all the days of my life, and I will live in the house of the LORD forever. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

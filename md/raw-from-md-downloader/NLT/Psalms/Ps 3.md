# Psalms 3

***




###### 1 

O LORD, I have so many enemies; so many are against me. 



###### 2 

So many are saying, "God will never rescue him!" Interlude[^a] 



###### 3 

But you, O LORD, are a shield around me; you are my glory, the one who holds my head high. 



###### 4 

I cried out to the LORD, and he answered me from his holy mountain. Interlude 



###### 5 

I lay down and slept, yet I woke up in safety, for the LORD was watching over me. 



###### 6 

I am not afraid of ten thousand enemies who surround me on every side. 



###### 7 

Arise, O LORD! Rescue me, my God! Slap all my enemies in the face! Shatter the teeth of the wicked! 



###### 8 

Victory comes from you, O LORD. May you bless your people.

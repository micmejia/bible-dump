# Psalms 4

***




###### 1 

Answer me when I call to you, O God who declares me innocent. Free me from my troubles. Have mercy on me and hear my prayer. 



###### 2 

How long will you people ruin my reputation? How long will you make groundless accusations? How long will you continue your lies? Interlude 



###### 3 

You can be sure of this: The LORD set apart the godly for himself. The LORD will answer when I call to him. 



###### 4 

Don't sin by letting anger control you. Think about it overnight and remain silent. Interlude 



###### 5 

Offer sacrifices in the right spirit, and trust the LORD. 



###### 6 

Many people say, "Who will show us better times?" Let your face smile on us, LORD. 



###### 7 

You have given me greater joy than those who have abundant harvests of grain and new wine. 



###### 8 

In peace I will lie down and sleep, for you alone, O LORD, will keep me safe. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

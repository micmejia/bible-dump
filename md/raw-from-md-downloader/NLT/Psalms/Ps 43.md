# Psalms 43

***




###### 1 

Declare me innocent, O God! Defend me against these ungodly people. Rescue me from these unjust liars. 



###### 2 

For you are God, my only safe haven. Why have you tossed me aside? Why must I wander around in grief, oppressed by my enemies? 



###### 3 

Send out your light and your truth; let them guide me. Let them lead me to your holy mountain, to the place where you live. 



###### 4 

There I will go to the altar of God, to God--the source of all my joy. I will praise you with my harp, O God, my God! 



###### 5 

Why am I discouraged? Why is my heart so sad? I will put my hope in God! I will praise him again-- my Savior and my God! ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

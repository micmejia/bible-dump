# Psalms 5

***




###### 1 

O LORD, hear me as I pray; pay attention to my groaning. 



###### 2 

Listen to my cry for help, my King and my God, for I pray to no one but you. 



###### 3 

Listen to my voice in the morning, LORD. Each morning I bring my requests to you and wait expectantly. 



###### 4 

O God, you take no pleasure in wickedness; you cannot tolerate the sins of the wicked. 



###### 5 

Therefore, the proud may not stand in your presence, for you hate all who do evil. 



###### 6 

You will destroy those who tell lies. The LORD detests murderers and deceivers. 



###### 7 

Because of your unfailing love, I can enter your house; I will worship at your Temple with deepest awe. 



###### 8 

Lead me in the right path, O LORD, or my enemies will conquer me. Make your way plain for me to follow. 



###### 9 

My enemies cannot speak a truthful word. Their deepest desire is to destroy others. Their talk is foul, like the stench from an open grave. Their tongues are filled with flattery.[^a] 



###### 10 

O God, declare them guilty. Let them be caught in their own traps. Drive them away because of their many sins, for they have rebelled against you. 



###### 11 

But let all who take refuge in you rejoice; let them sing joyful praises forever. Spread your protection over them, that all who love your name may be filled with joy. 



###### 12 

For you bless the godly, O LORD; you surround them with your shield of love. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

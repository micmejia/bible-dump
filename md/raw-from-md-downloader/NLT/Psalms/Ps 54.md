# Psalms 54

***




###### 1 

Come with great power, O God, and rescue me! Defend me with your might. 



###### 2 

Listen to my prayer, O God. Pay attention to my plea. 



###### 3 

For strangers are attacking me; violent people are trying to kill me. They care nothing for God. Interlude 



###### 4 

But God is my helper. The Lord keeps me alive! 



###### 5 

May the evil plans of my enemies be turned against them. Do as you promised and put an end to them. 



###### 6 

I will sacrifice a voluntary offering to you; I will praise your name, O LORD, for it is good. 



###### 7 

For you have rescued me from my troubles and helped me to triumph over my enemies. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

# Psalms 6

***




###### 1 

O LORD, don't rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your rage. 



###### 2 

Have compassion on me, LORD, for I am weak. Heal me, LORD, for my bones are in agony. 



###### 3 

I am sick at heart. How long, O LORD, until you restore me? 



###### 4 

Return, O LORD, and rescue me. Save me because of your unfailing love. 



###### 5 

For the dead do not remember you. Who can praise you from the grave?[^b] 



###### 6 

I am worn out from sobbing. All night I flood my bed with weeping, drenching it with my tears. 



###### 7 

My vision is blurred by grief; my eyes are worn out because of all my enemies. 



###### 8 

Go away, all you who do evil, for the LORD has heard my weeping. 



###### 9 

The LORD has heard my plea; the LORD will answer my prayer. 



###### 10 

May all my enemies be disgraced and terrified. May they suddenly turn back in shame. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

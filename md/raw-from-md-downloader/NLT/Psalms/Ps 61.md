# Psalms 61

***




###### 1 

O God, listen to my cry! Hear my prayer! 



###### 2 

From the ends of the earth, I cry to you for help when my heart is overwhelmed. Lead me to the towering rock of safety, 



###### 3 

for you are my safe refuge, a fortress where my enemies cannot reach me. 



###### 4 

Let me live forever in your sanctuary, safe beneath the shelter of your wings! Interlude 



###### 5 

For you have heard my vows, O God. You have given me an inheritance reserved for those who fear your name. 



###### 6 

Add many years to the life of the king! May his years span the generations! 



###### 7 

May he reign under God's protection forever. May your unfailing love and faithfulness watch over him. 



###### 8 

Then I will sing praises to your name forever as I fulfill my vows each day. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

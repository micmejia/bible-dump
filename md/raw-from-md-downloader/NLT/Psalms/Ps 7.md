# Psalms 7

***




###### 1 

I come to you for protection, O LORD my God. Save me from my persecutors--rescue me! 



###### 2 

If you don't, they will maul me like a lion, tearing me to pieces with no one to rescue me. 



###### 3 

O LORD my God, if I have done wrong or am guilty of injustice, 



###### 4 

if I have betrayed a friend or plundered my enemy without cause, 



###### 5 

then let my enemies capture me. Let them trample me into the ground and drag my honor in the dust. Interlude 



###### 6 

Arise, O LORD, in anger! Stand up against the fury of my enemies! Wake up, my God, and bring justice! 



###### 7 

Gather the nations before you. Rule over them from on high. 



###### 8 

The LORD judges the nations. Declare me righteous, O LORD, for I am innocent, O Most High! 



###### 9 

End the evil of those who are wicked, and defend the righteous. For you look deep within the mind and heart, O righteous God. 



###### 10 

God is my shield, saving those whose hearts are true and right. 



###### 11 

God is an honest judge. He is angry with the wicked every day. 



###### 12 

If a person does not repent, God[^b] will sharpen his sword; he will bend and string his bow. 



###### 13 

He will prepare his deadly weapons and shoot his flaming arrows. 



###### 14 

The wicked conceive evil; they are pregnant with trouble and give birth to lies. 



###### 15 

They dig a deep pit to trap others, then fall into it themselves. 



###### 16 

The trouble they make for others backfires on them. The violence they plan falls on their own heads. 



###### 17 

I will thank the LORD because he is just; I will sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

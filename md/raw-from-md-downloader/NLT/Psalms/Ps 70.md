# Psalms 70

***




###### 1 

Please, God, rescue me! Come quickly, LORD, and help me. 



###### 2 

May those who try to kill me be humiliated and put to shame. May those who take delight in my trouble be turned back in disgrace. 



###### 3 

Let them be horrified by their shame, for they said, "Aha! We've got him now!" 



###### 4 

But may all who search for you be filled with joy and gladness in you. May those who love your salvation repeatedly shout, "God is great!" 



###### 5 

But as for me, I am poor and needy; please hurry to my aid, O God. You are my helper and my savior; O LORD, do not delay. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

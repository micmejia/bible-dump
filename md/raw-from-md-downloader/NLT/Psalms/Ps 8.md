# Psalms 8

***




###### 1 

O LORD, our Lord, your majestic name fills the earth! Your glory is higher than the heavens. 



###### 2 

You have taught children and infants to tell of your strength,[^b] silencing your enemies and all who oppose you. 



###### 3 

When I look at the night sky and see the work of your fingers-- the moon and the stars you set in place-- 



###### 4 

what are mere mortals that you should think about them, human beings that you should care for them?[^c] 



###### 5 

Yet you made them only a little lower than God[^d] and crowned them[^e] with glory and honor. 



###### 6 

You gave them charge of everything you made, putting all things under their authority-- 



###### 7 

the flocks and the herds and all the wild animals, 



###### 8 

the birds in the sky, the fish in the sea, and everything that swims the ocean currents. 



###### 9

# Psalms 82

***




###### 1 

God presides over heaven's court; he pronounces judgment on the heavenly beings: 



###### 2 

"How long will you hand down unjust decisions by favoring the wicked? Interlude 



###### 3 

"Give justice to the poor and the orphan; uphold the rights of the oppressed and the destitute. 



###### 4 

Rescue the poor and helpless; deliver them from the grasp of evil people. 



###### 5 

But these oppressors know nothing; they are so ignorant! They wander about in darkness, while the whole world is shaken to the core. 



###### 6 

I say, 'You are gods; you are all children of the Most High. 



###### 7 

But you will die like mere mortals and fall like every other ruler.'" 



###### 8 

Rise up, O God, and judge the earth, for all the nations belong to you. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

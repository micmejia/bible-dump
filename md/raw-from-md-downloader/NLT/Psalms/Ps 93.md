# Psalms 93

***




###### 1 

The LORD is king! He is robed in majesty. Indeed, the LORD is robed in majesty and armed with strength. The world stands firm and cannot be shaken. 



###### 2 

Your throne, O LORD, has stood from time immemorial. You yourself are from the everlasting past. 



###### 3 

The floods have risen up, O LORD. The floods have roared like thunder; the floods have lifted their pounding waves. 



###### 4 

But mightier than the violent raging of the seas, mightier than the breakers on the shore-- the LORD above is mightier than these! 



###### 5 

Your royal laws cannot be changed. Your reign, O LORD, is holy forever and ever. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

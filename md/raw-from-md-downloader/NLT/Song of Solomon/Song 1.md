# Song of Solomon 1

***




###### 1 

This is Solomon's song of songs, more wonderful than any other. 



###### 2 

Kiss me and kiss me again, for your love is sweeter than wine. 



###### 3 

How pleasing is your fragrance; your name is like the spreading fragrance of scented oils. No wonder all the young women love you! 



###### 4 

Take me with you; come, let's run! The king has brought me into his bedroom. How happy we are for you, O king. We praise your love even more than wine. How right they are to adore you. 



###### 5 

I am dark but beautiful, O women of Jerusalem-- dark as the tents of Kedar, dark as the curtains of Solomon's tents. 



###### 6 

Don't stare at me because I am dark-- the sun has darkened my skin. My brothers were angry with me; they forced me to care for their vineyards, so I couldn't care for myself--my own vineyard. 



###### 7 

Tell me, my love, where are you leading your flock today? Where will you rest your sheep at noon? For why should I wander like a prostitute[^b] among your friends and their flocks? 



###### 8 

If you don't know, O most beautiful woman, follow the trail of my flock, and graze your young goats by the shepherds' tents. 



###### 9 

You are as exciting, my darling, as a mare among Pharaoh's stallions. 



###### 10 

How lovely are your cheeks; your earrings set them afire! How lovely is your neck, enhanced by a string of jewels. 



###### 11 

We will make for you earrings of gold and beads of silver. 



###### 12 

The king is lying on his couch, enchanted by the fragrance of my perfume. 



###### 13 

My lover is like a sachet of myrrh lying between my breasts. 



###### 14 

He is like a bouquet of sweet henna blossoms from the vineyards of En-gedi. 



###### 15 

How beautiful you are, my darling, how beautiful! Your eyes are like doves. 



###### 16 

You are so handsome, my love, pleasing beyond words! The soft grass is our bed; 



###### 17 

fragrant cedar branches are the beams of our house, and pleasant smelling firs are the rafters. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

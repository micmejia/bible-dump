# Song of Solomon 2

***




###### 1 

I am the spring crocus blooming on the Sharon Plain,[^a] the lily of the valley. 



###### 2 

Like a lily among thistles is my darling among young women. 



###### 3 

Like the finest apple tree in the orchard is my lover among other young men. I sit in his delightful shade and taste his delicious fruit. 



###### 4 

He escorts me to the banquet hall; it's obvious how much he loves me. 



###### 5 

Strengthen me with raisin cakes, refresh me with apples, for I am weak with love. 



###### 6 

His left arm is under my head, and his right arm embraces me. 



###### 7 

Promise me, O women of Jerusalem, by the gazelles and wild deer, not to awaken love until the time is right.[^b] 



###### 8 

Ah, I hear my lover coming! He is leaping over the mountains, bounding over the hills. 



###### 9 

My lover is like a swift gazelle or a young stag. Look, there he is behind the wall, looking through the window, peering into the room. 



###### 10 

My lover said to me, "Rise up, my darling! Come away with me, my fair one! 



###### 11 

Look, the winter is past, and the rains are over and gone. 



###### 12 

The flowers are springing up, the season of singing birds[^c] has come, and the cooing of turtledoves fills the air. 



###### 13 

The fig trees are forming young fruit, and the fragrant grapevines are blossoming. Rise up, my darling! Come away with me, my fair one!" 



###### 14 

My dove is hiding behind the rocks, behind an outcrop on the cliff. Let me see your face; let me hear your voice. For your voice is pleasant, and your face is lovely. 



###### 15 

Catch all the foxes, those little foxes, before they ruin the vineyard of love, for the grapevines are blossoming! 



###### 16 

My lover is mine, and I am his. He browses among the lilies. 



###### 17 

Before the dawn breezes blow and the night shadows flee, return to me, my love, like a gazelle or a young stag on the rugged mountains.[^d] ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

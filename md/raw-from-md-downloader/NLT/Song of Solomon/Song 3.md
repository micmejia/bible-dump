# Song of Solomon 3

***




###### 1 

One night as I lay in bed, I yearned for my lover. I yearned for him, but he did not come. 



###### 2 

So I said to myself, "I will get up and roam the city, searching in all its streets and squares. I will search for the one I love." So I searched everywhere but did not find him. 



###### 3 

The watchmen stopped me as they made their rounds, and I asked, "Have you seen the one I love?" 



###### 4 

Then scarcely had I left them when I found my love! I caught and held him tightly, then I brought him to my mother's house, into my mother's bed, where I had been conceived. 



###### 5 

Promise me, O women of Jerusalem, by the gazelles and wild deer, not to awaken love until the time is right.[^a] 



###### 6 

Who is this sweeping in from the wilderness like a cloud of smoke? Who is it, fragrant with myrrh and frankincense and every kind of spice? 



###### 7 

Look, it is Solomon's carriage, surrounded by sixty heroic men, the best of Israel's soldiers. 



###### 8 

They are all skilled swordsmen, experienced warriors. Each wears a sword on his thigh, ready to defend the king against an attack in the night. 



###### 9 

King Solomon's carriage is built of wood imported from Lebanon. 



###### 10 

Its posts are silver, its canopy gold; its cushions are purple. It was decorated with love by the young women of Jerusalem. 



###### 11 

Come out to see King Solomon, young women of Jerusalem.[^b] He wears the crown his mother gave him on his wedding day, his most joyous day. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

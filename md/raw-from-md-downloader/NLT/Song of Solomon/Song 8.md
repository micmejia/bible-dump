# Song of Solomon 8

***




###### 1 

Oh, I wish you were my brother, who nursed at my mother's breasts. Then I could kiss you no matter who was watching, and no one would criticize me. 



###### 2 

I would bring you to my childhood home, and there you would teach me.[^a] I would give you spiced wine to drink, my sweet pomegranate wine. 



###### 3 

Your left arm would be under my head, and your right arm would embrace me. 



###### 4 

Promise me, O women of Jerusalem, not to awaken love until the time is right.[^b] 



###### 5 

Who is this sweeping in from the desert, leaning on her lover? I aroused you under the apple tree, where your mother gave you birth, where in great pain she delivered you. 



###### 6 

Place me like a seal over your heart, like a seal on your arm. For love is as strong as death, its jealousy[^c] as enduring as the grave.[^d] Love flashes like fire, the brightest kind of flame. 



###### 7 

Many waters cannot quench love, nor can rivers drown it. If a man tried to buy love with all his wealth, his offer would be utterly scorned. 



###### 8 

We have a little sister too young to have breasts. What will we do for our sister if someone asks to marry her? 



###### 9 

If she is a virgin, like a wall, we will protect her with a silver tower. But if she is promiscuous, like a swinging door, we will block her door with a cedar bar. 



###### 10 

I was a virgin, like a wall; now my breasts are like towers. When my lover looks at me, he is delighted with what he sees. 



###### 11 

Solomon has a vineyard at Baal-hamon, which he leases out to tenant farmers. Each of them pays a thousand pieces of silver for harvesting its fruit. 



###### 12 

But my vineyard is mine to give, and Solomon need not pay a thousand pieces of silver. But I will give two hundred pieces to those who care for its vines. 



###### 13 

O my darling, lingering in the gardens, your companions are fortunate to hear your voice. Let me hear it, too! 



###### 14 

Come away, my love! Be like a gazelle or a young stag on the mountains of spices. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

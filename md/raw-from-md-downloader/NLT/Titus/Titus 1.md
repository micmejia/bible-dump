# Titus 1

***




###### 1 

This letter is from Paul, a slave of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ. I have been sent to proclaim faith to[^a] those God has chosen and to teach them to know the truth that shows them how to live godly lives. 



###### 2 

This truth gives them confidence that they have eternal life, which God--who does not lie--promised them before the world began. 



###### 3 

And now at just the right time he has revealed this message, which we announce to everyone. It is by the command of God our Savior that I have been entrusted with this work for him. 



###### 4 

I am writing to Titus, my true son in the faith that we share. May God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior give you grace and peace. ## Titus's Work in Crete 



###### 5 

I left you on the island of Crete so you could complete our work there and appoint elders in each town as I instructed you. 



###### 6 

An elder must live a blameless life. He must be faithful to his wife,[^b] and his children must be believers who don't have a reputation for being wild or rebellious. 



###### 7 

A church leader[^c] is a manager of God's household, so he must live a blameless life. He must not be arrogant or quick-tempered; he must not be a heavy drinker,[^d] violent, or dishonest with money. 



###### 8 

Rather, he must enjoy having guests in his home, and he must love what is good. He must live wisely and be just. He must live a devout and disciplined life. 



###### 9 

He must have a strong belief in the trustworthy message he was taught; then he will be able to encourage others with wholesome teaching and show those who oppose it where they are wrong. 



###### 10 

For there are many rebellious people who engage in useless talk and deceive others. This is especially true of those who insist on circumcision for salvation. 



###### 11 

They must be silenced, because they are turning whole families away from the truth by their false teaching. And they do it only for money. 



###### 12 

Even one of their own men, a prophet from Crete, has said about them, "The people of Crete are all liars, cruel animals, and lazy gluttons."[^e] 



###### 13 

This is true. So reprimand them sternly to make them strong in the faith. 



###### 14 

They must stop listening to Jewish myths and the commands of people who have turned away from the truth. 



###### 15 

Everything is pure to those whose hearts are pure. But nothing is pure to those who are corrupt and unbelieving, because their minds and consciences are corrupted. 



###### 16 

Such people claim they know God, but they deny him by the way they live. They are detestable and disobedient, worthless for doing anything good. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

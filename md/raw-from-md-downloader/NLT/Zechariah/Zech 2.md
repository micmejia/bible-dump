# Zechariah 2

***




###### 1 

[^a]When I looked again, I saw a man with a measuring line in his hand. 



###### 2 

"Where are you going?" I asked. He replied, "I am going to measure Jerusalem, to see how wide and how long it is." 



###### 3 

Then the angel who was with me went to meet a second angel who was coming toward him. 



###### 4 

The other angel said, "Hurry, and say to that young man, 'Jerusalem will someday be so full of people and livestock that there won't be room enough for everyone! Many will live outside the city walls. 



###### 5 

Then I, myself, will be a protective wall of fire around Jerusalem, says the LORD. And I will be the glory inside the city!'" ## The Exiles Are Called Home 



###### 6 

The LORD says, "Come away! Flee from Babylon in the land of the north, for I have scattered you to the four winds. 



###### 7 

Come away, people of Zion, you who are exiled in Babylon!" 



###### 8 

After a period of glory, the LORD of Heaven's Armies sent me[^b] against the nations who plundered you. For he said, "Anyone who harms you harms my most precious possession.[^c] 



###### 9 

I will raise my fist to crush them, and their own slaves will plunder them." Then you will know that the LORD of Heaven's Armies has sent me. 



###### 10 

The LORD says, "Shout and rejoice, O beautiful Jerusalem,[^d] for I am coming to live among you. 



###### 11 

Many nations will join themselves to the LORD on that day, and they, too, will be my people. I will live among you, and you will know that the LORD of Heaven's Armies sent me to you. 



###### 12 

The land of Judah will be the LORD's special possession in the holy land, and he will once again choose Jerusalem to be his own city. 



###### 13 

Be silent before the LORD, all humanity, for he is springing into action from his holy dwelling." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

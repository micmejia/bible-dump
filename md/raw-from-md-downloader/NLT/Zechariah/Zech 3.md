# Zechariah 3

***




###### 1 

Then the angel showed me Jeshua[^a] the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD. The Accuser, Satan,[^b] was there at the angel's right hand, making accusations against Jeshua. 



###### 2 

And the LORD said to Satan, "I, the LORD, reject your accusations, Satan. Yes, the LORD, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebukes you. This man is like a burning stick that has been snatched from the fire." 



###### 3 

Jeshua's clothing was filthy as he stood there before the angel. 



###### 4 

So the angel said to the others standing there, "Take off his filthy clothes." And turning to Jeshua he said, "See, I have taken away your sins, and now I am giving you these fine new clothes." 



###### 5 

Then I said, "They should also place a clean turban on his head." So they put a clean priestly turban on his head and dressed him in new clothes while the angel of the LORD stood by. 



###### 6 

Then the angel of the LORD spoke very solemnly to Jeshua and said, 



###### 7 

"This is what the LORD of Heaven's Armies says: If you follow my ways and carefully serve me, then you will be given authority over my Temple and its courtyards. I will let you walk among these others standing here. 



###### 8 

"Listen to me, O Jeshua the high priest, and all you other priests. You are symbols of things to come. Soon I am going to bring my servant, the Branch. 



###### 9 

Now look at the jewel I have set before Jeshua, a single stone with seven facets.[^c] I will engrave an inscription on it, says the LORD of Heaven's Armies, and I will remove the sins of this land in a single day. 



###### 10 

"And on that day, says the LORD of Heaven's Armies, each of you will invite your neighbor to sit with you peacefully under your own grapevine and fig tree." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

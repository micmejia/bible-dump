# Zechariah 4

***




###### 1 

Then the angel who had been talking with me returned and woke me, as though I had been asleep. 



###### 2 

"What do you see now?" he asked. I answered, "I see a solid gold lampstand with a bowl of oil on top of it. Around the bowl are seven lamps, each having seven spouts with wicks. 



###### 3 

And I see two olive trees, one on each side of the bowl." 



###### 4 

Then I asked the angel, "What are these, my lord? What do they mean?" 



###### 5 

"Don't you know?" the angel asked. "No, my lord," I replied. 



###### 6 

Then he said to me, "This is what the LORD says to Zerubbabel: It is not by force nor by strength, but by my Spirit, says the LORD of Heaven's Armies. 



###### 7 

Nothing, not even a mighty mountain, will stand in Zerubbabel's way; it will become a level plain before him! And when Zerubbabel sets the final stone of the Temple in place, the people will shout: 'May God bless it! May God bless it!'[^a]" 



###### 8 

Then another message came to me from the LORD: 



###### 9 

"Zerubbabel is the one who laid the foundation of this Temple, and he will complete it. Then you will know that the LORD of Heaven's Armies has sent me. 



###### 10 

Do not despise these small beginnings, for the LORD rejoices to see the work begin, to see the plumb line in Zerubbabel's hand." (The seven lamps[^b] represent the eyes of the LORD that search all around the world.) 



###### 11 

Then I asked the angel, "What are these two olive trees on each side of the lampstand, 



###### 12 

and what are the two olive branches that pour out golden oil through two gold tubes?" 



###### 13 

"Don't you know?" he asked. "No, my lord," I replied. 



###### 14 

Then he said to me, "They represent the two anointed ones[^c] who stand in the court of the Lord of all the earth." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 501 Nelson Pl, Nashville, TN 37214 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.

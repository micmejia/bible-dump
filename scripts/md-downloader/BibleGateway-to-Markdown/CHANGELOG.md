# CHANGELOG

### v1.4.0, 1.2.2021

### v1.3.0, 29.12.2020
- [New] Add ability to parse and show cross-references (or suppress with `-r` option), as seen in NIV and ESV versions, for example.
- [New] Handle the unusual (unique?) multi-verse numbering in the MSG version.

### v1.2.1, 2.12.2020
- [Improve] The reference term is concatenated to remove spaces, meaning it doesn't need to be 'quoted'. It does not yet support multiple passages.
